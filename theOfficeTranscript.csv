Michael,All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim,"Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So..."
Michael,"So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?"
Jim,"Actually, you called me in here, but yeah."
Michael,"All right. Well, let me show you how it's done."
Michael,"Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... So that's the way it's done."
Michael,"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?"
Pam,Well. I don't know.
Michael,"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago."
Pam,What?
Michael,Any messages?
Pam,"Uh, yeah. Just a fax."
Michael,"Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate."
Pam,You haven't told me.
Michael,It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
Michael,"People say I am the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious."" ""And you get the best out of us."" I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts."
Dwight,Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum
Jim,"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this."
Michael,Whassup!
Jim,Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Michael,Whassup!
Dwight,Whassup!
Michael,Whass...up!
Dwight,Whassup.
Michael,What?
Jim,Nothing.
Michael,OK. All right. See you later.
Jim,All right. Take care.
Michael,Back to work.
Jan,Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael,"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah."
Jan,"Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?"
Michael,Um... Me no get an agenda.
Jan,What? I'm sorry?
Michael,I didn't get any agenda.
Jan,"Well, I faxed one over to you this morning."
Michael,Really? I didn't... Did we get a fax this morning?
Pam,"Uh, yeah, the one..."
Michael,"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?"
Pam,You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Michael,"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes."
Jan,Do you want to look at mine?
Michael,"Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you."
Jan,"OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch."
Michael,OK...
Jan,"Michael, don't panic."
Michael,"No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent."
Jan,"No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided."
Michael,All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
Jan,I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
Michael,OK. No problem.
Jan,"This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing."
Michael,"Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?"
Michael,"Question. How long do we have to... Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?"
Jan,Go ahead.
Michel,Packman.
Todd Packer,"Hey, you big queen."
Michael,"Oh, that's not appropriate."
Todd Packer,"Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?"
Michael,"Uh, I don't know what you mean."
Todd Packer,I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Michael,"Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person."
Jan,So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
Michael,"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that."
Phyllis,So what does downsizing actually mean?
Stanley,Well...
Oscar,You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Angela,I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
Kevin,"Yeah, it'll be you."
Pam,I have an important question for you.
Jim,Yes?
Pam,Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
Jim,"Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous."
Michael,"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
Michael,Hey.
Ryan,Hey.
Pam,This is Mr. Scott.
Michael,Guilty! Guilty as charged!
Ryan,Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Michael,"Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges."
Ryan,Yup.
Michael,"Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler."
Pam,"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good."
Pam,Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Jim,"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?"
Dwight,What?
Jim,What are you doing?
Dwight,Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
Jim,It's not on your desk.
Dwight,"It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation."
Dwight,You can't do that.
Jim,Why not?
Dwight,Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
Jim,We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
Dwight,Downsizing?
Dwight,"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on."
Pam,You just still have these messages from yesterday.
Michael,"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it."
Pam,What?
Michael,"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise."
Pam,Don't we all?
Michael,I'm sorry?
Pam,Nothing.
Michael,"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional."
Michael,"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP."
Michael,"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable."
Michael,Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
Dwight,I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Michael,Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight,"OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?"
Michael,I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
Oscar,Can't you just tell us.
Dwight,"Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?"
Michael,You don't know what it is.
Dwight,OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Michael,I don't need your permission.
Dwight,Go ahead.
Michael,Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
Ryan,I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
Oscar,"Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?"
Michael,Not gonna happen.
Stanley,It could be out of your hands Michael.
Michael,"It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that."
Stanley,Can you promise that?
Dwight,On his mother's grave.
Michael,No.
Phyllis,What?
Michael,"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it."
Stanley,It's just that we need to know.
Michael,"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then."
Pam,I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Man,Are you sure about that?
Michael,"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings."
Dwight,"Pam, information is power."
Stanley,"You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?"
Michael,"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."
Jim,"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry."
Pam,"Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um..."
Michael,"Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp."
Ryan,What's up? Nice to meet you.
Michael,Introduce yourself. Be polite.
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager."
Michael,"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything."
Dwight,"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand."
Michael,That's his profit.
Dwight,"New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos."
Dwight,Damn it! Jim!
Michael,"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?"
Dwight,He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
Pam,
Dwight,That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
Dwight,"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules."
Michael,What is that?
Dwight,That is my stapler.
Michael,"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food."
Dwight,"OK you know what, you can be a witness. Can you reprimand him?"
Jim,How do you know it was me?
Dwight,It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Michael,"Discipline. Kinky! All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop."
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O."
Jim,"OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan."
Michael,Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
Ryan,You should've put him in custardy.
Michael,Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
Dwight,"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all."
Michael,Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
Jim,Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
Pam,So when are we going out?
Jim,"Tonight, hopefully."
Pam,OK. Yeah.
Roy,"Hey, man."
Jim,What's going on?
Roy,"Hey, baby."
Pam,Hey.
Pam,Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Pam,Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
Roy,"No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home."
Pam,OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
Jim,You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Roy,"It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going."
Jim,"Yeah, yeah."
Jim,Um... What's in the bag?
Roy,Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
Jim,"No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do."
Jim,Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?
Michael,"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?"
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?"
Ryan,All right.
Michael,"Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to..."
Pam,You got a fax.
Michael,"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first."
Pam,What? Why?
Michael,"Why? Well, theft and stealing."
Pam,Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Michael,Post-it Notes.
Pam,"Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?"
Michael,"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam."
Pam,Are you serious?
Michael,Yeah. I am.
Pam,I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
Michael,But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
Michael,"You been X'd punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you."
Pam,You're a jerk.
Michael,I don't know about that.
Michael,"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, ""Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?"" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked."
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Jim,How are things?
Pam,Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
Jim,"Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?"
Pam,"It's better, thanks."
Jim,Good. Good.
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,That's great
Pam,Is...?
Jim,Yeah?
Pam,Um... Are you...
Jim,Am I walking out?
Pam,Yes.
Jim,"Yes, I... Do you want to..."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,Great. Let me just...
Jim,"Oh, Roy."
Pam,"Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend."
Jim,"Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here."
Michael,"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?"
Mr. Brown,"Oh, I'm all set, thanks."
Michael,Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
Michael,"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited."
Jim,"That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, ""100% post-consumer content."" What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second."
Jim,Do you really have to do that right now?
Dwight,Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Jim,"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... Hello? Thanks, Dwight."
Dwight,Retaliation. Tit for tit.
Jim,That is not the expression.
Dwight,"Well, it should be."
Jim,"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?"
Jim,Solitaire?
Pam,"Yeah, Freecell."
Jim,Six on seven.
Pam,I know. I saw that.
Jim,"So then, why didn't you do it?"
Pam,I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Jim,Who doesn't love that?
Michael,"Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?"
Oscar,All right.
Michael,Did you have a good weekend going there?
Oscar,It was fine.
Michael,"Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. Oh, hey! This is Oscar---"
Oscar,Martinez.
Michael,"Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!"
Mr. Brown,Great. We're all set.
Michael,"Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?"
Jim,"Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please."
Michael,"It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day."
Jim,You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Mr. Brown,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Michael,"Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!"
Mr. Brown,"Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance."
Michael,"You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race."
Mr. Brown,"Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind."
Michael,"Exactly, were not..."
Mr. Brown,That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
Michael,With tolerance.
Mr. Brown,No. With more ignorance.
Michael,Ignorance.
Mr. Brown,"Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity."
Michael,Let's celebrate.
Mr. Brown,Right. OK.
Michael,Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
Mr. Brown,"Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that..."
Michael,You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
Dwight,I have two. White and Indian.
Mr. Brown,"Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?"
Michael,Yes.
Mr. Brown,Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
Michael,OK.
Mr. Brown,"Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out."
Dwight,A few of the ground rules?
Michael,"Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him."
Dwight,"OK, can we steer away from gay people?"
Mr. Brown,Um...
Dwight,"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox."
Mr. Brown,"Well, we only have an hour."
Dwight,I figured it would save time.
Michael,OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
Mr. Brown,Mr. Brown.
Michael,"Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that."
Mr. Brown,"Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK."
Michael,"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?"
Mr. Brown,So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
Michael,I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Mr. Brown,"Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment."
Michael,"OK, I will play guy listening."
Mr. Brown,"Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?"
Kevin,I remember.
Mr. Brown,Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
Michael,OK.
Michael,Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
Kevin,"Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess."
Michael,"OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... I take care of my kid!"
Mr. Brown,Wait a second.
Michael,They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
Mr. Brown,Stop it!
Michael,What you want a cookie?
Mr. Brown,"Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness."
Dwight,"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero."
Mr. Brown,"Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?"
Dwight,"A hero kills people, people that wish him harm."
Mr. Brown,OK.
Dwight,"A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged."
Mr. Brown,"Ok, you're thinking of a superhero."
Dwight,We all have a hero in our heart.
Mr. Brown,"Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge."
Michael,I don't think I can sign this.
Mr. Brown,I can't leave until you do.
Michael,"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?"
Mr. Brown,"Michael, can I talk to you candidly?"
Michael,Sure.
Mr. Brown,We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
Michael,"Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit."
Mr. Brown,"Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature."
Michael,"OK, well I know. You told me that several times."
Mr. Brown,"Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need."
Michael,OK.
Mr. Brown,Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
Michael,"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't."
Mr. Brown,Don't worry about dating.
Michael,I won't.
Mr. Brown,OK. Thank you.
Michael,"Yeah, yeah."
Michael,"""I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..."" Open-mindedness, is that even a word? ""...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck."" He's going to lose it when he reads that."
Jim,"Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you."
Michael,"""I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart."" I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, ""Mr. Brown,"" he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears."
Michael,All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
Toby,"Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we?"
Michael,Get out.
Toby,I'm sorry.
Michael,"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape."
Michael,"Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, ""If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North."" And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace."
Michael,OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
Jim,
Michael,Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
Kevin,It was kind of hard to hear.
Michael,"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um..."
Kelly,I have a customer meeting.
Michael,"Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian."
Oscar,What part Native American?
Michael,Two fifteenths.
Oscar,"Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense."
Michael,"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on."
Oscar,"OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico."
Michael,"Oh, yeah..."
Oscar,"And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States."
Michael,Wow.
Oscar,My parents were Mexican.
Michael,"Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?"
Oscar,Thank... Yeah...
Michael,"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?"
Oscar,Mexican isn't offensive.
Michael,"Well, it has certain connotations."
Oscar,Like what?
Michael,Like... I don't... I don't know.
Oscar,"What connotations, Michael? You meant something."
Michael,"No. Now, remember that honesty..."
Oscar,I'm just curious.
Michael,"...empathy, respect... Jim! Jim!"
Jim,Hello? Hello?
Michael,"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done."
Michael,Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
Michael,Oh this is a good one.
Pam,"Um, hi. How are you?"
Stanley,Fine. How are you?
Pam,Great.
Michael,Push it.
Stanley,I admire your culture's success in America.
Pam,Thank you.
Michael,Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
Stanley,Who am I supposed to be?
Michael,"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that."
Dwight,"Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me."
Dwight,Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Pam,"That's nice, Dwight."
Dwight,"OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick."
Pam,"OK, I like your food."
Dwight,"Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate!"
Michael,"Pam, come on. ""I like your food."" Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real."
Pam,"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver."
Dwight,"Oh, man, am I a woman?"
Michael,"You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. ""Too soon for Arabs."" Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court."
Jim,What are you watching?
Ryan,Chappelle's Show.
Jim,Really?
Ryan,I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Jim,No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Ryan,"Great. She's cute, huh?"
Jim,"Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but..."
Ryan,"Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch."
Jim,"Oh, yeah. She's hot."
Kevin,Hey.
Angela,Hey.
Kevin,You wanna go to the beach?
Angela,Sure.
Kevin,You wanna get high?
Angela,No.
Kevin,"I think you do, mon."
Angela,Stop...
Michael,OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
Michael,"Kelly, how are you?"
Kelly,I just had the longest meeting.
Michael,"Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my..."
Michael,"All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority."
Jim,"Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you."
Michael,"I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food."
Kevin,Maybe some spagh-etti.
Michael,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai."
Stanley,It's collard greens.
Michael,What?
Stanley,It's collard greens.
Michael,"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice."
Jim,Um... Hey.
Pam,Mmmm.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,Oh.
Jim,We can go.
Pam,Sorry.
Jim,That's fine.
Jim,Uh... Not a bad day.
Michael,Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
Pam,I'm not making any copies.
Michael,"Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway."
Pam,Nothing new.
Michael,Lay them on me. What?
Pam,There's nothing new.
Michael,That's not what you said earlier.
Pam,"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the..."
Michael,"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist."
Jan,"So, which health plan have you decided on?"
Michael,"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works."
Jan,"Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?"
Michael,I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
Jan,The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Michael,"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good."
Jan,Michael.
Michael,You gotta crack these things open.
Jan,"You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan."
Michael,"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice."
Jan,It's your job. So...
Michael,"Well, it's a suicide mission, you know."
Jan,Michael... maybe... I mean...
Michael,"There, there..."
Jan,"Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time."
Michael,When have you ever done that?
Jan,I'm doing it right now. To you.
Jim,"Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?"
Pam,No. I have a life.
Jim,"Interesting, what's that like?"
Pam,You should try it sometime.
Jim,Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Pam,... your problem.
Michael,Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
Michael,"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers."
Jim,Gosh.
Michael,Yeah!
Jim,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Michael,Really?
Jim,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?"
Jim,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it."
Dwight,Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Jim,"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train."
Dwight,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?"
Michael,"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan."
Dwight,"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine."
Michael,You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Dwight,"Yes, I have an office. Bigger than his."
Michael,"Nope, you cannot use it."
Dwight,"OK, I take it back, it's a workspace."
Michael,Temporary workspace. You can use it.
Dwight,Thank you.
Michael,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already."
Dwight,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
Dwight,"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, ""Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead."" Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead."
Stanley,"There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible."
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
Michael,"Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?"
Pam,Where are you?
Michael,"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?"
Pam,"Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the..."
Michael,"Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call."
Pam,No you're not.
Michael,"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?"
Pam,OK.
Michael,"Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this."
Pam,Still no one calling.
Pam,"Dwight, what..."
Dwight,"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office."
Jim,"It says ""workspace""."
Dwight,Same thing.
Jim,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write ""workspace""?"
Dwight,"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior."
Jim,You are not my superior.
Dwight,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?"
Jim,I thought it was a workspace?
Pam,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
Dwight,Yes. And my decision in final.
Pam,This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Dwight,"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it."
Jim,"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?"
Dwight,Sure.
Jim,"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?"
Dwight,Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Jim,"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies."
Dwight,"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will."
Pam,Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Dwight,So I can lower it.
Oscar,He literally won't come out of his office.
Kevin,He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Angela,Kevin! That's inappropriate.
Oscar,"Michael, can I talk to you?"
Michael,"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?"
Meredith,"Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?"
Michael,"Ah, what? Which memo?"
Pam,Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Michael,Is it a good plan?
Dwight,It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Oscar,It's like a pay decrease.
Pam,"Michael, he made huge cuts."
Michael,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?"
Dwight,"Yeah, you said..."
Michael,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?"
Dwight,I can handle that.
Michael,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?"
Oscar,This is not good.
Angela,It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
Oscar,What was that?
Angela,You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Kevin,What are you guys talking about?
Angela,"Nothing, Kevin."
Michael,"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, ""Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him."
Dwight,"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do."
Jim,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential."
Dwight,"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office."
Jim,Workspace.
Michael,You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Pam,Where are you going?
Michael,"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob."
Michael,"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend."
Travel Agent,"I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?"
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so..."
Jim,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Pam,I'm inventing new diseases.
Jim,"Oh, great."
Pam,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?"
Jim,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Pam,Nice.
Jim,Thank you.
Michael,"Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride."
Man on Phone,You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
Michael,Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Man on Phone,"It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly."
Michael,So it's not a free fall?
Man on Phone,It's an industrial coal elevator.
Michael,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?"
Michael,"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?"
Dwight,Damnit! Damnit Jim!
Dwight,"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them."
Jim,What are you talking about?
Dwight,"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony."
Jim,"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?"
Dwight,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection."
Dwight,"You did this, didn't you?"
Jim,Absolutely not.
Dwight,Yes you did.
Jim,No I didn't.
Dwight,"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!"
Jim,Killer nanorobots?
Pam,It's an epidemic.
Dwight,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. ""Count Choculitis"""
Jim,Sounds tough.
Dwight,Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Jim,Do you?
Dwight,I think you need to confess...
Jim,Mmm hmm.
Dwight,...the fact...
Jim,Yep.
Dwight,What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Jim,Good luck.
Dwight,Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...
Stanley,...the light green or green...
Jim,Jim Halpert.
Dwight,Let me out.
Jim,Who is this?
Dwight,Let me out or you're fired.
Jim,"No, you can't fire me."
Dwight,Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Jim,"OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep.] Jim Halpert."
Pam,"Hey, Jim. It's Pam."
Jim,Hey Pam! How are you?
Dwight,Jim! Open the door!
Pam,"Good, how are you? Busy?"
Jim,I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
Dwight,Jim!
Pam,"Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?"
Jim,"No, not at all."
Pam,You don't have anything you're doing?
Jim,I have nothing to do.
Dwight,Jim!
Pam,"Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything."
Dwight,Jim!
Jim,Oh yeah?
Pam,I might go to the mall.
Jim,The mall?
Dwight,Jim!
Pam,I need new shoes.
Jim,"Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?"
Jan,Hello?
Dwight,"Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould."
Jan,This is Jan.
Dwight,"Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert."
Jan,Who is this?
Dwight,Dwight Schrute.
Jan,From sales?
Dwight,Well...
Jan,Where's Michael Scott?
Dwight,He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Jan,"Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?"
Dwight,"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan."
Jan,Really?
Dwight,Yeah.
Jan,"OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately."
Dwight,"Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?"
Jan,No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
Dwight,"Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your..."
Michael,"Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism."
Ryan,Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Michael,"Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly."
Stanley,"Oh, thanks."
Michael,There you go.
Stanley,"This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day."
Michael,"Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it."
Dwight,Michael. Michael?
Michael,"Oh, Christ."
Dwight,"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options."
Dwight,"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered."
Stanley,What about confidentiality?
Dwight,"You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s."
Meredith,"Could you mean v*g1n*? Because if you do, I want that covered."
Dwight,I thought your v*g1n* was removed during your hysterectomy?
Meredith,A uterus is different from a v*g1n*. I still have a v*g1n*.
Dwight,"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?"
Kevin,That's a real thing.
Dwight,"Yeah, but no one here has it."
Kevin,Someone has it.
Kevin,Do you think we should go ?
Oscar,"I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... There he is."
Kevin,What is he doing?
Oscar,I don't know.
Oscar,Well?
Michael,"Well, what? You could be referring to anything."
Oscar,"OK, the health care plan."
Pam,Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Michael,"Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?"
Dwight,I most certainly did not.
Michael,"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday."
Angela,What about the surprise?
Michael,"Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?"
Stanley,We all think you don't have a surprise.
Michael,"All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!"
Michael,"When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."
Michael,"God, yeah... Ah! This..."
Michael,"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo."
Dwight,"Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her."
Dwight,Michael!?
Michael,"Oh! God. Dwight, come on..."
Dwight,I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
Michael,There's no downsizing.
Dwight,"I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?"
Michael,Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Dwight,"Yeah, so I don't have to worry?"
Michael,"Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?"
Michael,"But there's no downsizing, so just don't..."
Dwight,Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Michael,"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe."
Michael,"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, ""You're fired."" ""You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed."" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. ""You're foir-ed."" I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, ""You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want."" But that's unrealistic, so..."
Dwight,"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work."
Stanley,Why'd you do this?
Dwight,"I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?"
Michael,"Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?"
Michael,Who is it? Who's the birthday?
Pam,"Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up."
Michael,Next person on the...
Pam,Oh.
Michael,...calendar.
Pam,"Okay, umm... that would be Meredith."
Michael,"Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!"
Pam,But it's not until next month.
Michael,"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise."
Pam,You still want to have a party?
Michael,"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!"
Michael,"Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek."
Phyllis,"Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it."
Angela,What?
Phyllis,"I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind."
Angela,"No, yeah, I think that's a good idea."
Phyllis,Yeah?
Angela,What color do you guys think?
Phyllis,"Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red..."
Pam,How about green?
Angela,I think green is kind of whoreish.
Pam,This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
Michael,These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
Michael,"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious."
Angela,"Meredith's allergic to dairy, so..."
Michael,"She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so..."
Pam,It is... her birthday.
Michael,"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?"
Dwight,"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out."
Dwight,"Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?"
Jim,"Absolutely, I do."
Dwight,"Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected..."
Jim,"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me."
Dwight,Did you get your tickets?
Jim,To what?
Dwight,The gun show.
Jim,"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says ""No, Jim, here's a way."""
Dwight,There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
Pam,An alliance?
Jim,Oh yeah.
Pam,What does that even mean?
Jim,"I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure."
Jim,"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground."
Dwight,"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?"
Dwight,Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
Jim,What? No.
Dwight,Just now.
Jim,"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam."
Dwight,"Right, that's good, good, pursue this."
Jim,Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
Dwight,Mmm hmm.
Jim,"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away."
Dwight,Done.
Jim,All right.
Michael,"Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, ""Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers."" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, ""Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."""
Dwight,"They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?"
Jim,"Yeah, what do you think that's about?"
Dwight,Only one way to find out.
Jim,I'm on it.
Jim,You are not going to believe this.
Dwight,What? I believe it.
Jim,"Well, tensions were high in the kitchen."
Dwight,"I could tell, from the body language."
Jim,"Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?"
Kevin,Italian.
Jim,"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone..."
Kevin,Yeah.
Jim,"Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off."
Dwight,"Good, let 'em. It helps our cause."
Jim,"Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking..."
Dwight,"Oh, they're forming an alliance"
Toby,I love their sandwiches.
Jim,I love their sandwiches too.
Kevin,Their bread's really good.
Jim,Their bread is very good.
Dwight,Damn it. God!
Jim,"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off."
Dwight,God... Damn it! Why us?
Jim,"Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong."
Michael,"Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor."
Michael,"Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?"
Oscar,"Uh, I'm sorry to bother you."
Michael,"Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?"
Oscar,"My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if..."
Michael,What?
Oscar,Donate to the charity?
Michael,"Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here."
Oscar,Thank you.
Michael,"No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25."
Oscar,That's... that's... that's very generous.
Michael,"Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so..."
Pam,"Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?"
Jim,"Sure, what's up?"
Pam,"Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?"
Jim,Oh no?
Pam,"Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, ""These people are my friends."" But he's all like, ""This is confidential. You can't tell anybody."" But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything."
Jim,"No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me."
Pam,"OK, yeah."
Dwight,Jackpot.
Jim,That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
Michael,"Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
Dwight,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Michael,Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
Dwight,I don't think she'd be missed.
Michael,"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend."
Dwight,"Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies."
Michael,"I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside."
Dwight,She had a hysterectomy.
Michael,Which one is that again?
Dwight,That's where they remove the uterus.
Michael,"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?"
Dwight,It could be kind of funny.
Michael,"You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time."
Jim,"OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday."
Dwight,"Oh my God, we have to be there."
Jim,"I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there."
Dwight,"No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God."
Jim,What? What?
Dwight,I know. I know exactly what to do.
Jim,Great.
Dwight,"I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
Dwight,"This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything."
Jim,Good.
Ryan,Michael? Are you done yet?
Michael,"Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet."
Jim,"Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open."
Dwight,So tape it down.
Jim,I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
Dwight,"Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box."
Jim,"Thank you, thank you. OK."
Everybody,Surprise!
Meredith,Oh! Surprise.
Angela,"No, it's ah..."
Michael,"It's surprise Meredith. One, two..."
Everybody,Happy birthday to you.
Michael,Find a key.
Everybody,Happy birthday...
Jim,"So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?"
Dwight,"No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone."
Jim,Right... That's good.
Dwight,"Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me."
Everybody,"... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you..."
Michael,And many more!
Stanley,"Last year, five years ago..."
Michael,"You were surprised, weren't you?"
Meredith,Yes.
Michael,"You looked freaked, man. We said ""Surprise."" You were, like, ""What?"" ""What the hell's goin' on here?"" Good cake. Why don't you have some?"
Meredith,"Uh, I can't. Um..."
Michael,Come on. A little bit.
Meredith,I can't eat dairy.
Michael,"Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good."
Meredith,"Yeah, it makes me sick."
Michael,"You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good."
Pam,He's in a box?
Jim,"Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic."
Pam,"Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that..."
Dwight,Oh.
Michael,"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal."
Jim,"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?"
Michael,"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time."
Jim,"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give."
Michael,Is Oscar around?
Michael,"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so..."
Oscar,"Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is."
Michael,I know...
Oscar,"It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, ""However many dollars per mile."""
Michael,Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Oscar,I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?"
Oscar,Yeah.
Michael,How many miles did he do last year?
Oscar,"Last year, he walked 18 miles."
Michael,Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
Pam,Happy Birthday.
Michael,Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
Meredith,"""Happy Bird-day"" Um... ""Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still."""
Michael,I don't know about that.
Meredith,"That was Stanley. ""Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam."""
Michael,"Huh! Thanks, downer."
Meredith,"This is from Michael. ""Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age."""
Michael,Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
Meredith,"No, I... I get it. It's funny."
Michael,"You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... ""Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back."" 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?"
Meredith,You're right. You're right. Yes.
Michael,"Divorce. Um... OK, ""Meredith is so old..."""
Oscar,How old is she?
Michael,"Everybody? If... could do it? ""Meredith is so old..."""
Everybody,How old is she?
Michael,"""She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."""
Michael,"That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me."
Oscar,"Uh, nice party Michael."
Michael,"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that."
Angela,"Phyllis wanted red, I didn't."
Phyllis,"Oh, boy... You..."
Michael,"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25."
Oscar,Per mile.
Michael,"Per mile, yes."
Michael,"When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back."
Michael,"A check for the kids, and for the team."
Michael,"I want it to be like... ""Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?"" ""Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous."" ""Well, guess what, that was Michael Scott."" ""But it was anonymous, how do you know?"" ""Because I'm him."""
Oscar,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael,"Come here. Don't cash that till Friday, OK?"
Toby,Really? Today?
Ryan,Yeah.
Toby,"Oh, Happy Birthday."
Ryan,Thanks.
Toby,"Yeah, I could say something."
Ryan,"No, don't. Don't do that."
Jim,"OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box."
Pam,"Oh, tell me, tell me."
Jim,OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and...... spy on our other branch. No no no.
Jim,"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover."
Pam,That's perfect!
Jim,If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
Roy,What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
Jim,"No, no, dude, no."
Pam,"Hey, Hey!"
Jim,"No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa."
Pam,Come on.
Jim,"God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um..."
Pam,It's just office pranks.
Jim,"It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks."
Roy,An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
Dwight,I have absolutely no idea.
Roy,Come on.
Dwight,"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves."
Dwight,"That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson."
Michael,"Hey, you ready?"
Michael,"All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent, excellent."
Dwight,Michael!
Michael,"Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, ""This might be kinda fun."" And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together."
Michael,"Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you."
Dwight,"Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team."
Michael,"No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior."
Dwight,"Oh, please."
Michael,When I let him come to my pick-up game...
Dwight,I apologized for that.
Michael,I vouched for you.
Dwight,"Michael, I..."
Michael,"I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar."
Dwight,I can handle that.
Michael,"Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that."
Dwight,And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Michael,Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
Dwight,Same thing.
Michael,"No, it's not. It's lower, so..."
Dwight,It's close.
Dwight,"So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim."
Jim,"God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?"
Phyllis,Keep me out of it.
Pam,"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding."
Michael,"All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right."
Ryan,"Fine, don't worry about that."
Michael,"And here we have ""Mister Roger's Neighborhood."" Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs."
Lonny,What's up?
Michael,And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
Darryl,It's not my real name.
Michael,"No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs."
Ryan,Darryl Rogers?
Darryl,"Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers."
Michael,"And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs."
Ryan,"Yeah, yeah."
Michael,"You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!"
Pam,"No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years."
Jim,"Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago."
Michael,"So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on."
Darryl,We're loading at one.
Michael,"Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me."
Darryl,"No, we got a truck going out at 1"
Michael,"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way."
Darryl,"All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock."
Michael,"All right, see you at one."
Michael,Are we ready for the game?
Everybody,Yeah.
Michael,"I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings."
Dwight,Gimli.
Michael,Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
Dwight,Just trying to be helpful.
Michael,"Uh, ""I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."""
Jim,That's him.
Michael,"OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course."
Stanley,I'm sorry?
Michael,"Um, what do you play? Center?"
Stanley,"Why ""of course""?"
Michael,Uh...
Stanley,What's that supposed to mean?
Michael,"Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that."
Jim,"Uh, I heard it."
Michael,"Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time."
Phyllis,I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Michael,"Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart."
Ryan,"But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?"
Michael,Yes.
Ryan,OK.
Michael,"Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?"
Oscar,"I can help out, if you need me."
Michael,"I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
Kevin,I have a hoop in my driveway.
Michael,No.
Phyllis,I have a sports bra.
Michael,"No, no, ridiculous."
Dwight,"Michael, look. Missed it..."
Michael,"Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight."
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,Sorry Phyllis.
Dwight,Can I be team captain?
Michael,"No, I'm team captain."
Dwight,Can I be team manager?
Michael,"No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager."
Dwight,Assistant team manager?
Michael,No.
Dwight,"OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then."
Michael,"Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now."
Jim,Oh my God.
Michael,Threat neutralized.
Michael,Off the backboard!
Pam,Please don't throw garbage at me.
Michael,"Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?"
Pam,"I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance."
Jim,"I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and..."
Michael,"Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying."
Pam,Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Michael,"Oh, yeah right."
Phyllis,I'll do it.
Michael,"Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good."
Michael,"Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?"
Darryl,Just getting a tea bag.
Michael,"Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!"
Darryl,Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
Michael,"Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday."
Darryl,"No, that's not as much fun. You know what?"
Michael,What?
Darryl,You're on.
Michael,"OK. Cool, you're on. Don't screw this up."
Michael,"Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game."
Angela,"Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you."
Jim,"Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here."
Jim,You coming down?
Pam,"Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones."
Jim,You gonna wish me luck?
Pam,"Yeah, you're gonna need it."
Jim,Whoa.
Jim,Is that trash talk from Pam?
Pam,"I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive."
Jim,Oh.
Pam,And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
Jim,"Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along."
Pam,"Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake."
Jim,I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Michael,"Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it."
Jim,Have a good game man.
Roy,"Yeah, you too. Should be fun."
Michael,"All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?"
Ryan,I stretched before I came.
Michael,OK.
Michael,"OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy."
Jim,Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
Michael,"Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys."
Dwight,"OK, we'll be skins!"
Michael,"Aw, come on Dwight."
Dwight,What? Shirts on or off?
Michael,On. Just put it on.
Dwight,You sure?
Michael,"Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?"
Roy,"Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car."
Michael,Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! Oh... Here we go! Who's on him? Somebody get him!
Teammates,Yeah!
Roy,That's what I'm talking about.
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. Here we go. Three! Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!"
Dwight,De-fense! De-fense!
Michael and Dwight,De-fense! De-fense!
Warehouse worker,Well done team.
Michael,Who's got Roy?
Pam,Woo!
Michael,"Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go."
Michael,"OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul."
Roy,OK.
Michael,"OK, I'll take it. OK."
Michael,"When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone."
Michael,What is wrong with me today?!
Michael,"Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually."
Michael,"Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! Whoa!"
Jim,My bad.
Darryl,Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
Lonny,Where you at? Where you at? You over there? I'm over there.
Michael,That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
Michael,Nice! Come here!
Ryan,"Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine."
Darryl,You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
Roy,"All right, let's go."
Warehouse worker,Watch your back Madge.
Madge,Hey! Come on man!
Michael,"Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!"
Dwight,Yeah! In your face!
Madge,"Yeah, like that counts."
Michael,"You know what? Dwight, Dwight..."
Michael,"Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah..."
Michael,"Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter..."
Roy,Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
Michael,"All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!"
Michael,What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Jim,You know what? Let me take Roy.
Michael,"All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on."
Michael,"Shoot, shoot it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up."
Darryl,"Block, block, block!"
Madge,He's afraid of you now.
Michael,"Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?"
Michael,Yes!
Roy,What the hell man?
Jim,Take it easy.
Roy,"No, you take it easy."
Michael,"Watch the long passes, you guys!"
Ryan,"Same team, Dwight."
Michael,Dwight!
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?"
Angela,You're ahead.
Michael,"Yeah, baby, here we go!"
Michael,Jim! Jim! Right here! Ow! God! Hold it!
Worker,I'm sorry.
Michael,Foul! Foul!
Worker,I'm sorry. You all right?
Michael,"Oh, that hurts."
Worker,"Sorry, I didn't mean to do that."
Michael,"What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?"
Darryl,Take your shot man!
Michael,"No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there."
Worker,No it wasn't.
Michael,"Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair."
Worker,"Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up..."
Michael,"Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly."
Angela,This is a cold pack...
Dwight,"Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag."
Michael,Thanks Dwight.
Lonny,"Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? What's going on?"
Michael,"Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won."
Darryl,That was you.
Michael,"It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face."
Roy,"No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday."
Darryl,"Yeah, this isn't happening."
Michael,"Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so..."
Lonny,"So what's that? We're coming in on Monday, right?"
Michael,"Hey, hey..."
Lonny,Monday?
Michael,"You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word."
Jim,"...so I talked to the scout, it looks good."
Pam,Mmm-hmm.
Jim,I didn't sign anything.
Roy,Hey baby.
Pam,Hey.
Roy,Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
Pam,"Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? Let's get you into a tub."
Roy,Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
Michael,"Hey, what a game, huh? What a game."
Oscar,What time do we have to come in?
Michael,"Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend."
Michael,The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.
Jan,Are you listening to me Michael?
Roy,"Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding."
Michael,Affirmative.
Pam,"Stop, I can't breathe."
Jan,What did I just say?
Roy,I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
Michael,"You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said..."
Pam,Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Jan,Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
Katy,You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Michael,"Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!"
Angela,I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
Jan,I'm not going to do that Michael.
Katy,"Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality."
Michael,Okay
Angela,"Yeah, uh no."
Jan,We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
Dwight,"Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?"
Michael,"Uh, huh."
Katy,I don't think so I'm really busy.
Jan,At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Dwight,It will just take a second.
Michael,"Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?"
Katy,I can't.
Jan,"Uh, yes. Yes you can."
Dwight,Just for a minute.
Michael,"Um, question"
Katy,I really can't.
Jan,"No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize."
Dwight,Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Michael,I didn't mean me!
Katy,No.
Michael,"Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else."
Dwight,"Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?"
Dwight,s*x.
Katy,Both.
Michael,It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.
Dwight,Torture.
Katy,What colors do you like?
Michael,"Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid."
Angela,Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
Pam,"Uh, Michael?"
Michael,Ryan.
Michael,Pam!
Ryan,Yeah.
Pam,"Hey, there's a..."
Michael,Would you like to help me with a special project?
Michael,Burger with cheese!
Ryan,I would love to.
Pam,There's a person here...
Michael,Alright.
Michael,And fries!
Michael,"Okay, just throw out all the empties."
Pam,There's...
Ryan,You don't want to recycle them?
Michael,And shake! What? Go ahead.
Michael,"Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin."
Pam,There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
Ryan,Do you want this?
Michael,"No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction."
Michael,No.
Pam,"Okay, I told her you'd talk to her."
Ryan,What about this bottle of power drink?
Michael,"Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away."
Michael,"Uh, what flavor?"
Pam,Okay.
Ryan,Blue.
Michael,"Oooh, alright I'll talk to her."
Michael,Blue's not a flavor.
Katy,This one is hand embroidered.
Ryan,It says flavor
Michael,"All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse."
Michael,"Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you."
Dwight,Cocks in the henhouse.
Jim,Hi.
Michael,"Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?"
Katy,Hi.
Katy,Katy.
Jim,"I'm Jim, by the way."
Michael,"Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
Katy,I'm Katy.
Jim,"Hi Katy, nice to meet you."
Michael,"Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace."
Katy,"You sit out there, don't you?"
Dwight,So am I.
Jim,"I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses."
Michael,Nobody cares what you think.
Katy,"Okay, um..."
Dwight,Doesn't matter.
Jim,"Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn."
Michael,"So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day."
Katy,Okay.
Katy,"Wow, thanks."
Jim,"Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can..."
Pam,There's an HR meeting in there at 11
Katy,Okay.
Michael,"Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman."
Michael,"What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir."
Michael,"I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating."
Ryan,"No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept."
Michael,"This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be."
Michael,"No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it."
Ryan,"Well, it's empty."
Michael,"So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here."
Michael,"Not it's not, there's some in the straw. There, now you may throw it out."
Katy,I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Ryan,Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
Michael,"Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks."
Michael,"That's over several months, Ryan."
Katy,What?
Ryan,Still.
Michael,"It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here."
Jim,What's up?
Katy,Regular coffee is fine.
Pam,I'm bored.
Michael,"Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb"
Jim,Thank you for choosing me.
Katy,No really it is.
Pam,"No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?"
Michael,"No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?"
Jim,"Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy."
Katy,Bring it on.
Pam,Really?
Michael,"Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right."
Jim,Yeah.
Kevin,So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
Pam,What are you guys going to do?
Pam,No.
Jim,"Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos."
Kevin,She's prettier than you though.
Pam,That's great.
Pam,"That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin."
Jim,And stuff... yeah.
Kevin,
Pam,That's cool.
Katy,So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
Jim,What are you doing?
Dwight,"The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
Pam,"I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move."
Michael,There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
Jim,Okay.
Katy,Thank you.
Pam,'Cause Roy's got a truck.
Michael,"I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?"
Jim,That's cool.
Katy,"Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um..."
Pam,"Uh, huh. Yes."
Michael,"Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?"
Jim,"That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?"
Ryan,I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Pam,Great.
Michael,"Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?"
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy."
Pam,"Okay, I'm gonna head back."
Oscar,I'm on the phone.
Jim,Alright.
Michael,Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
Michael,"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know."
Katy,That was on Sesame Street.
Michael,Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
Michael,I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
Katy,"Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you."
Katy,"No, I don't believe that."
Michael,"See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim."
Michael,"I know, it's unbelievable."
Jim,"Goodnight, Michael."
Pam,"It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with."
Michael,Where you going?
Michael,"Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby."
Jim,"I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?"
Katy,Hi
Michael,With us?
Toby,"Hi, nice to meet you."
Katy,"I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook."
Michael,"Toby, Katy."
Michael,"Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool."
Toby,"Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?"
Jim,I got this.
Katy,Yeah.
Michael,"Alright, have fun."
Toby,"Yeah, me too."
Katy,Thanks.
Katy,Cool. What year were you there?
Jim,I got it.
Toby,Eighty-nine.
Michael,Don't drink and drive.
Michael,"Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?"
Michael,Take it easy.
Toby,Yeah.
Jim,Have a good night.
Michael,"You and your wife, and you have kids."
Michael,"You too, have a good night."
Toby,A girl.
Katy,You got that?
Michael,Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
Jim,"Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter."
Toby,
Katy,Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Katy,I should probably get back to my table.
Jim,"Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?"
Michael,"Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work."
Katy,Why?
Michael,"I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule"
Jim,"This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay."
Roy,"Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?"
Katy,It's a... it's a very nice car.
Jim,"Cute, sure, yeah."
Jim,You're not going to freak out?
Roy,Why don't you get on that?
Michael,"Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning."
Jim,She's not really my type.
Roy,What are you gay?
Jim,"Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope."
Kevin,What is your type?
Jim,"Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really."
Roy,That's disgusting.
Kevin,Stay away from my mom.
Jim,"Too late, Kev."
Roy,"Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam."
Pam,"We're not dating, we're engaged."
Roy,"Engaged, yeah."
Jim,"Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems."
Jim,She'd be perfect for you.
Dwight,Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
Jim,"So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager."
Dwight,Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Jim,"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss."
Dwight,That's true.
Jim,"Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there."
Dwight,True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
Jim,It's all gold.
Katy,"Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions."
Jim,"Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back."
Dwight,What's that?
Jim,You buy a purse.
Dwight,I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Jim,"Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?"
Dwight,No.
Jim,"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them."
Dwight,Like those?
Jim,"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her."
Dwight,"Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going..."
Jim,No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
Jim,"Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good."
Pam,
Jim,"Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?"
Pam,"Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
Jim,"Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens."
Pam,Oh!
Jim,Oh! That was really. This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
Pam,Oh...
Jim,"I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?"
Pam,"Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad."
Jim,"Here he comes, shhh..."
Jim,Good.
Pam,
Jim,He did pick a good one.
Pam,You're horrible.
Katy,This one's really good for a hot date.
Pam,"Yeah, what's that?"
Katy,
Pam,I'm engaged. So...
Katy,Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.
Pam,"I wished, right?"
Michael,"Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?"
Katy,Good.
Michael,"Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?"
Katy,Sorry.
Michael,Busted.
Katy,Come back...
Michael,"Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones."
Katy,Is that from Starbucks?
Michael,Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
Katy,Wow. Is that for the office?
Michael,"Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!"
Katy,I wouldn't think of it.
Michael,"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!"
Michael,"Oh the rotating um, steam wand. What? What's the matter?"
Katy,"Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me."
Michael,"Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?"
Katy,"Oh no, it's um..."
Michael,Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
Katy,No...
Michael,"Seriously. No, really."
Katy,No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
Michael,"God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp."
Katy,At five?
Michael,"I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves."
Katy,Okay.
Michael,What?
Katy,"Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay."
Michael,Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
Katy,Okay. Cool.
Michael,Excellent.
Katy,Cool.
Michael,"Great. Cool. Cool. Yeah, okay."
Michael,I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
Dwight,It's actually better this way.
Michael,No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
Dwight,Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
Michael,"No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not."
Dwight,"Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much."
Michael,But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
Dwight,What?
Michael,She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
Dwight,Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Michael,"Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot..."
Dwight,"Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?"
Michael,No. I cannot promise you that.
Dwight,"You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?"
Michael,"Listen, Dwight."
Dwight,Do you love her?
Michael,"Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel."
Katy,"I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that."
Stanley,Hmmm...
Michael,Espresso?
Katy,"Oh, thank you."
Michael,You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
Stanley,Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Michael,Ummm-hmmm...
Stanley,I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Michael,Very easy to clean.
Michael,"Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right?"
Michael,Did we get any mail?
Pam,"Yeah, I gave it to you."
Michael,"Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and..."
Pam,"So, can I..?"
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
Jim,A futon?
Pam,
Jim,He's a grown man
Pam,That's what he said.
Jim,"That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one."
Roy,What's up?
Pam,Hi.
Roy,Are you still mad at me?
Pam,Roy...
Roy,Come on
Pam,Cut it out.
Roy,"Come on, you mad at me?"
Pam,Stop it.
Roy,Are you still mad at me now?
Pam,Cut it out.
Roy,Are you mad at me now?
Pam,Stop.
Michael,"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, ""Hey, did you get an award?"" And the neighbor will say, ""No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me."" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So..."
Jim,What a great year for the Dundies.
Jim,"So, you ready for the... the Dundies?"
Jim,"We got to see Ping. And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. Which for me, has ruined them for life."
Pam,Ugh...
Pam,"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you."
Jim,What?
Michael,Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
Pam,Nothing.
Jim,What?
Jim,Okay.
Michael,Fat Halpert. Jim Halpert.
Pam,What?
Michael,"So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?"
Jim,"I don't know, what?"
Jim,"Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky."
Michael,"Oh, that's a good idea."
Jim,Oh my God! You are so drunk!
Dwight,Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
Jim,Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
Michael,Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
Dwight,"Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy."
Michael,"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say ""Don't go there"" but that's... lame."
Jim,He's a volunteer.
Michael,"And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling."
Dwight,Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Stanley,"I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out."
Jim,"Dwight come on, come-"
Michael,"Oh, no you di-int."
Dwight,"It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt."
Stanley,I think I did.
Michael,W-why did you...
Pam,"Dwight, get off me!"
Stanley,"Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?"
Michael,"Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, someone had eaten all of them."
Employee,"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat."
Michael,"To Oscar Martinez it's the ""Show Me the Money"" award! Yeah!"
Dwight,Ahh! I can't-
Pam,"Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights."
Michael,"Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost."
Oscar,That's supposed to be confidential.
Pam,Oh my God!
Michael,"He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!"
Jim,Whoa.
Pam,"I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!"
Michael,"A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing..."
Jim,Whoa.
Jim,"Whoa, careful, careful."
Michael,...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Chili's Employee,"We have a strict policy here not to over serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again."
Pam,"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
Michael,Great work tonight.
Michael,"...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of..."
Dwight,Watch your step.
Kelly,It was you.
Michael,Excellent.
Phyllis,Live and learn.
Dwight,"Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion."
Pam,It wasn't. I swear.
Michael,"Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work."
Kelly,"Yeah, it was."
Pam,I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Dwight,"So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either."
Jim,No you don't.
Pam,"We're not laughing at you, Dwight."
Jim,"Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there."
Dwight,So who are we laughing at?
Pam,"Hey, um, can I ask you a question?"
Pam,"Um, just something somebody wrote."
Jim,Shoot.
Dwight,Who? Dave Barry?
Kelly,"No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall."
Pam,"Um, I just wanted to say thanks."
Dwight,What is it? Who wrote it?
Jim,"Not really a question. Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk."
Pam,"Um, it's kind of private."
Phyllis,It's about Michael.
Jim,Alright.
Dwight,"That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less."
Pam,Bye.
Pam,"Okay, now I'm laughing at you."
Jim,"Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela."
Michael,"Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?"
Jan,"It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael."
Michael,"Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home."
Jan,No.
Michael,"Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So..."
Jan,"No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this."
Michael,Um...
Michael,Could you...?
Jan,Are you there Michael?
Michael,"Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that."
Michael,"Um, what, ah, what is, I mean..."
Michael,"...come on, Jan!"
Michael,You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
Jan,Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Michael,"Well, yeah, I mean, what is..."
Jan,You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Michael,No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
Jan,And you had a luau....
Michael,...it happens once every billion years.
Jan,And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Michael,"Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N."
Jan,"Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense."
Michael,"Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage."
Michael,"This is a little character I like to do, it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. ""Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."" Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
Phyllis,"Dwight, get out of here!!"
Dwight,"No, no, no, no..."
Phyllis,What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Dwight,"...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think."
Phyllis,Why were you peering over the stalls?!
Dwight,"No, why were you in there?!"
Phyllis,You are a pervert!
Dwight,What were you doing in there?
Phyllis,"You, are, a pervert!"
Dwight,I am not.
Michael,"The Dundie award for ""Longest Engagement"" goes to Pam Beesley."
Michael,"Pam, everybody!"
Michael,"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting."
Roy,Yes.
Michael,"Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?"
Roy,"Ah, w-we'll see you next year."
Michael,"Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!"
Michael,"I'm not changing that, it's the best one."
Jim,"No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, ""world's longest engagement"", um, we're all expecting it, you know?"
Michael,"That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier."
Jim,Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Michael,"Oh, lazy. Uh huh."
Dwight,"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom."
Pam,You're taking away our bathroom?
Dwight,We are going to have two men's rooms.
Phyllis,But where would we...go?
Dwight,Be prepared to hold folks From 9 am to...
Pam,Michael...
Michael,Yes.
Pam,...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
Michael,"Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now."
Dwight,"Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions..."
Michael,"Just don't, don't talk-"
Dwight,...for people's behavior.
Michael,Don't talk-
Dwight,And it's-
Michael,Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
Michael,"Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us."
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,"Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever."
Dwight,Best Dundies ever.
Dwight,Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
Dwight,"Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. Devon!"
Michael,"""The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello."" Card!"
Oscar,"The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like."
Michael,"""You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"""
Dwight,The waitress tripped on the cord.
Michael,"Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
Kevin,"Oh, just put these on the group tab."
Michael,"Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks."
Stanley,"You said, we could bring our families."
Michael,I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
Stanley,"I did, my wife's name is Terri."
Michael,"Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri."
Stanley,It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
Michael,"Shut it. Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight."
Dwight,Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Michael,"No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy."
Dwight,Yeah?
Michael,And I was about to take her bra off...
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
Dwight,Like an AIDS test?
Michael,No! God.
Michael,"Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted."
Darryl,Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
Roy,"Yeah, let's get out of here."
Pam,Um...
Michael,"Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started."
Pam,Sorry.

Jim,"Yeah, gotta eat somewhere."
Michael,"And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts..."
Michael,"...the ""Busiest Beaver"" award goes to Phyllis Lapin."
Michael,"Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual."
Phyllis,"This says ""Bushiest Beaver""."
Michael,What? I told them busiest...idiots.
Phyllis,"It's, it's fine."
Michael,"Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that."
Pam,...because that's what happens every time!
Roy,...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
Pam,No.
Roy,"Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's."
Pam,"No, I don't want to go, I don't want to."
Roy,Pam. Go.
Pam,"If you would have asked me that, then you would know."
Michael,Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
Jim,Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
Pam,"Oh no, I just, I decided to stay."
Jim,Oh!
Pam,I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
Jim,Oh.
Pam,"Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping."
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny."
Michael,Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
Pam,Can I get a drink?
Michael,"This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office."
Michael,"Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The ""Hottest in the Office"" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!"
Michael,"Yeah. ""Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you."" Here you go."
Ryan,What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
Michael,"And the ""Tight Ass"" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down."
Angela,No.
Jim,I think those might be empty.
Pam,"No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
Jim,Second drink?
Michael,"The ""Spicy Curry"" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go."
Kelly,"""Spicy Curry"", what's that mean?"
Michael,"Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke."
Kelly,"Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?"
Michael,"I don't know, it's just..."
Kelly,This is a bowler-
Michael,I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
Kelly,"Yeah, but everyone else-"
Michael,Just sit down Kelly.
Michael,"It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go."
Michael,"""You have won a tiny Dundie."""
Guy at bar,Sing it Elton.
Michael,"Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?"
Other Guy at Bar,We just came from yo' mama's house.
Michael,"Oh, alright, yeah."
Guy At Bar,Sing 'em a song dude.
Michael,"Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh..."
Michael,"Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-"
Guy At Bar,You suck man!
Michael,Let's cut it.
Michael,"I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the ""Don't Go in There After Me"" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So..."
Michael,There you go.
Pam,Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Jim,"Yeah, alright Kev."
Pam,"Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet!"
Jim,"Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going."
Pam,More Dundies!
Pam and Jim,Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies!
Everybody,Dundies! Dundies!
Michael,"Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year."
Pam,Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
Michael,You know you did.
Pam,"Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech"
Stanley,"Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't..."
Stanley,"So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin."
Michael,And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
Michael,...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
Michael,"It is the ""Whitest Sneakers"" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!"
Michael,"Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! Oh, here we go."
Pam,I have so many people to thank for this award.
Pam,"Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too."
Pam,"Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie."
Pam,"And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!"
Michael,Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. Oh! Thank you.
Michael,"Hey, what's up?"
Pam,"Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time."
Jim,Hey.
Pam's Mom,"Oh, I don't believe that."
Michael,Any emails today?
Roy,"Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?"
Jim,Um... I don't think so.
Pam's Mom,"Oh, anything is fine."
Michael,No? Um... Check your spam folder.
Roy,"All right, I'll see ya."
Jim,Oh! There it is!
Pam's Mom,So which one is Jim?
Michael,What?
Pam,Mom!
Jim,Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Pam's Mom,I just wanted to know.
Michael,
Pam,No.
Jim,Well done.
Pam's Mom,All right. Okay.
Michael,Kay.
Pam,Ten minutes.
Jim,Topical.
Pam's Mom,Okay.
Michael,"I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer."
Pam,Then we can go to dinner.
Dwight,So the monkey does the s*x thing right here!
Pam's Mom,I'll make myself busy.
Michael,That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
Todd Packer,"There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh..."
Dwight,Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Kevin,Phyllis?
Michael,"Um, I..."
Michael,"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line."
Dwight,Consider it?
Todd Packer,Ex-squeeze me?
Michael,"Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... Whup! Come on! Hey!"
Michael,"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin."
Todd Packer,What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? This guy!
Kevin,Packer said it.
Michael,"Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!"
Michael,"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother."
Todd Packer,
Phyllis,"I'm the same age as you, Michael."
Michael,"Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him."
Michael,I don't know about that.
Todd Packer,"bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?"
Phyllis,We're in the same High School class.
Michael,Uh oh.
Michael,"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner."
Todd Packer,Still queer?
Kevin,You mean where my desk is?
Michael,Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
Michael,"Yes, your corner. Go."
Michael,"Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So..."
Kevin,Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Michael,"Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why."
Michael,Mmmhmmm.
Todd Packer,"Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent."
Todd Packer,"Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?"
Michael,Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Michael,"They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on."
Todd Packer,We're talking blonde incompetent.
Phyllis,Michael! Come on!
Michael,"Oh, yeah."
Michael,Oooh!
Todd Packer,Like 10 words a minute... talking.
Phyllis,You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Michael,"Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there."
Michael,I'm not worried.
Todd Packer,"They are women, right?"
Phyllis,...report you to HR.
Michael,Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
Michael,"You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody."
Todd Packer,"I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch."
Michael,"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to."
Michael,"Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button."
Pam,He said what?
Jim,"Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? This guy!"
Todd Packer,"Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?"
Michael,Oh. Bad boy. Um... Ryan?
Todd Packer,"Come on, kid. Let's go."
Michael,Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Jim,Except pass that breathalyzer.
Ryan,You a big William Hung fan?
Todd Packer,Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
Kevin's computer,
Jim,I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Pam,You are?
Pam,My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Pam,I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Jim,Oh yeah?
Pam,mmhmm.
Jim,Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Pam,Oh really?
Jim,"Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?"
Michael,"Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot."
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,"Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. ""Old School""."
Toby,Michael?
Michael,"Yes, Toby?"
Toby,Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Michael,Um... literally two seconds?
Michael,Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
Toby,The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
Michael,"No, no, Toby. No."
Toby,"It's really not a big deal, Michael."
Michael,"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!"
Toby,And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
Michael,What?
Toby,Just to refresh you... .
Michael,NO!
Toby,on our policy.
Michael,"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?"
Toby,Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Michael,There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
Michael,"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So, take it away."
Toby,"Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later."
Michael,"I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it."
Michael,"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake."
Michael,"Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?"
Darryl,Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Michael,"Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day."
Darryl,"Well, those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?"
Roy,Boys R Us!
Warehouse Guy,Oh!
Michael,"Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense."
Darryl,"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with."
Michael,"Oooh, okay. That was still about me."
Roy,"Hey, hey, hey."
Michael,What?
Roy,So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
Michael,I don't feel bad.
Darryl,I think he feels bad.
Michael,"No, I don't."
Roy,You look like you feel bad.
Michael,Okay.
Roy,Little package!
Michael,"Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys."
Warehouse guy,Little package! Little package!
Michael,Thank you.
Roy,You look good.
Darryl,Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse guys,
Toby,"So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?"
Pam,"Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today."
Kevin,MILF!
Pam,"Thanks, Kevin."
Pam,Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Pam,She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Toby,Great point.
Pam,Thank you.
Toby,"Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back."
Michael,"Hi, is it over?"
Toby,"Uh, yes!"
Michael,No.
Toby,I can go over it with you.
Michael,"I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over."
Toby,It's over.
Michael,"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?"
Angela,Email forwards.
Michael,Exactly! Mmwwah! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Angela,I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Michael,"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?"
Stanley,That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Meredith,Um... what about office romance?
Toby,"Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR."
Phyllis,"All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?"
Michael,"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have."
Dwight,"Yeah, Meredith."
Michael,No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,She would have definitely slept with me.
Kevin,She wasn't that hot.
Michael,"Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!"
Toby,"Ok, you know, Michael..."
Jim,"I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it."
Michael,"What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work? Would that be crossing the line?"
Toby,No.
Michael,What if they made out? In front of everybody?
Toby,"Well, that would be..."
Michael,At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Toby,"Okay, I'm lost."
Michael,"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?"
Video,[Crossing the Line
Michael,"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?"
Jim,"No, thanks. I'm good."
Michael,That's what she said. Pam?
Pam,Uh... my mother's coming.
Michael,"That's what she sai Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself."
Dwight,"Hey, Toby."
Toby,Hey Dwight.
Dwight,You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Toby,Sure.
Dwight,"Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?"
Toby,"Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly."
Toby,"Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that."
Dwight,Good. Good. And...
Toby,I should get back to work.
Dwight,Okay.
Man in Video,"In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'"
Video,
Roy,Natural redhead.
Actor,"Hey, Rach."
Redheaded Actress,"Hey, Joe. Mike."
Actor,"Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?"
Darryl,"Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. This is..."
Roy,That's her?
Darryl,"Yes, this is the one."
Roy,No!
Darryl,You remember? Yes!
Roy,At the party?
Warehouse guy,You banged her?
Darryl,Yes! Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Michael,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay."
Jan,"Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. Hi."
Michael,"Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure."
Todd Packer,"Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour."
Pam,"I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks."
Todd Packer,Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
Michael,"So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes."
Mr. O'Malley,I love lawyer jokes.
Michael,"Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em."
Michael,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another."
Jan,"You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?"
Michael,The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Jan,"Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything."
Michael,"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan."
Jan,"Do you need to see the video again, Michael?"
Michael,"No, I've seen the video."
Toby,He talked the whole time.
Michael,"No, I didn't. Huh, what?"
Michael,"Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things."
Jim,Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Michael,Mmmhmm. Yes.
Jim,"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so..."
Michael,THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Jan,Michael. MICHAEL!
Michael,Come on.
Jan,"Michael, please."
Todd Packer,There he is.
Michael,Mwah!
Todd Packer,There he is. Good one.
Michael,You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
Jan,Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
Michael,It's... That's...
Jan,That's not my sense of humor.
Michael,"Okay. Hello. Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny."
Jan,Wha...
Michael,I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny,"And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits."
Michael,This guy does it all.
Jan,"'Scuse me, I'm sorry. Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer."
Michael,What?
Jan,"Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself."
Michael,So I'm not in trouble?
Michael,"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems."
Michael,"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so..."
Albiny,"Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here."
Michael,I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
Pam's Mom,Um... hello.
Pam,Oh my god!
Pam's Mom,Finally made it!
Pam,Hello!
Pam,I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Pam's Mom,This is all yours?
Pam,Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
Pam's Mom,"Oh, my goodness. That's great."
Todd Packer,"So a guy goes home, tells his wife, ""Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery."" She goes, ""Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?"" He goes, ""I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!"" Boom!"
Pam,This is where I used to keep my computer.
Pam's Mom,"Oh, right! I remember..."
Pam,But then I moved it.
Pam's Mom,with the picture.
Pam,"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So..."
Pam's Mom,Sure.
Pam,"So this is like, um, an organization station..."
Pam's Mom,Oooooh!
Pam,Hey!
Pam's Mom,"Well, there he is!"
Roy,How are ya?
Pam's Mom,"Hi, handsome!"
Roy,You look great!
Pam's Mom,"Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?"
Michael,"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast."
Jim,Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1
Ryan,"I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit."
Stanley,Oscar!
Michael,"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan."
Crowd,Go! Go! Go!
Ryan,"What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?"
Jim,"Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. Guys?"
Michael,"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. ""Home Alone,"" ""Risky Business."" Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do."
Dwight,What is going on?
Ryan,I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Jim,Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
Michael,Ok. Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
Dwight,That's my stopwatch.
Michael,"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate."
Jim,Here you go. All done.
Dwight,Diversifying. Smart.
Oscar,Great.
Michael,"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you."
Jim,"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so."
Dwight,"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers."
Ryan,"I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?"
Michael,Maybe.
Jim,Hey.
Jim,
Pam,I have 59 voicemails.
Pam,
Jim,"Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?"
Pam,"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him."
Pam,Sure.
Pam,You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Jim,"Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies."
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Pam,Really?
Pam,"Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it."
Jim,Notify the athletes.
Jim,No way. Let's do this Oh.
Pam,Cool.
Pam,Here.
Jim,Michael.
Jim,Wind.
Michael,Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
Pam,Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Jim,Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Jim,Perfect.
Michael,"Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly."
Pam,Oh.
Jim,Nice.
Jim,Oh.
Michael,You know.
Dwight,You should go.
Jim,"Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you."
Michael,Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
Michael,Really?
Dwight,Uh huh.
Michael,What's this?
Michael,Sign the papers at the condo.
Jim,"These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal."
Dwight,You have your lawyer there?
Michael,"I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment."
Michael,"Uh, I don't need one."
Jim,"And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal."
Dwight,Can I be your representative?
Michael,"Get up here, Dwight."
Michael,I don't need a representative.
Dwight,Silver medal.
Dwight,I think I should be there.
Michael,"Yep, not as good as gold. Why are you playing the national anthem?"
Michael,"No, No."
Jim,Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
Dwight,I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Michael,Oh. What the hell is that?
Michael,No. Dwight. I'm fine.
Jim,Those are the doves.
Dwight,"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work."
Michael,"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal."
Dwight,So you're taking a personal day?
Michael,"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work."
Dwight,"Please, I'll make you proud."
Michael,"Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come."
Dwight,Yes! As your representative?
Michael,As my associate.
Dwight,Same thing.
Michael,No it is not.
Dwight,"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart"
Michael,"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
Pam,You headed out?
Michael,We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
Pam,Ok.
Michael,Very good.
Pam,Have a great time.
Michael,"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?"
Pam,"Yeah, I changed them to your new address."
Michael,Good. The Small Business Man?
Pam,Yup.
Michael,Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
Pam,"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription."
Michael,"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?"
Pam,
Michael,"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,Ok. See you soon.
Dwight,What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
Michael,"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?"
Dwight,I want to put the top down.
Michael,"What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please..."
Dwight,But then no one can see us.
Michael,I... Just... Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
Dwight,Check it out. Terminator.
Michael,I do not understand what you spend your money on.
Kevin,Ooh.
Jim,"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?"
Oscar,"Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know."
Jim,What does 2005 season mean?
Oscar,Eh.
Jim,"Wait a minute, what is this?"
Oscar,It's a scoreboard.
Jim,What?
Oscar,Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
Jim,Really?
Oscar,Yeah.
Kevin,Or when we're bored.
Jim,"Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years."
Kevin,We're bored a lot.
Jim,OH!
Kevin,Oh!
Oscar,Sweet!
Jim,Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.
Kevin,We call it Hate Ball.
Jim,Why?
Kevin,Because of how much Angela hates it.
Jim,"Hey, do you guys have any other games?"
Kevin,"Sometimes we play ""Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?"""
Angela,You play that.
Oscar,You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
Michael,"Home, sweet home."
Dwight,Which one's yours?
Michael,"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home."
Jim,So that's what this sound is all day.
Carol,"Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association."
Michael,"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something."
Bill,Nice to meet you.
Michael,Nice to meet you too.
Dwight,This is smaller than your old place.
Michael,"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um."
Dwight,"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x."
Carol,Are we ready to sign some papers?
Dwight,"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood."
Bill,"It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles."
Carol,It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
Michael,Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
Dwight,Let's go check out the master bedroom.
Jim,"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?"
Stanley,"Yeah, I got a game. It's called ""work hard so my kids can go to college."""
Jim,Fair enough.
Michael,"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall."
Dwight,Oh. Terrible idea.
Michael,I'm putting my bed right over here.
Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed."
Michael,"Well, then I will get a warrantee."
Dwight,"Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off."
Michael,Well then I won't get a warrantee.
Dwight,Shh Shh.
Michael,"So that's the problem, is solved. What?"
Dwight,Listen. Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
Jim,This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
Kevin,It smells like cookies.
Jim,"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids."
Pam,"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system."
Angela,I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
Jim,Let the games begin.
Carol,"And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow."
Dwight,What kind of mortgage did you get?
Michael,Uh... Ten year.
Carol,"Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total."
Michael,What? Wha? You said ten.
Carol,"Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total."
Dwight,"Ho, thirty years."
Michael,"Ok, ok, ok."
Dwight,"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies."
Michael,Alright.
Dwight,"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live."
Michael,Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
Dwight,"Well, this is it."
Carol,Whenever you're ready.
Michael,"Um. Oh. Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?"
Carol,Actually yes.
Dwight,"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
Michael,Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
Dwight,We'll be here waiting for you.
Michael,"Oh, man."
Dwight,"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
Carol,"Whenever you're ready, Michael."
Michael,Uh.
Jim,"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?"
Pam,"Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
Jim,Hum.
Pam,"In English, box of paper snowshoe racing."
Jim,"Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton."
Pam,"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens."
Jim,"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?"
Phyllis,I'll do it.
Jim,"Yes! Phyllis! Phyllis, just put your foot right through here. Right through the flonk."
Michael,"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't..."
Carol,What?
Michael,...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
Carol,"Michael, this is the unit you saw and..."
Michael,Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
Carol,Who told you that?
Michael,"As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here."
Michael,"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down."
Carol,"Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom."
Michael,"No, no, no."
Carol,That's some extra income for you.
Michael,I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
Carol,"You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now."
Michael,Ehhhh....
Michael,I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
Dwight,Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
Jim,Here we go. Here we go.
Pam,Go! Go! Go!
Oscar,Pair of shoes!
Jim,"Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!"
Pam,It's Phyllis!
Jim,Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Pam,Flonkerton.
Jim,"Thank you, delegate from Iceland."
Meredith,Wow!
Kevin,
Jim,Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
Michael,"There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today."
Dwight,You didn't have to...
Michael,"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent."
Michael,"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities."
Dwight,I don't even know what to say.
Michael,"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone."
Dwight,Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
Michael,What the hell is a terrarium?
Dwight,It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Michael,"Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place."
Dwight,Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
Pam,Are you sure you don't want to play?
Angela,I'm sure.
Pam,"Come on Angela, don't you have a game?"
Angela,"I have one, yes."
Pam,"Well, let's play, what is it?"
Angela,I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
Pam,We're friends.
Angela,Apparently.
Jim,"Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis."
Phyllis,Are you calling me a ho?
Jim,"Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it."
Dwight,"Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?"
Michael,We take separate cars.
Dwight,Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Michael,Why would we do that?
Dwight,Just for fun?
Michael,No.
Dwight,Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
Michael,"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok."
Dwight,"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch."
Oscar,Ah...
Everyone,OH!
Jim,Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
Ryan,I did.
Jim,Ryan Howard. Ryan! Gold medal.
Pam,I made something for our closing ceremonies.
Jim,What? Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
Pam,Automatic voicemail.
Jim,"Alright Pam, alright. Nice work!"
Pam,
Stanley,A little bit more and I would have had it.
Dwight,You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
Michael,"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst."
Dwight,People love beets.
Michael,Nobody likes beets.
Dwight,Everybody loves beets.
Michael,"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet."
Dwight,Let's get this roof going.
Michael,Stop it!
Dwight,Ow.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second."
Meredith,...Jim.
Jim,Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
Phyllis,Definitely Jim.
Pam,"Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?"
Kelly,"Definitely, definitely, Jim."
Jim,So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Phyllis,"Come on, Pam."
Pam,Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Kelly,How about you Pam?
Jim,Okay.
Pam,Um... Oscar's kind of cute.
Michael,"Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think."
Phyllis,"Yeah, I like Oscar."
Ryan,The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Pam,"Ooh, Toby!"
Michael,"Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!"
Michael,How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Dwight,Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
Meredith,Is there anybody else.
Michael,"Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?"
Kevin,
Ryan,"Ah, well, I'm interested in business."
Jim,"Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs..."
Michael,Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Michael,"Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find."
Ryan,"Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company."
Ryan,What's your number?
Michael,That is ridiculous.
Michael,I gave it to you in the car.
Michael,Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
Ryan,Um...
Michael,Much advice you seek. Do you know who that is?
Michael,I saw you program it in.
Ryan,Fozzie bear?
Ryan,You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Michael,Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
Michael,Okay. Alright.
Michael,There are ten rules of business that you need to learn. Number one
Ryan,Now I have it.
Ryan,Got it.
Michael,"Uh, I better tell somebody. Excuse me, sir..."
Michael,And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
Dwight,
Michael,Hey!
Michael,"Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh."
Dwight,"Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto."
Dwight,"Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing."
Oscar,But it says no late fee... .
Michael,"Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school."
Dwight,People!
Dwight,That's exactly what I said.
Angela,Okay! Everybody!
Michael,"Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?"
Dwight,This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Dwight,Were you absent?
Angela,Do not panic!
Michael,Toaster Oven 101?
Dwight,Head towards the exits.
Dwight,You failed?
Angela,Safety partners.
Ryan,I am so sorry.
Dwight,Get up off your desks!
Michael,"Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans."
Angela,Do not panic.
Dwight,"I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!"
Oscar,"No, I don't hear it? Alright."
Dwight and Michael,Ryan started the fire! It was always burning---
Dwight,"No, panic is warranted!"
Dwight,Everybody!
Angela,Go in single file lines.
Michael,...since the world was turning.
Oscar,"No, no. Finish the..."
Ryan,I can't believe I started the fire.
Dwight,This is not at drill!
Dwight and Michael,
Angela,Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Dwight,... Marilyn Monroe!
Dwight,"Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!"
Dwight and Michael,Ryan started the fire! It was always burning...
Angela,"Go, let's go."
Dwight,Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Dwight,"This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!"
Katy,Hi!
Dwight,This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Jim,Hey.
Phyllis,"Oh, you say that every time."
Katy,How are you?
Dwight,DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
Jim,"Good, how are you?"
Phyllis,"Oh, boy..."
Katy,I'm good. It's good to see you.
Dwight,Do you want to die? OUT!!
Jim,"Good to see you, too."
Angela,"Alright, let's go, let's go."
Katy,I'm hungry.
Dwight,STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Jim,"Yeah, I am too."
Angela,"Come on, you're safety partners!"
Katy,"Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers."
Dwight,Move to the exits!
Jim,What answers?
Angela,You're safety partners!
Katy,"Um, for the... the desert island."
Dwight,"We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!"
Jim,"Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. Desert Island. Five movies. Go."
Kelly,I'm okay!
Katy,"Okay, um, first, Legally Blond."
Dwight,Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Pam,"I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car."
Kelly,Let go of me!
Jim,"Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?"
Dwight,"Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!"
Katy,Okay.
Michael,"Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands."
Jim,Yeah?
Michael,Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
Katy,Alright! You want to drive?
Ryan,Yeah.
Jim,Sure.
Michael,Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.
Katy,Alright.
Dwight,"Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?"
Katy,They are soo cute.
Michael,So what was rule two?
Ryan,"I'm really sorry, Dwight."
Ryan,"Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act."
Dwight,"Answer me this, though."
Michael,"Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower."
Ryan,What?
Dwight,"Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off."
Dwight,Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
Michael,"Okay, uh, well, one is taken."
Ryan,No.
Ryan,"Uh, okay, two?"
Kevin,Was it worth it?
Dwight,NO!
Dwight,Really?
Ryan,"Okay... uh, sorry?"
Ryan,"I'm really sorry, Dwight."
Dwight,"Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today."
Dwight,The fire guy! The fire guy!
Michael,"Well, he needs a permanent number, right?"
Dwight,"Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!"
Ryan,No.
Michael,"Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer."
Ryan,...I don't.
Michael,Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
Dwight,"Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers."
Michael,I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
Michael,"Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges."
Dwight,"That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers..."
Ryan,"I don't want to be like ""a guy"" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the ""crossword puzzle guy"". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the ""something guy""."
Jim,"Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?"
Stanley,Ooh.
Jim,"And, um..."
Pam,...Would You Rather?
Jim,Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
Dwight,"Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a..."
Jim,"Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela."
Angela,The Bible.
Stanley,That's one book. You've got two others.
Angela,A Purpose Driven Life.
Jim,Nice. Third book?
Angela,No.
Jim,Okay. Phyllis.
Phyllis,"Um, The DaVinci Code."
Angela,The DaVinci Code!
Jim,Nice.
Angela,I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
Dwight,"Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question"
Jim,I guess.
Dwight,"Then I would bring an axe, no books."
Jim,"Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight."
Dwight,Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
Jim,Nice. Smart.
Dwight,"...hollowed out, inside"
Michael,"Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?"
Ryan,Yeah.
Jim,Okay. Thought people read more books.
Jim,DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith?
Meredith,"Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County..."
Jim,Wow.
Pam,Legends of the Fall?
Jim,"Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... ."
Pam,"Well, I kind of liked Legal..."
Jim,"Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable."
Pam,I take it back.
Jim,Unforgivable.
Pam,I take it back!
Jim,Good.
Meredith,"...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene..."
Dwight,"Is this your car, Ryan?"
Michael,"Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?"
Ryan,Don't...
Dwight,Good shocks.
Michael,"Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for..."
Ryan,That's actually a test prep book.
Michael,...for Phone. What?
Ryan,That's a test prep for business school.
Michael,"Um, oh, thinking about business school?"
Ryan,"I just got in. I applied, I go at night."
Michael,Really?
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,So you think you know a lot about business?
Ryan,"No, not yet."
Michael,Uh huh.
Ryan,Just started.
Michael,Yeah. Quiz me.
Ryan,I... wouldn't even know where to start.
Michael,"Come on, egghead. Let's do it."
Dwight,Do it.
Michael,Quiz me up.
Ryan,"All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?"
Michael,Uh...
Michael,"When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me."
Ryan,Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
Dwight,Keep an existing...
Michael,"Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? Uh, it's equal."
Ryan,It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Michael,Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
Dwight,"Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks."
Michael,"Okay, Dwight."
Dwight,Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Michael,"You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about."
Dwight,"Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?"
Michael,"For instance, why don't you go to business..."
Dwight,"You should learn from him, right?"
Ryan,I am.
Dwight,Right?
Ryan,I am.
Michael,"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will."
Dwight,Stupid!
Michael,"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all."
Michael,Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
Ryan,It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Michael,You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
Jim,Pam? Get us back into it.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,Five movies. Go ahead.
Pam,"Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused..."
Jim,"Ooh, definitely in my top five."
Pam,"Yes. In my top three, so suck it."
Jim,What?
Pam,Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
Jim,Okay that's five.
Pam,"No, my all time favorite!"
Jim,"Pam, play by the rules."
Pam,All time favorite.
Jim,Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Dwight,The Crow.
Michael,"I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?"
Ryan,Maybe we should get some air.
Michael,"Nah, I'm okay."
Ryan,I'm really uncomfortable.
Jim,All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Kevin,Present company excluded?
Jim,"Um, not neccessari..."
Kevin,Pam.
Oscar,Pam.
Jim,"Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then..."
song,Think you've had too much / in this life.
Jim,"Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back."
Stanley,"Okay, um..."
Jim,Dwight. Dwight.
Song,"Everybody hurts,"
Jim,Come on Dwight! Use words.
Song,Sometim... .
Dwight,Why didn't I go to business school?
Jim,Who goes to business school?
Dwight,The temp.
Jim,He does?
Dwight,"Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore."
Pam,"You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'."
Dwight,He doesn't even know that I do that.
Pam,You should tell him.
Dwight,"Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted."
Pam,Dwight.
Jim,What?
Dwight,"I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway."
Jim,"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them."
Dwight,"Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins."
Jim,Yeah. You're right.
Dwight,Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
Pam,Kay.
Song,Everybody hurts
Jim,Alright buddy.
Song,Everybody cries
Roy,"Hey! Guys, what's going on?"
Jim,Nothing.
Pam,Hey!
Song,Everybody hurts
Roy,What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
Song,Sometimes
Roy,The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
Stanley,"Come on people, you know the rules of the game now."
Michael,"Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?"
Stanley,Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
Michael,"Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?"
Roy,"Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?"
Angela,My name is Angela.
Roy,"Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you."
Michael,"Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?"
Jim,"Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling."
Michael,"Well, I would definitely have s*x with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business."
Roy,You're all gay.
Michael,"Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo..."
Ryan,"Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk... this is great timing."
Michael,"Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So..."
Dwight,Would that make you happy?
Michael,What's that?
Dwight,"If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?"
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,I'm on it.
Michael,Dwight. Hey!
Angela,You can't go in yet!
Michael,"Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen."
Kevin,What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Michael,I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
Michael,"Happy Halloween, everyone! Oh... that's great!"
Devon,"Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man."
Pam,Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
Michael,"Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot."
Michael,Ohh... OK.
Devon,That's why I'm being fired?
Michael,"I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. Okay."
Michael,No.
Sherri,Jan Levinson's office.
Devon,So you might not look like an idiot?
Michael,"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning."
Michael,"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and..."
Sherri,"Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go."
Devon,This is unbelievable!
Michael,"Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day."
Michael,I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
Sherri,I just need the name of who you're planning to let go.
Michael,"Devon, wait, please."
Michael,I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
Devon,What!
Sherri,I know she wanted the name.
Michael,"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings."
Michael,Okay... Sherri?
Devon,"Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell!"
Sherri,Yeah?
Angela,What about the Halloween party?
Michael,"If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?"
Pam,"Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out."
Sherri,"Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael."
Jim,Come on.
Michael,Thanks.
Jim,"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food."
Sherri,Mm-Hmm.
Michael,"I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year."
Michael,I'll call her back. Wish I could fire Sherri.
Children,Trick or treat!
Sherri,"Hey, I'm still here."
Michael,"He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great."
Michael,Okay! I'm sorry.
Kid,I'm a bumble bee.
Sherri,Yeah.
Michael,You look great! And you're a princess?
Michael,No?
Kid,A fairy princess.
Sherri,OK.
Michael,A fairy princess. You're very... .
Michael,Bye.
Kid,I'm a lion.
Sherri,Hanging up now.
Michael,"You're a lion. Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these."
Michael,"I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about."
Pam,You wanted me?
Michael,Yes.
Pam,Papier-mache?
Michael,Yes.
Pam,Hmm.
Michael,Yeeesh.
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Michael,"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do."
Pam,Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Michael,Because it's very scary stuff.
Pam,I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
Michael,You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
Pam,So it's a man?
Michael,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?"
Pam,I just answer the phone.
Michael,And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
Pam,You're costume is fantastic!
Michael,I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.
Pam,"Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. Aah! Okay..."
Michael,"Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody."
Dwight,What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Jim,"I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch."
Phyllis,That's great!
Jim,"Oh, yeah."
Dwight,"Yeah, well look... What about me?"
Phyllis,What are you? A monk?
Dwight,I am a Sith Lord. Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Phyllis,Ass.
Michael,Hey.
Oscar,Michael.
Michael,You guys excited about the party?
Angela,Yeah.
Michael,It's gonna be fun.
Kevin,Yeah.
Angela,Yes.
Michael,"Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day."
Oscar,What are you implying?
Michael,All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
Angela,"You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night."
Michael,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?"
Angela,Yeah.
Michael,"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers."
Angela,But we don't keep two sets of books.
Michael,"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it."
Michael,"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats."
Kelly,Why is that?
Michael,"""Bend It Like Beckham."""
Kelly,"Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?"
Michael,Yeah. That would be perfect.
Kelly,"Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything."
Michael,"Well, I don't really have two heads. So..."
Dwight,"Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH!"
Pam,"Okay, greatest strength."
Jim,"Okay, okay..."
Pam,A dog-like obedience to authority
Jim,Nice.
Pam,But that doesn't sound good.
Jim,"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player?"
Jim,"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India."
Pam,He's a gun nut.
Jim,Um. He sticks to his guns.
Angela,"Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department..."
Oscar,Yes?
Angela,... that has three people...
Oscar,Yeah?
Angela,... doing the work that could be done by two.
Oscar,This is great. Oh.
Kevin,Yeah. Oh.
Michael,Who do you think it should be?
Dwight,Jim. Definitely.
Michael,"No, Jim brings in money."
Dwight,Phyllis.
Michael,Eh.
Dwight,Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
Michael,It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
Dwight,One of the warehouse guys.
Michael,What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
Dwight,Who is he saying?
Michael,"You're right, I didn't even think of him."
Dwight,"No, Michael."
Michael,"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea."
Dwight,"No, not me."
Michael,Yeah... I could.
Dwight,Not Dwight.
Michael,I'm not saying that's what he said.
Dwight,I know that's what he said.
Michael,What?
Dwight,"Tell him, not Dwight."
Michael,That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
Dwight,Tell him to stop.
Michael,Are you kidding?
Dwight,"Quiet, you."
Michael,I agree. He'd land on his feet.
Dwight,Make him be quiet.
Angela,Those aren't chips and dip.
Pam,"No, I made brownies."
Angela,Uh!
Pam,... What?
Angela,I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
Pam,I made brownies.
Angela,And I made cookies. Same category.
Pam,I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Pam,"Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh, yeah. Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott."
Jim,"Um... Whoa. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay."
Dwight,"Stanley, could you come with me, please."
Stanley,No.
Dwight,As Assistant Regional Manager...
Stanley,To the.
Dwight,"Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry."
Stanley,You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Michael,So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
Dwight,He wouldn't listen to me
Michael,"Ahh, come on."
Dwight,"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself."
Michael,"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just..."
Dwight,"Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?"
Dwight,"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most."
Oscar,Oh... hey.
Ryan,"Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just..."
Oscar,Oh.
Dwight,"So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis..."
Pam,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real."
Pam,"Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job."
Jim,Um... it's in Maryland.
Pam,"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge."
Jim,Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.
Pam,Jim...
Dwight,"This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?"
Michael,"Oh, God."
Dwight,"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills."
Michael,Fantastic!
Dwight,And I turned it down.
Michael,What?! That would've solved all my problems.
Dwight,Out of loyalty to this company...
Michael,"Oh, you idiot."
Dwight,... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Michael,"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody."
Dwight,But then you wouldn't have me here.
Michael,"Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?"
Dwight,It's in Maryland.
Michael,You can call. Can you call 'em?
Dwight,I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Michael,Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
Jim,"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma."
Michael,Can I speak to you a minute?
Jim,Um... yes.
Jim,"Michael, I really didn't mean to..."
Michael,Help. Me.
Jim,I'm sorry?
Michael,"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it."
Jim,"Oh, you want me to be you?"
Michael,Yes.
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed."
Jim,"Oh, are you firing Creed?"
Michael,"No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head."
Jim,We should switch seats in order to...
Michael,"Yes, that's a good idea."
Jim,"Alright. Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal..."
Michael,Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
Jim,Wow.
Michael,"I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!"
Jim,That's an overreaction.
Michael,Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
Jim,"Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you..."
Michael,I... this is Creed.
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"I'm improvising, so just try to keep up."
Jim,"Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought."
Michael,"And I'm very angry, and I want..."
Jim,Michael Scott here.
Michael,I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
Jim,"Toby? Mm hmm. I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth..."
Michael,"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah."
Pam,What happened?
Jim,It wasn't me.
Pam,Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
Jim,"Yeah, I know."
Michael,"Uh, hey... Creed?"
Creed,Huh?
Michael,Could I talk to you for a second?
Michael,"You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop."
Creed,What are you telling me?
Michael,I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
Creed,"No, I don't. I wanna stay right here."
Michael,"No, you wanna leave."
Creed,"No, I wanna stay here."
Michael,Why... why are you making this so hard?
Creed,"Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael."
Michael,I think you're right.
Creed,Can I go?
Michael,"No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye."
Creed,Let's fight it.
Michael,Hmm?
Creed,Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Michael,What old days? What are you talking about?
Creed,Did you start the paperwork yet?
Michael,"It's right here on the desk, yeah."
Creed,"You don't have to do this, Michael."
Michael,"I can't, I can't..."
Creed,Undo it!
Michael,I can't change anything. This is the way...
Creed,"No, you have the power to undo it."
Michael,"I don't... okay, just listen."
Creed,"Michael, undo it!"
Michael,Don't...
Michael,"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?"
Michael,"I have to fire someone today, okay?"
Creed,Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Michael,"Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you."
Creed,"No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man."
Michael,Don't...
Creed,"Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible"
Michael,"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?"
Devon,"Creed's an idiot, you know that."
Michael,"Well, he..."
Devon,"No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time."
Michael,"Well, maybe I did."
Dwight,Where is my desk?
Michael,"Well, busier. Making the time."
Jim,That is weird.
Stanley,"Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday."
Dwight,This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.
Toby,We want to go home.
Jim,"Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk."
Michael,"Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby."
Dwight,I didn't lose my desk.
Pam,The shipping place closes in a half hour.
Jim,"Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it?"
Michael,"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight."
Dwight,"Okay, who moved my desk?"
Angela,This is illegal.
Jim,I think you should retrace your steps.
Stanley,I don't care.
Dwight,"Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!"
Michael,I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
Jim,"Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot."
Dwight,Of course.
Dwight,Dwight Schrute.
Michael,And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim,"Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model."
Dwight,"Michael, I don't know..."
Dwight,"Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times."
Michael,"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it."
Jim,I know.
Dwight,I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Dwight,It's by the ream?
Michael,"No, no, title change only."
Jim,"Uh, yeah, ream."
Dwight,I'll have Pam send out a memo.
Dwight,"...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%."
Michael,"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now."
Jim,"Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work."
Dwight,Just a formality.
Dwight,"Wash your hands, Kevin."
Michael,Absolutely but not really.
Jim,"Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second..."
Dwight,"Michael, I have so much to learn from you."
Dwight,"Sensei, hello it's Sempai..."
Michael,Yes you do.
Jim,Umm...
Dwight,"Thank you, Sensei."
Dwight,Dwight...
Michael,"And, ditto."
Jim,"You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks."
Michael,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo."
Dwight,"Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai."
Jim,Was that your mom?
Dwight,"No, that was my Sensei."
Jim,"Oh, I thought it was your mom."
Dwight,"I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei."
Jim,"Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool."
Dwight,Assistant Sensei.
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei."
Stanley,I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
Pam,I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
Pam,"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm."
Michael,"I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day."
Ryan,Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Michael,"Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information."
Ryan,Why is that secret?
Michael,"Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin."
Pam,"Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign."
Michael,"Yes, thank you. I know where to sign."
Pam,It's just last year you...
Michael,"Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?"
Pam,"Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier."
Michael,"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is."
Ryan,Updating emergency contacts.
Pam,"Well, is that really a priority?"
Michael,"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. ""Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority."" Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you."
Ryan,Catch-22.
Michael,"Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?"
Jim,"Uh, Larissa Halpert."
Ryan,What's her address?
Jim,117 Mount Bergin St.
Ryan,Hello?
Michael,Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
Ryan,Do you mean Neverland?
Michael,This is Tito.
Ryan,What?
Michael,Calling from...
Pam,You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
Jim,"You making this up as you go along, aren't you?"
Pam,I am just following the website.
Jim,"Well, at least I don't have cavities."
Pam,"Yes, you have very nice teeth."
Jim,Thanks.
Ryan,Who is your emergency contact?
Kevin,Stacy.
Ryan,
Michael,Pick up.
Ryan,Hello?
Michael,This is Mike Tyson.
Jim,"Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?"
Dwight,Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
Jim,No I'm not.
Dwight,"Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you."
Jim,"Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this"
Dwight,"Ok, give that back to me."
Jim,"Ok, say please."
Dwight,No. That is not a toy.
Jim,Please?
Dwight,Please?
Jim,"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou."
Dwight,Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
Michael,"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man."
Pam,Could you practice on the forms?
Dwight,"No women or children, unless provoked."
Jim,"Ok, Roy?"
Dwight,Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Jim,Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen."
Dwight,Because we're friends.
Michael,Because I would kick his ass.
Jim,"Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so..."
Michael,So? I've beaten up black belts.
Jim,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?"
Michael,"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out."
Ryan,Is your wife still your contact?
Toby,"Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now."
Ryan,'Kay.
Toby,You don't need to write 'ex'.
Michael,"And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again."
Jim,"Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way, right?"
Michael,You were a Jet?
Angela,Have you signed the expense reports yet?
Michael,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link."
Dwight,Argggg!
Michael,"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up."
Michael,Just hit me. You'll see.
Jim,I can't. I just got a manicure.
Michael,"Oh, queer... eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it."
Jim,Just have Dwight punch you.
Michael,"Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass."
Jim,You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Dwight,What belt are they?
Michael,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'..."
Dwight,No!
Michael,... he cried at the end of it. He did.
Dwight,"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight."
Michael,"Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?"
Dwight,"Ok, I'll punch you."
Michael,"Ok, here we go. Alright, come on."
Dwight,Kiyah!
Michael,Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
Dwight,"Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not."
Jim,Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Michael,Yeah. Thank you.
Dwight,I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
Jim,"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael."
Pam,I don't know.
Jim,"Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips."
Pam,French Onion?
Jim,Obviously.
Pam,Ok.
Jim,Yes.
Dwight,Take this pen and stab me with it.
Michael,Go away.
Pam,I just have a quick question.
Michael,"I haven't signed them, ok?"
Pam,"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?"
Michael,"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough."
Pam,He's a purple belt. That's really high.
Michael,"Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him."
Pam,"It's just out there, you..."
Michael,"Oh, so that's what they are saying?"
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?"
Jim,"Uh, Kitchen."
Michael,Ok.
Kelly,Hi-yah!
Dwight,Good.
Kelly,"Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight."
Dwight,"Now watch, let me take you from behind."
Kelly,What?
Michael,"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you."
Dwight,"I didn't sucker punch you, Michael."
Michael,"No, Really?"
Dwight,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai."
Michael,"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22."
Dwight,"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!"
Michael,"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches"
Dwight,"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective."
Michael,Really?
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
Jim,"Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo?"
Michael,"No, they must have class."
Dwight,"No, it's free during the day. It's fine."
Michael,Look...
Dwight,I've got the key.
Toby,Michael...
Michael,"Hey, Toby."
Toby,Any word on those time cards?
Michael,I've got an idea
Jim,"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight..."
Michael,I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
Ira,"Uh, no, it's not."
Michael,I think it is. A guy told me about that.
Ira,"Actually, it's a symbol for eternal discipline."
Michael,Oh.
Jim,"Wow, that is really interesting."
Pam,What?
Jim,Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
Pam,"Well, look closer."
Jim,"Oh, ok."
Pam,Once point for me.
Jim,Tied up.
Pam,"Oh, you're dead."
Jim,"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now."
Pam,"Hey, put me down. Put me down. Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey..."
Ira,"Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?"
Dwight,"Yes, Sensei!"
Michael,"Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner."
Ira,Shi mate!
Dwight,Hiii!
Michael,Hey!
Ira,"Alright, break."
Michael,What the hell was that?
Dwight,Yes!
Ira,Dwight - awarded a point.
Michael,No.
Dwight,Eat it!
Michael,"Alright, that's the way you want it."
Dwight,Two more.
Michael,"Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man."
Kevin,Sweep the leg.
Michael,"I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him."
Dwight,No.
Michael,I got his pants.
Dwight,It was my pants.
Ira,No points for pants.
Michael,"Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!"
Ira,"Clean single kick, gentlemen."
Michael,"Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya."
Ira,"Ok, break. Break."
Dwight,No holding.
Michael,"You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. Eight points. Nine points."
Dwight,"No, stop it! Come on! Michael."
Michael,Open your mouth.
Dwight,"No, Michael!"
Michael,"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? ""Raging Bull."" Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag."
Ryan's Voicemail,"Seven new messages. First New Message. ""Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein."" Next new message. ""Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and I'm mad!"""
Michael,My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
Ryan,Fudge?
Michael,"Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?"
Dwight,I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Ryan,"Ok, to what?"
Dwight,"Just put ""The Hospital."" Contact number"
Michael,"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man."
Kevin,Later Jim.
Jim,"Later, Kev. Have a good weekend."
Pam,"Yeah, you too."
Michael,Yeah.
Ryan,I have the emergency contacts.
Michael,"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?"
Ryan,"Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably."
Michael,"If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout."
Ryan,"Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday."
Michael,"Alright, bye."
Michael,Dwight?
Angela,"Michael, did you finish yet?"
Michael,"This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?"
Dwight,I'm busy.
Ryan,"Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie."
Jim,"Cause there was dinner, by candlelight."
Jim,No. They're in the conference room.
Pam,Uh hmm.
Ryan,Good.
Jim,"Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date."
Pam,"Wait, are those Michael's Levis?"
Pam,We didn't dance.
Ryan,"Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?"
Jim,"You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic."
Pam,"Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays."
Pam,Swaying isn't dancing.
Pam,I'll take those. Thanks.
Jim,Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
Jan,This is a projection of the county's needs...
Pam,I have some faxes to get out.
Michael,"Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today."
Jim,"Oh, come on, Pam. I-"
Jan,"Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals..."
Jim,"Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?"
Jim,"So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. Years."
Jan,"So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-"
Michael,I changed it. To Chili's.
Jan,Excuse me?
Michael,"Radisson just gives out this vibe, ""Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson"". It's kind of snooty. So."
Jan,"You had no right to do that, Michael."
Michael,Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
Jan,It said that.
Michael,It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.
Jan,Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.
Michael,"Uh huh, uh huh. Power trip."
Jan,What?
Oscar,"She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out."
Jim,No...
Oscar,"Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner."
Toby,That is unbelievable.
Pam,What is going on?
Jim,We are doing worst first dates.
Pam,"Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me."
Oscar,"Ok, that's a joke."
Pam,"No, they had to come back for me."
Jim,"Wait, when was this?"
Pam,Umm... it was not that long ago.
Kelly,"Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance."
Jim,"I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting."
Michael,"Ok, let's do this thing. Wish us luck."
Dwight,"Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan."
Jan,Thank you.
Michael,"Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now."
Jan,"Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour."
Michael,Well...
Jan,Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Michael,"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. Adios!"
Jan,So which way is Chili's?
Michael,"Uh, I'll drive."
Jan,"Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there."
Michael,"It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?"
Jan,I know Scranton.
Michael,At all!
Jan,Alright.
Michael,"You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-"
Jan,If it's a couple blocks away-
Michael,Dar de dar.
Jan,Ok.
Michael,"Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead."
Michael,We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Jan,Why would we need a signal?
Michael,"Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-"
Jan,"What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?"
Michael,"Well, I... it could be either of us."
Jan,"You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that."
Michael,Yeees.
Michael,Hello? Christian?
Christian,Yes.
Michael,Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
Jan,Just Jan Levinson.
Michael,No Gould?
Jan,No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long?
Christian,"No, not long."
Michael,"Uh, Jan, what happened?"
Jan,Michael.
Michael,Is Gould dead? What uh-
Jan,"Michael, we got divorced, ok? I'm so sorry. Excuse me."
Michael,"Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?"
Jan,"Michael. Uh, could we have a table for three, please?"
Michael,When did this happen?
Jan,We're in a meeting.
Michael,Ok.
Hostess,"This way, please."
Jan,Christian.
Michael,"Alright, after you."
Christian,Thank you.
Michael,
Jan,I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Christian,"Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-"
Michael,Awesome blossom.
Jan,What?
Michael,"I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?"
Christian,Sure.
Michael,"Ok, it's done. Actually, Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done."
Jan,So-
Michael,I heard a-
Jan,If you have a-
Michael,Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?
Jan,"Christian, you don't have to listen to this."
Christian,"It's ok, I like jokes."
Michael,Ok.
Jan,Just the one.
Michael,"Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo."
Pam,"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."
Michael,"Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me."
Pam,"Ok, you want me to read 'em?"
Michael,Yes.
Pam,"Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-"
Michael,No.
Pam,When-
Michael,Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.
Pam,Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Michael,"Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?"
Pam,Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
Jim,Is this real?
Pam,It is a screenplay. Starring himself.
Jim,Agent Michael Scarn.
Pam,Of the FBI.
Jim,"How long is this? Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings."
Pam,What is that?
Jim,"Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like."
Michael,"First guy says ""Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn"". And the second guy says, ""Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort"". And the third guy says ""I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe""."
Christian,"Ohhh no! Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!"
Jan,"Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?"
Jim,"Do we all have our copy of ""Threat Level"
Everyone,"Yeah, yeah."
Jim,"Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones."
Phyllis,That's the character's name?
Jim,Oh yeah-
Dwight,"Ok, you guys should not be doing this."
Jim,"Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy."
Dwight,You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Jim,Dwight-
Dwight,Brought it in here-
Jim,Do you want to play-
Dwight,Made copies of it-
Jim,The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
Michael,Yum! Yum yum yum! That's delicious! I love it!
Jan,"We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match."
Christian,"Well, we are out to save money."
Jan,What's the bottom line?
Michael,"Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop."
Michael,"That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault."
Michael,"Did somebody say ""baby back ribs""? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?"
Jan,I don't think Christian has time for that.
Christian,I have time.
Michael,"I want my baby back, baby back, baby back"
Michael and Christian,"I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-"
Michael,Chili's baby back ribs...
Jim,"Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters."
Phyllis,"Sir, you have some messages."
Dwight,Not now!
Phyllis,They're important.
Dwight,"Ok, what are they?"
Phyllis,First message is
Dwight,"Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!"
Dwight,"Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of ""Oklahoma"" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good."
Dwight,"If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang."
Ryan,"Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight."
Dwight,Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission.
Pam,"Hey, uh, I have to work late."
Roy,You're joking right?
Jim,Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
Dwight,Pow! Pow! Pow!
Ryan,"Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word."
Kevin,Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. Heh.
Jim,"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?"
Oscar,"Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?"
Dwight,"Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage."
Ryan,"I forget it, brutha."
Dwight,"Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. Wait, who's Dwigt?"
Pam,"Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops."
Dwight,D-W-I-G-H-T.
Dwight,"Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end."
Jim,"Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-"
Dwight,"Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now."
Jim,"That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry?"
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,Yeah?
Christian,"So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her."
Michael,"Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh."
Jan,"Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really."
Michael,"Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing."
Christian,It's not fair.
Michael,She's not playing the game.
Jan,We'd been fighting for a while-
Michael,Check please.
Jan,"He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind"
Christian,You didn't.
Jan,I was stupid.
Michael and Christian,No.
Michael,"No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?"
Christian,That's right.
Michael,You know?
Christian,"You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists."
Michael,It's true.
Christian,"You said ""World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!"""
Jim,"I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer."
Jim,Wow.
Pam,For the bugs.
Jim,"Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich."
Pam,Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
Christian,Right down the street?
Michael,"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices."
Christian,I know.
Michael,It's bad.
Christian,It's terrible.
Michael,"It, you know what, it really is."
Jan,Uh-
Christian,"I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts."
Michael,"Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?"
Jim,"So, I guess I'll see you in ten hours."
Pam,What are you going to do with your time off?
Jim,Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself.
Pam,You have new music?
Jim,Yeah. Definitely.
Michael,See ya.
Jan,Bye... thanks. Yes!
Michael,We did it!
Jan,We got it!
Michael,Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.
Jan,I am really- Thrilled. Let's go.
Michael,What!?
Jan,Let's go.
Michael,Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. Oh-ok.
Dwight,Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan?
Michael,"Morning, Pam. Hey."
Michael,"No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So."
Michael,"Hello, Dwight."
Dwight,Did you do her?
Michael,Who.
Dwight,Jan Levinson-Gould.
Michael,"Uh, no, no, no Gould."
Dwight,Did you do her?
Michael,This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
Dwight,And she is your boss.
Michael,"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all?"
Jim,Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
Pam,What!?
Jim,Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
Pam,"Oh, I don't know... Oh my God. This is Jan's cell."
Jim,No way.
Pam,"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."
Michael,I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question
Jim,Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
Pam,"Oh, really?"
Jim,Really.
Pam,Why might some say that?
Dwight,You should get one of these.
Pam,As a human being.
Jim,No. Thank you.
Jim,"Yeah, no, I don't think you can."
Dwight,Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Jan,I'm heading back to New York
Jim,Done.
Michael,Wait.
Dwight,This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry.
Jan,'K?
Jim,S'ok.
Michael,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?"
Dwight,"Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x."
Jan,"Michael, now is not the time or the place."
Jim,You're not having s*x.
Michael,"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?"
Dwight,"Plus, improves your reflexes see, I would have caught that."
Jan,"No, I am saying we are never having this conversation."
Jim,"Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?"
Michael,"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?"
Dwight,It's only twenty-five bucks.
Jan,"Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'"
Jim,"Wow. Um, ok."
Michael,"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?"
Michael,"Pam, could I see you in my office?"
Jan,"Michael, it has nothing-"
Pam,"It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect."
Michael,Am I too short?
Michael,"Pam, you're trustworthy-"
Jan,"With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate."
Pam,Thank you.
Michael,Really?
Michael,And a woman-
Jan,"Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?"
Pam,"Oh, no."
Michael,"I appreciate that, thank you."
Michael,"And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."" First impressions?"
Jan,"And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-"
Pam,"Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon."
Michael,"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-"
Michael,"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual."
Jan,"At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?"
Michael,"""I guess I missed you."" I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?"
Michael,So my looks have nothing to do with it?
Pam,She missed you.
Jan,"Ohhh, God."
Michael,"But then she goes on to say ""that will be our only topic of discussion"". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words."
Michael,Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed
Pam,I have one idea of what it means.
Michael,"Hey, it's 12"
Michael,"Ok. Yeah, what, what?"
Jim,Ummm... no idea.
Pam,Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
Michael,"Never missed a day, my ass."
Michael,"Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-"
Pam,[Jim bows to Pam
Pam,"Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you."
Dwight,I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
Michael,"Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?"
Pam,"Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward."
Michael,"Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you""."
Dwight,"Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review."
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
Jim,We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
Dwight,"Oh, yes, we do."
Jim,"No, we don't."
Dwight,"Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise."
Jim,"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease."
Dwight,"Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?"
Jim,I win.
Dwight,"Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid."
Jim,"Wait, wait"
Dwight,"Uh, duh."
Jim,Duh.
Jim,Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
Stanley,Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Michael,Really?
Stanley,"Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses."
Michael,"God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry."
Stanley,"Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact."
Michael,No kidding.
Stanley,It's all about my bonus.
Pam,Michael and Jan definitely made out.
Jim,Ohh...
Pam,Maybe more.
Jim,"Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'."
Pam,"Oh, yea!"
Michael,"Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn."
Angela,I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
Pam,Michael?
Michael,Yeah?
Pam,Jan's on the phone for you.
Michael,Oh
Michael,Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. Yeah?
Jan,Michael.
Michael,Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?
Jan,I am returning your many calls.
Michael,"Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's."
Jan,"No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch."
Michael,"Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's."
Jan,"Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael."
Michael,Oh.
Jan,I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Michael,Been thinking about you.
Jan,"Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior."
Michael,"Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-"
Jan,Michael.
Michael,Yep.
Jan,Are the cameras with you...
Michael,No.
Jan,...in your office?
Michael,"They are not. Yes, they are. That's my girlfriend."
Kevin,I heard they made out and had s*x.
Oscar,"No, they just made out. That's it."
Kevin,"Well, I heard they made out and had s*x."
Angela,Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
Kevin,Romances?
Michael,"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A ""Michael-idea"" folder?"
Pam,Sorry.
Michael,That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.
Pam,What suggestion box?
Michael,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?"
Pam,"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started."
Michael,"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p."
Ryan,Don't you mean constructive criticism?
Michael,What did I say?
Kelly,"You said ""constructive complements"""
Michael,"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?"
Jim,"Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11"
Dwight,Saturday.
Jim,"...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon."
Jan,"We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?"
Pam,Sure.
Michael,"Hi, Jan. How are you?"
Jan,I'm good
Michael,Good to see you.
Jan,Nice to see you.
Michael,"Ok. Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here."
Jan,Can we please go in your office?
Michael,"Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. No calls."
Kevin,Oooo.
Michael,Alright.
Jan,Thank you.
Michael,It's nice to see you.
Jan,"Nice to see you too, Michael."
Michael,Really?
Jan,Not like that.
Michael,"Oh, well."
Jan,"You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business."
Michael,Alright.
Jan,Period.
Michael,Yep.
Jan,Do we understand each other.
Michael,Absolutely.
Michael,"I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because ""Oh, I regret that."" But, ""Wait, I'm still gonna call you."" But, but, ""We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job."" But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business."
Jan,So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Michael,"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual. We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?"
Jan,No.
Michael,"This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise."
Jan,Fine.
Michael,Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Jan,How is that a business question?
Michael,"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy."
Jan,"Please don't smell me, Michael."
Pam,"Hey, Jim."
Jim,"Hey, how's it goin'?"
Pam,"Oh my God, did you see ""The Apprentice"" last night?"
Jim,"Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?"
Pam,Can you believe who Trump fired?
Jim,"No, that was unbelievable."
Dwight,Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?
Pam,You didn't see it?
Dwight,"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night"
Michael,"I don't understand- Hold on. Sorry. Yes, Pam."
Pam,"Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting."
Michael,I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
Pam,You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Michael,"I did not, not, not use those words."
Jan,"Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting is it happening right now?"
Michael,"No, it's in like ten minutes."
Pam,Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
Jan,Great. Very good.
Michael,"Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one"
Dwight,What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Kelly,I thought you read these every week.
Michael,"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally."
Dwight,It happens occasionally.
Michael,"And, um, one down. Next suggestion"
Jan,"That sounds serious, Michael."
Michael,"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?"
Dwight,Tom?
Michael,Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
Phyllis,Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. Tom? Pow.
Michael,"Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion."
Dwight,Next suggestion.
Michael,"Arrr, dooby dooby do. ""You need to do something about your B.O."""
Dwight,You need to do something about your B.O.
Michael,"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody."
Toby,Aren't the suggestions meant for you?
Michael,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words."
Creed,"Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring."
Michael,"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. ""You need to do something about your coffee breath""-"
Dwight,You need-
Michael,Ok.
Dwight,To do something about-
Michael,"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box."
Angela,Sometimes you talk to us real close.
Michael,"Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-"
Angela,"Well, when you have coffee breath-"
Michael,I'll work on that-
Angela,It's hard.
Michael,"Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow."
Dwight,"Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?"
Michael,"Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion."
Dwight,Next suggestion.
Michael,"""Don't sl-"", ok, that's blank Don't, just put it-"
Dwight,"""Don't sleep with your boss""? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?"
Jan,"I can't, I can't-"
Michael,I don't understand why you're so upset.
Jan,Please sit down.
Michael,Let me ask you-
Jan,You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Michael,"Ok, let me ask you this."
Jan,"Please, sit yourself down."
Michael,Let me ask you something.
Jan,"What, Michael."
Michael,Where did you get your outfit?
Dwight,[loud metal music playing in a stairwell
Michael,I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Jan,"Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same"
Michael,Look-
Dwight,Michael?
Michael,Oh my God...
Dwight,"I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God"
Jan,"No, Dwight"
Dwight,Great.
Michael,What do you want Dwight?
Dwight,I am ready for my performance review.
Michael,"Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave"
Jan,"Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?"
Michael,"You wanna talk now, good"
Dwight,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?"
Michael,Why on earth would we give you a raise?
Dwight,That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word
Michael,You do? How do you get in?
Dwight,I have a copy of your key.
Jan,That's a serious offense!
Michael,That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.
Jan,"Oh! Michael, for God sakes!"
Dwight,I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Michael,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?"
Dwight,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office."
Michael,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!"
Dwight,You liked it!
Michael,"Oh, did not!"
Dwight,"Jan, have you ever had deer?"
Jan,No.
Dwight,"It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise."
Michael,"What do you say, Jan?"
Jan,Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do
Michael,"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head."
Jan,"Thank you, Dwight."
Jan,"Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light?"
Dwight,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said ""Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of""."
Michael,That's from Superman?
Dwight,"Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise."
Pam,Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
Jim,"I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam."
Pam,How do you come back from that?
Jim,"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together."
Pam,"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?"
Jim,Oh-
Michael,"It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Oh my God. Ohhh. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here."
Pam,"Hey Phyllis, come here for a second."
Jim,Are we in danger?
Phyllis,Sure.
Michael,"There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody."
Pam,Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Kevin,"Michael, should I call the... What?"
Phyllis,"You tell me. Well, you do mean you and Jim right? Oh God. I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time. I'm sorry!"
Michael,The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
Pam,That's ok. It's ok.
Michael,"Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected..."
Kevin,Not so fast... Fire Guy.
Sadiq (IT guy),That just means you have to enter your password.
Mary-Beth,How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here?
Michael,Oh...
Bill,"Oh, don't worry. We're all gonna carpool."
Sadiq (IT guy),"What's your password, Michael?"
Michael,"So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's? Go to Bernie's?"
Michael,"Oh, umm..."
Bill,"Oh sorry, we're not going as a group, it's just a private friend who just happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing."
Sadiq (IT guy),"Oh, it's 1-2-3."
Michael,"Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it."
Michael,Yes.
Bill,Ok.
Dwight,Mi-
Michael,"Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not."
Michael,AH! Guh-oood.
Phyllis,Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known...
Dwight,Sorry.
Jim,Oh by the way how's your side project going?
Michael,Please don't do that.
Pam,"Oh, yeah I gave that up."
Dwight,"Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?"
Jim,Really?
Michael,I can't tell you.
Pam,"Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws."
Dwight,You have to tell me.
Pam,"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on."
Michael,I don't have to tell you anything.
Kevin,"Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore."
Dwight,"Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over."
Dwight,Surprise! Everybody!
Michael,"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Brrr! That's strong!"
Phyllis,Dwight...
Dwight,"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-"
Michael,"Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in. There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket! Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine?"
Michael,I'm not going get a brain-
Michael,"Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---"
Dwight,Or get hit by a car-
Michael and Jim,"It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh."
Michael,Stop it.
Michael,We're making love!
Dwight,"Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke."
Michael and Jim,"Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong? Sail away with me..."
Michael,"Uh, oh, ok"
Michael,Talk! Just talk!
Michael,"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails."
Mary-Beth,I am-
Michael,So how do you search?
Michael,Shut up!
Sadiq (IT guy),By keyword phrase.
Michael,Funny story
Michael,"Try ""profits"". No! Try ""Michael Scott"". ""Michael"" ""boss"" and ""funny"". [Sadiq (IT guy) types"
Oscar,"Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers?"
Michael,"Oh, no, everybody"
Oscar,"Actually, it's just-"
Michael,Beep! Bop!
Oscar,Ok...
Michael,Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk. Oil can. Oil can.
Oscar,Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Michael,"Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose."
Dwight,So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?
Michael,You know what the problem is?
Stanley,I think I do.
Michael,"The problem is that when people hear the term ""big brother"", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother."
Kevin,I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.
Dwight,"Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately."
Angela,I know.
Dwight,Good.
Pam,Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
Jim,What?
Pam,I know!
Jim,Hmm...
Pam,Do you think that they're like-
Jim,No.
Pam,"No, right, no, no."
Jim,
Pam,"Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?"
Pam,It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo... If you guys see anything... ?
Pam,"Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with."
Dwight,Nice.
Pam,"One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?"
Dwight,Does he have access to their medical records?
Pam,Ummmm...
Dwight,"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory."
Michael,"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No."
Pam,"Hey, Angela-"
Angela,Hi.
Pam,How's it going?
Angela,It's ok.
Pam,"Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?"
Angela,No. Are we supposed to?
Pam,"No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so."
Angela,Hmm... Excuse me.
Pam,Oh.
Michael,"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler."
Kevin,That's pretty young.
Pam,Yeah.
Kevin,Are you gonna eat with us?
Michael,"Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup."
Jim,Uh hum.
Michael,"Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors."
Pam,The professors would go to the parties?
Michael,Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.
Jim,"It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up. He is very real."
Pam,What? Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!
Dwight,Question
Jim,"Oh, uh, no. Could-"
Dwight,I was wondering-
Jim,"Could, keep that down."
Dwight,Why?
Jim,Because not everybody knows about the party.
Dwight,Like who? Who doesn't know?
Jim,"Umm, Michael."
Dwight,Why just Michael?
Jim,Because it's a surprise.
Dwight,Is it?
Jim,Uh hmm.
Dwight,"Oh, that's perfect!"
Jim,"So, don't tell."
Dwight,I won't.
Jim,Ok.
Jim,"So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael."
Pam,Really? That's great.
Jim,I know.
Pam,Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Jim,"Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or..."
Pam,"Oh, no, he can't make it."
Jim,"Oh, ok, cool."
Michael,Hey there.
Jim,Hey.
Michael,Almost quittin' time.
Jim,"Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock."
Michael,"One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out."
Jim,"Oh, um... .I can't."
Michael,You have plans.
Jim,"Uh hmm, definitely."
Michael,"I do, too. I do, too."
Jim,You do?
Michael,"I do, yeah. Big plans."
Jim,"Because you said ""do you wanna hang out""-"
Michael,"Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-"
Jim,Really?
Michael,Yeah.
Jim,"Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun."
Michael,"It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go."
Jim,Improv sounds great.
Michael,It is. Ok.
Jim,Alright.
Michael,What?
Jim,I think Stanley just coughed.
Michael,"Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?"
Pam,No thanks.
Michael,"Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with-"
Oscar,I'm on a call.
Michael,"Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?"
Kevin,My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Michael,"Ok, alright."
Kevin,Oh.
Michael,"Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to?"
Angela,I'm just leaving for the day.
Michael,"Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed?"
Angela,Charity. Bake drive.
Michael,Liar!
Angela,No!
Michael,You are a liar.
Angela,"No, I'm not."
Michael,"Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy."
Dwight,Battlestar Galatica.
Michael,"That's, whatever stupid show you want-"
Dwight,I can't-
Michael,To watch tonight
Dwight,Tonight.
Michael,We're watching it.
Dwight,"Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice."
Michael,"I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight."
Dwight,Clarinet.
Michael,"You, too, Dwight?"
Dwight,"Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. He has no idea!"
Jim,"Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy."
Dwight,"Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?"
Mark,"Hey, you must be Dwight!"
Dwight,You don't work with us.
Jim,That's because Mark's my roommate.
Mark,"Hey, I love the Birkenstocks."
Dwight,"Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here."
Jim,Uh hmm.
Dwight,When is the guest of honor coming?
Jim,"Oh, uh, later-ish."
Dwight,He's gonna love it!
Jim,Great. Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Pam,Definitely.
Jim,"Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to."
Ryan,"Hey, is Katy coming?"
Jim,"Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while."
Ryan,"Huh, is it ok if I call her?"
Jim,We can talk about that later.
Improv Teacher,"Ok, let's get right into it. I need two people for the first scene."
Michael,"Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air."
Improv Teacher,"Ok, Michael. And... anybody? How about Mary-Beth? Come on. Ok, so you start us off Mary-Beth."
Mary-Beth,Great. La la la la la laaa...
Michael,Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI.
Michael,Think about this
Girl acting Pregnant,I'm supposed to meet my doctor here? Have ya seen him? He's a very angry midget.
Michael,"Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI. You know what you did. Boom! Boom! Boom! Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't ya!? Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds. I been on to you and your little friends for weeks. Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Actor,I'm not even in the scene!
Actress,Again!?
Michael,Boom! Boom!
Improv Teacher,"Stop, stop, ok, stop."
Michael,Boom! Boom!
Improv Teacher,"You shot me, great. Now stop."
Michael,Why
Improv Teacher,You can't just shoot everyone in the scene.
Michael,"Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going."
Improv Teacher,"Ok, what about the scene they set up?"
Michael,Boring.
Improv Teacher,"No, it wasn't. No more guns."
Michael,I could of-
Improv Teacher,"No. No. Michael, I want you to give me all the guns you have."
Michael,Ok.
Improv Teacher,"Just, I want you to get rid of all your guns and give them to me. Great."
Michael,Yehhhehh.
Improv Teacher,"Yeeehh, ok."
Pam,Jim's bedroom.
Jim,"See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's-"
Pam,Cool... This is your desk.
Jim,This is my desk.
Pam,Your home office?
Jim,"My home office, this is it."
Pam,Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
Jim,"Ok, sure. Will do."
Pam,"Ok, wait, so that would make me like right here."
Jim,"Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right."
Pam,And Dwight would be like-
Jim,"You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts."
Pam,"Umm, yearbook!"
Jim,"Yeah, you don't have to, ummm. Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all."
Pam,Ooooohhh no!
Jim,Oh yeah.
Pam,You were so dorky!
Jim,Thank you.
Improv Teacher,Freeze!
Michael,I'm in.
Improv Teacher,You wanna go over the rules one more time?
Michael,"No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune."
Bill,"I promise it's worthit . Ooo, I can see you walking out of here and you're thrilled with your reading."
Michael,What are you...
Improv Teacher,"Michael, what did you tell him?"
Michael,Nothing.
Improv Teacher,Then why are his hands up? Bill?
Bill,"He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun."
Improv Teacher,"Ok, let's call it a day. Nice job, Bill."
Michael,"Good, it's good. Good work, everybody."
Jim,"Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun?"
Angela,I got sap on me.
Jim,"Chicken, hot dog, burger."
Angela,I'm a vegetarian.
Jim,There is soda inside.
Angela,Guh.
Stanley,I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
Oscar,"Yeah, it surprised us all. I'll tell you why. Because when they---"
Kelly,I'm sorry guys
Angela,I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine.
Dwight,Go. Get the door.
Jim,I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
Michael,Here we are.
Dwight,This is so awesome.
Dwight,Go. Push!
Michael,"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to."
Michael,Oh god.
Dwight,Thank you.
Dwight,Push!
Michael,You're welcome.
Michael,"No, no, turn it around."
Todd Packer,"Merry Christmas, asswipe!"
Dwight,Really shove it.
Michael,"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!"
Michael,You'll break it.
Todd Packer,What's up my nerds. Check it out.
Dwight,Shove it through! Break it!
Michael,"Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake."
Michael,"You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight."
Todd Packer,Pacman need a drinky.
Michael,All right.
Michael,"Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up."
Dwight,I got a splinter.
Kevin,Yeahhh.
Michael,"Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! Nice, huh?"
Michael,Darryl. There you go. You earned it.
Dwight,I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
Darryl,"That's okay, Mike."
Michael,"On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three."
Michael,"No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it."
Dwight,"One, two, three."
Darryl,"All right. Thanks, man."
Michael,Merry Christmas!
Michael,"Hey, Merry Christmas."
Michael,Did it work?
Ryan,Whose butt is that?
Kevin,"Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?"
Kevin,Mine.
Michael,"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year."
Ryan,"Oh, how did I not guess that?"
Kevin,But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Michael,Lampshade on head! It's happening!
Michael,"Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about."
Creed,"Oh, no."
Jim,"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel."
Kelly,Hey.
Angela,"Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?"
Dwight,"Oh, hello there. But what are you doing?"
Phyllis,"Yes, I got those cute little ones. Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?"
Kelly,I don't know.
Angela,We'll see.
Dwight,You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Ryan,Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Kevin,"Thanks for the party, Michael."
Michael,"Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?"
Meredith,Yeah.
Angela,Fifty.
Bob Vance,"Oh, hey. Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in?"
Michael,Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
Oscar,I'm in.
Michael,"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that."
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,"I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive."
Oscar,Michael? Poor Richard's?
Pam,You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
Michael,"Yeah, that sounds good."
Michael,"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody."
Michael,"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time."
Kevin & Oscar,"One, two, three."
Michael,"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?"
Dwight,You guys should use a hand truck.
Meredith,Yep.
Kevin,Do we have one?
Michael,"Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?"
Dwight,No.
Meredith,Yeah.
Angela,Will you help me?
Michael,Okay!
Michael,No! No way! It... no.
Darryl,"Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours."
Michael,You wanna be Santa?
Darryl,Yeah.
Michael,Have you ever seen Santa?
Darryl,"Yeah, I've seen Santa."
Michael,Okay.
Darryl,Who cares?
Michael,"Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work."
Dwight,"Michael, I would like to be the elf."
Michael,That makes sense because he has elfish features.
Dwight,"Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael."
Toby,I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
Oscar,"I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain."
Kevin,"I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't."
Michael,You get something good this year?
Jim,I think I did a pretty good job.
Michael,Yeah? Who did you have?
Jim,"Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret."
Michael,I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
Jim,Yeah?
Michael,I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Jim,"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?"
Michael,Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
Jim,"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .."
Michael,It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
Dwight,"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons."
Stanley,I know how to plug something in.
Dwight,I want to do it.
Michael,"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?"
All,"Three, two, one."
Michael,Not great.
Phyllis,"I'm sorry, everybody."
Pam,I think the tree looks nice.
Dwight,"Hey, I could get some flares from my car."
Michael,"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa."
Michael,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, ""Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."""
Dwight,"First present, Oscar."
Oscar,Shower radio. Neat.
Kelly,"Oh, good, that was from me."
Oscar,"Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .."
Dwight,Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
Jim,"Oh, cool."
Creed,That's from me.
Jim,Great. Where did you get it?
Creed,I don't know. It was so long ago.
Jim,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag."
Creed,Yep. That's exactly what happened.
Dwight,Pam.
Pam,"Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome."
Jim,There's a little more to it.
Dwight,"All right, next. Ryan."
Michael,"No, don't!"
Ryan,"Whoa, a video iPod."
Michael,"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away."
Ryan,Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Michael,You don't know that.
Ryan,"Yeah, you left the price tag on."
Michael,I did?
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?"
Dwight,Michael.
Michael,"Oh hey, for me. What is in here? Oh, come on."
Phyllis,I knitted it for you.
Michael,An oven mitt? Okay.
Michael,"So Phyllis is basically saying, ""Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth."" I gave Ryan an iPod."
Kevin,Should we just keep opening up the presents?
Dwight,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
Michael,I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
Jim,What is Yankee Swap?
Michael,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift."
Jim,I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
Pam,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant."
Michael,"Well, I call it fun!"
Oscar,Why are we doing this?
Michael,Because it's better. Because it's more special.
Angela,It sounds mean.
Michael,"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot."
Angela,Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.
Michael,"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt."
Meredith,I'll take the teapot.
Jim,"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam."
Michael,"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now."
Pam,I'll take the iPod.
Ryan,And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Dwight,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift."
Stanley,That was meant for Kelly.
Ryan,"Yeah, I figured."
Michael,I think this is going great.
Kelly,Yikes.
Toby,"Well, it's for Angela, so .."
Kelly,"That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen."
Dwight,"Angela, you're up."
Angela,I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
Kelly,I will steal the iPod.
Michael,Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
Michael,"Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn."
Oscar,I'll take the ... teapot.
Meredith,Damn it.
Dwight,"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go."
Meredith,I really want the iPod.
Dwight,It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Michael,"I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful."
Meredith,I'll take the oven mitt.
Michael,"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology."
Michael,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm."
Michael,"""In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."""
Dwight,"You and me, Michael. Yes!"
Michael,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
Dwight,I never said it was better than an iPod.
Dwight,"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand."
Dwight,"Take that, Saddam!"
Michael,Last gift. Kevin.
Kevin,I want the foot bath.
Kevin,"That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot."
Dwight,"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift."
Pam,I want the iPod.
Kelly,Damn it.
Jim,Sure you don't want the teapot?
Pam,"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But .."
Jim,Right.
Pam,"Sorry, I .."
Jim,No. No. Definitely. It's ..
Kelly,"Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories."
Dwight,Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Jim,Got to be kidding me.
Dwight,Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Michael,What is she so upset about?
Pam,Maybe because you hated her present so much.
Michael,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Jim,"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people."
Stanley,And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
Michael,"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!"
Oscar,You got a bonus check?
Pam,How much?
Michael,"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000."
Stanley,"All right, I'm done now."
Michael,"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame."
Liquor Store Clerk,It comes to $166.41.
Michael,"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?"
Liquor Store Clerk,"Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it."
Michael,"Cool, cool. Box it up."
Jim,"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?"
Dwight,No trades.
Jim,"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck."
Dwight,"""A real man makes his own luck."" Billy Zane. Titanic."
Jim,"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?"
Dwight,No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
Jim,You don't even drink tea.
Dwight,"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .."
JIm,Okay ..
Dwight,".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so."
Jim,"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle."
Roy,This is awesome.
Pam,I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
Roy,"Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money."
Pam,So what are you going to get me instead?
Roy,"I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something."
Michael,Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
Angela,What is that?
Michael,"This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze."
Meredith,We can drink?
Toby,We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.
Michael,"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?"
Meredith,Me. Please.
Michael,"Go, here we go!"
Meredith,"The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week."
Phyllis,Hi guys.
Ryan,Hey.
Phyllis,"Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?"
Kevin,Kevin Malone.
Bob Vance,"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."
Stanley,Stanley Hudson.
Bob Vance,"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."
Ryan,Ryan Howard.
Bob Vance,"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."
Ryan,"What line of work you in, Bob?"
Roy,"I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man."
Darryl,"Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done."
Roy,"It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man."
Darryl,I had to. I needed defense.
Roy,Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
Darryl,It's defense.
Roy,"Oh, no. That is not worth it."
Darryl,It is worth it.
Roy,Never.
Darryl,Are you kidding? You wait.
Michael,"Anybody making out in here? Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. Okay, how's it going in here?"
Ryan,We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Angela,There should be some ..
Michael,"No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party."
"Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Kevin","One, two, three."
Michael,"Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee."
Ryan,"Oh, no."
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ryan,I really did not do anything.
Michael,"Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend."
Jim,"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know."
Pam,"No, I was just checking out my present."
Jim,But ..
Pam,"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .."
Jim,"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside."
Pam,Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Pam,"Yeah, I think I made the right choice."
Pam,"Oh, my God! It's incredible. Is this the Boggle timer?"
Jim,Hey.
Dwight,Hello. Jim?
Jim,"What's up, buddy?"
Dwight,This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Jim,"Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good."
Dwight,"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy."
Jim,"Who, Steve?"
Dwight,"Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is."
Pam,"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup."
Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup."
Pam,"Um, I don't think so, I just bought it."
Dwight,"Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me."
Pam,I love these.
Dwight,"Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?"
Jim,"Oh, there it is. J1."
Dwight,But I don't have any...
Jim,"Here, you know what? You can have some nickels."
Dwight,"Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five..."
Michael,"Hello, everyone."
Dwight,"Good morning, Michael."
Phyllis,Where are we going this afternoon?
Michael,Ah! Ha ha ha!
Pam,"Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo."
Jim,"""It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."""
Pam,A ski mask and a swimsuit.
Jim,"So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers."
Pam,And brush our teeth.
Michael,Yeah?
Stanley,Michael.
Michael,Stanley! Bo banley.
Stanley,I need to know...
Michael,Banana fana fo fanley.
Stanley,What we're doing.
Michael,Be my mo manley.
Stanley,You said bring a toothbrush.
Michael,Stanley.
Stanley,Is this an overnight?
Michael,"Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?"
Stanley,Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
Michael,"Maybe, I don't know."
Stanley,Not maybe. Yes or no.
Michael,"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack."
Stanley,In January?
Michael,It's cheaper.
Michael,This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
Michael,It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
Meredith,All right!
Ryan,I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Michael,"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan."
Ryan,I'm already in business school.
Michael,"Well, this..."
Kelly,"Wait, Michael?"
Michael,Yeah?
Kelly,Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Michael,To throw you off the scent.
Kelly,"Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit."
Michael,"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it."
Kelly,I took the tags off already.
Michael,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Who is this smart little cookie?"" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say."
Michael,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course."
Michael,"Leader... ship. The word ""ship"" is hidden inside the word ""leadership,"" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!"
Oscar,"Last year, Michael's theme was ""Bowl over the Competition!"" So guess where we went."
Michael,"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?"
Darryl,How about the sales department is the sails?
Michael,"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace."
Phyllis,A furnace?
Jim,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?"
Pam,How about the anchor?
Phyllis,What does the furnace do?
Michael,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!"
Jim,I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Michael,Titanic?
Pam,I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
Michael,"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!"
Jim,"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck."
Phyllis,"Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned."
Michael,"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse."
Darryl,What?
Michael,"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship."
Dwight,"Aye aye, Captain."
Michael,"A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour."
Michael,"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan."
Dwight,Cool.
Captain Jack,"Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan."
Michael,"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party."
Captain Jack,"I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. Hi, welcome aboard."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose."
Michael,"Hey, look! I'm king of the world!"
Captain Jack,"Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack."
Michael,"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!"
Captain Jack,Okay! So...
Michael,Okay! So...
Captain Jack,Please. The life preservers.
Michael,Right.
Captain Jack,"They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat."
Michael,"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight."
Captain Jack,"Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here..."
Michael,I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
Captain Jack,"Okay, Michael, if you don't mind..."
Michael,Rock it!
Captain Jack,"Please, okay?"
Michael,"If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!"
Captain Jack,Michael.
Michael,Yep.
Captain Jack,"Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?"
Michael,We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
Captain Jack,Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
Michael,Hm? Okay. Yep.
Katy,"You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?"
Roy,Yeah.
Katy,"Pam, were you a cheerleader?"
Roy,"No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!"
Katy,That's hilarious.
Jim,"It's not hilarious, but..."
Roy,Where did you go to school?
Katy,Bishop O'Hara.
Roy,"Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?"
Jim,"Um, no."
Katy,"Yes, I did! A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!"
Roy,I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Michael,Having fun?
Brenda,Yeah. Everybody's really nice.
Michael,"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers."
Brenda,When are you going to start the presentation?
Michael,"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support."
Captain Jack,"Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!"
Michael,"So, okay."
Dwight,"Limbo, whoo!"
Captain Jack,All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
Meredith,Me.
Captain Jack,Okay...
Dwight,"Me! Me, me, me."
Captain Jack,Uh... usually it's a woman.
Dwight,I'm stronger.
Captain Jack,"Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?"
Captain Jack,Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
Dwight,"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats."
Captain Jack,"All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!"
Michael,"But before that, I have to do my presentation."
Captain Jack,Nope! Dance contest!
Michael,"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!"
Michael,Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
Dwight,What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
Angela,"Hey, come inside and talk to me."
Dwight,"I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!"
Darryl and Katy,Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!
Roy,"Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!"
Pam,"No, I'm not going to do that."
Roy,Come on!
Darryl,That's what I'm talking about!
Pam,"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?"
Roy,I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! Darryl! Darryl!
Pam,It's getting kind of rowdy down there.
Jim,Yeah. Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Pam,Sometimes I just don't get Roy.
Jim,Well...
Pam,"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?"
Jim,"Oh, um..."
Pam,I'm cold.
Captain Jack,"So, what's this presentation all about?"
Michael,"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?"
Captain Jack,Women and children.
Michael,"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers."
Captain Jack,That's a stupid analogy.
Michael,"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership."
Captain Jack,"Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm."
Dwight,Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour."
Katy,I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
Pam,"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice."
Captain Jack,"Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?"
Jim,"Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king."
Michael,"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought."
Captain Jack,He's just sucking up!
Roy,"When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?"
Captain Jack,"Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her."
Jim,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
Roy,"Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!"
Michael,"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?"
Roy,"No, it was Captain Jack."
Michael,"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!"
Captain Jack,"We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!"
Michael,Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
Pam,"No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there."
Michael,Then I'll give you away!
Pam,"No, thank you."
Katy,Do you think that'll ever be us?
Jim,No.
Katy,What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Jim,I don't know. Let's break up.
Katy,Whoa. What?
Captain Jack,This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.
Meredith,Wow!
Dwight,Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Michael,Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
Brenda,Really? What?
Michael,"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a..."
Captain Jack,Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Michael,"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about."
Michael,"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet."
Michael,Is somebody there?
Jim,What happened to you?
Michael,Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
Jim,"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?"
Michael,"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic."
Jim,What a night.
Michael,"Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged."
Jim,She was always engaged.
Michael,Roy said the first one didn't count.
Jim,"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so..."
Michael,"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan..."
Jim,"Yeah, I know."
Michael,"Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute."
Jim,"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway."
Michael,"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up."
Jim,She's engaged.
Michael,BFD. Engaged ain't married.
Jim,Huh.
Michael,"Never, ever, ever give up."
Dwight,"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore."
Michael,"It's a fake wheel, dummy."
Oscar,"...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good."
Jim,You can't lay down.
Jim,"Yeah, that's right."
Dwight,Want to take a rake... .
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
Jim,Wake up.
Michael,Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
Dwight,Ahh!
Pam,"Michael, what's wrong?"
Pam,"Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight."
Michael,"I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!"
Jim,I'm just gonna get...
Pam,"Ok, wait wait wait wait..."
Dwight,"Ok, Pam, thanks."
Michael,"Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!"
Pam,"Get up, get up."
Pam,"Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!"
Dwight,You're the best.
Michael,"No, I want you to pick me up."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,What?
Jim,Just keep him awake.
Pam,Ok...
Dwight,It smells like chicken soup.
Jim,What's going on?
Pam,I know.
Pam,"Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt."
Dwight,I have to go to the hospital.
Michael,I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
Pam,I know.
Jim,I'm sorry? Pam.
Dwight,Where we going?
Pam,
Pam,I just want to say goodbye ok?
Jim,What is going on?
Dwight,"I'll be back, I mean..."
Michael,I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up.
Pam,"Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different."
Michael,OH GOD!
Dwight,Why?
Jim,"Hey, whoa, Michael..."
Pam,It's just hard to explain.
Michael,Oh God!
Dwight,"Aw, Pam, you're adorable"
Jim,"It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened."
Pam,Oh my goodness!
Michael,"OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work."
Dwight,
Jim,You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?
Pam,Come here.
Michael,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that."
Dwight,"Oh, huggy hugs."
Michael,"Pam, could you come get me?!"
Michael,Shotgun!
Pam,"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone."
Jim,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Michael,"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?"
Michael,"The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout ""shotgun"" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion."
Phyllis,"Michael, you should stay home and rest."
Michael,"Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?"
Michael,There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?
Jim,"Well, I think she has a kid."
Kevin,Can you hop?
Michael,"Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around."
Michael,"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
Dwight,Where are we going?
Michael,No one wants to pick me up!?
Jim,"Come on, get inside."
Dwight,What is going on? What is going on?
Dwight,Where are we going?
Pam,"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him."
Jim,We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
Michael,I'm not sick! I'm burned!
Michael,"Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
Dwight,I'm coming Michael!
Jim,"We're going to the hospital, Michael."
Jim,Oh...
Michael,"I know, just sayin'."
Dwight,I'm gonna save you!
Michael,"Dwight, what are you drinking?"
Michael,Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.
Dwight,I found it under the seat.
Dwight,Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Jim,"Oh my God, Dwight, put that down."
Michael,I don't want Dwight!
Dwight,I'm thirsty.
Pam,"Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?"
Jim,Give the bottle to Michael
Michael,I don't have a girlfriend.
Dwight,No!
Jim,But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Jim,Give the bottle to Michael!
Michael,"It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight."
Dwight,I'm thirsty!
Jim,What was that...
Michael,Give it to me.
Pam,What was that?!
Dwight,No.
Jim,Oh!
Michael,Dwight... You just keep your eyes on the road. Give me the bottle or you're fired.
Pam,Ohhhhhh!
Dwight,"You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!"
Jim,He hit the pole!
Michael,Give it to me Dwight.
Jim,"It's broken right, he can't..."
Dwight,No.
Pam,Oh my gosh.
Michael,Give me the bottle!!
Jim,"Oh Dwight, Dwight, Ohhhhhh!"
Jim,Will you stop?
Jim and Pam,Oh my God!
Michael,"Gimme the bottle, Dwight!"
Pam,Is he ok?
Jim,Michael stop.
Jim,"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!"
Dwight,Mmmmm...
Michael,Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
Michael,Just give it!
Michael,"Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through."
Jim,Michael stop.
Pam,"You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate."
Michael,"Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! Gimme the bottle!"
Michael,Did you explain why?
Jim,Stop
Pam,"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot."
Dwight,My eyes!
Michael,"Burned my foot, Pam."
Michael,Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!
Michael,Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.
Dwight,My eyes!
Jim,"So, where are you shipping your foot?"
Michael,"Dwight, what is your middle name."
Michael,Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...
Dwight,Danger.
Dwight,Your foot?
Michael,"Something with a ""K""."
Michael,"Thank you. Pam, messages please?"
Jim,"It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that."
Pam,You didn't have any.
Michael,"What do I write under ""reason for visit""?"
Michael,"Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and..."
Jim,Concussion. What did you write?
Pam,And do my job?
Michael,"Nothing. I wrote ""bringing someone to the hospital""."
Michael,"No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!"
Jim,So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Dwight,It slipped.
Michael,"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him."
Michael,What?
Jim,Come on Dwight.
Dwight,Sorry.
Dwight,Hi Michael!
Pam,"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment."
Michael,Hi Dwight.
Michael,"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask."
Dwight,Ahhh. Mweehaa
Pam,"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy."
Michael,"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
Michael,"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot."
Doctor,A head injury.
Dwight,"Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to."
Michael,"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly."
Michael,What? Part of your duties are to what?
Doctor,"So, I'm ordering a CAT scan."
Dwight,What?
Dwight,What is that?
Michael,"You just said ""part of your duties are to"" something."
Michael,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?"
Dwight,"No, I didn't."
Doctor,"Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot."
Michael,"Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?"
Michael,"Ok, what kinda machine is that?"
Dwight,What is wrong with you?
Doctor,Does the skin look red and swollen?
Michael,Where is my cornbread?
Dwight,That's what she said.
Ryan,Here you go.
Michael,"That's my joke, damnit Dwight."
Michael,Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?
Lab Tech,"Ok, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment..."
Ryan,Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Michael,"It's ok, they're with me."
Michael,Where are the yams?
Lab Tech,No metal of any kind.
Ryan,They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach.
Michael,"Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off."
Michael,Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
Dwight,I don't want to do this.
Ryan,Yes.
Michael,"Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out."
Michael,And they had no yams?
Dwight,Oh.
Ryan,They had no yams.
Michael,Fine. Fine.
Michael,How strange. Because they always have yams.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
Dwight,"Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?"
Jim,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim."
Pam,You've seen one of these?
Pam,"Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?"
Dwight,"Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid."
Jim,"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan."
Pam,Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Pam,I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
Dwight,"Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece."
Jim,Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.
Pam,Really?
Pam,Really? Michael went in with him?
Dwight,"Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!"
Jim,Uh huh.
Pam,"Oh! Ha, haha."
Pam,Wow.
Dwight,"Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan."
Jim,"But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon."
Pam,Pan?
Pam,"Ok, that's uh, good news Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go."
Michael,Pam... PAAAM!?
Jim,Ok.
Pam,"Oh, God."
Pam,Ok. Bye.
Pam,What.
Jim,Bye.
Michael,Come here please.
Pam,"Hey, Oscar?"
Pam,Tell me before I come there.
Oscar,"What's up, Pam?"
Michael,I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Pam,"I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow."
Pam,No.
Oscar,Ok...
Michael,"Pam, please? I have Country Crock."
Pam,"I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that."
Pam,No.
Lab Tech,"Ok Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two, uh Sir? Stop that. Stop. Stop that."
Michael,"Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!"
Dwight,These covers are totally indestructible.
Pam,Really?
Dwight,Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it.
Dwight,"Oh no, it's broken."
Pam,What?!
Dwight,"No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long."
Pam,That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!
Dwight,Yep.
Jim,"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now."
Pam,"Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend!"
Michael,"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?"
Dwight,Huh. Do you like candy?
Angela,It's alright.
Dwight,Cause you're sweeter than candy.
Angela,What is wrong with you?
Angela,Hey!
Toby,"Wow, you just dive right into it."
Ryan,"You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it."
Michael,"No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!"
Toby,"What, what happened?"
Michael,I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
Toby,What do you need?
Michael,"Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam."
Toby,I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
Michael,Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.
Toby,"Ryan, is, uh, dead."
Michael,"No, he's not."
Toby,Dead.
Michael,I just saw him.
Toby,"No. Can't, can't you just get up yourself? I... You only grilled your foot."
Michael,"Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!"
Jim,Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Pam,"No, he's actually been really nice and helpful."
Jim,And that isn't weird?
Pam,Wow...
Michael,"Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?"
Phyllis,"Um, I had scoliosis as a girl."
Michael,"No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
Creed,"When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung."
Michael,"Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles."
Stanley,I'm not disabled and neither are you.
Michael,"Ok, what does this look like to you Stanley?!"
Stanley,"Mailboxes, Etc."
Michael,"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me."
Phyllis,"Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder."
Michael,"I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!"
Dwight,Dad?
Michael,"While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society."
Jim,Quick question
Ryan,Twice.
Michael,Good question. Forrest Gump
Kevin,I think that's from Big.
Michael,"I don't think so, no."
Kelly,"Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia."
Michael,"He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works. A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?"
Stanley,Uh hmmmm... .
Michael,What you mean uh hmmm... ?
Stanley,I mean I'm learning nothing.
Michael,Ok.
Billy Merchant,"Michael Scott, I'm looking for Michael Scott."
Michael,"Yes, right in here, come on in."
Billy Merchant,Great.
Michael,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest."
Billy Merchant,Sorry I'm late. Someone parked in the handicapped parking space.
Billy Merchant,"Hey everyone, I'm Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I'm the properties manager of this office park"
Michael,You are so brave. You are so brave.
Billy Merchant,"Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time..."
Michael,But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
Billy Merchant,"No, I just have a lot of properties to manage."
Michael,"Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?"
Billy Merchant,"I don't know, like 30 seconds?"
Michael,"Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me."
Michael,How did you get in your wheelchair?
Billy Merchant,"This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in."
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny."
Billy Merchant,"Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here."
Michael,"Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor."
Billy Merchant,"Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore."
Michael,"Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?"
Jim,I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Billy Merchant,"So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of..."
Michael,Ok...
Billy Merchant,"First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Yeah? yes..."
Pam,"Dwight, you have your hand up."
Michael,"Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."
Billy Merchant,You know what Michael?
Michael,Yeah...
Billy Merchant,Let me stop you right there.
Michael,Ok.
Billy Merchant,And leave.
Michael,Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
Billy Merchant,What's wrong with that guy?
Jim,You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
Billy Merchant,"No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion."
Michael,Hey!
Ryan,I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
Michael,"You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan."
Ryan,You are very welcome.
Michael,Did you get the yams?
Ryan,"No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!"
Michael,"Ok, I'll just have the pudding."
Ryan,You sure?
Michael,Yeh.
Ryan,Ok.
Michael,You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
Michael,"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain."
Ryan,I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Michael,"Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins."
Dwight,"Uh, ugh, ohhhh..."
Jim,"Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion."
Michael,"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him."
Angela,"He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him."
Michael,Why don't you go with him?
Angela,"I, barely know him..."
Dwight,I want Michael to take me...
Michael,"I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity."
Meredith,You can take my van!
Michael,"Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive."
Jim,Fine.
Michael,"We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please."
Jim,"Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator."
Dwight,Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
Jim,"What are you doing? What, stop..."
Dwight,Vietnam sounds.
Jim,"Stop, stop, stop, stop."
Dwight,Tired...
Jim,Not much what's up with you?
Jim,"Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?"
Pam,"Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. Oh, my God."
Michael,Yeah I'm good.
Michael,"Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me."
Jim,Good.
Jim,"Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?"
Ryan,Creed did you organize the menu book?
Michael,What's up-dog?
Creed,"Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis."
Jim,Nothin' much what's up with you?
Ryan,"No, that was mandatory."
Michael,"Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!"
Creed,"Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing."
Michael,"Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?"
Pam,"Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?"
Stanley,I'm on the phone.
Michael,"Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim."
Michael,"Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog?"
Pam,"Oh, no, that's, you don't have to."
Ryan,What's that?
Michael,"No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend."
Michael,"I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?"
Pam,"No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so."
Ryan,Huh?
Michael,It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Michael,"No, damn it!"
Pam,Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Kevin,What does that mean?
Michael,"Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out."
Michael,What does what mean?
Jim,Ready?
Kevin,The thing you just said?
Pam,Yep.
Michael,Just forget it.
Michael,"People are always coming to me. ""Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust."" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott."
Michael,Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
Dwight,What's up-dog?
Michael,"Gotcha! Oh, God. Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?"
Dwight,Good. How are you doing?
Jim,So close.
Michael,Damn it.
Michael,"Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January"
Dwight,Empty mind.
Michael,"No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say."
Dwight,"Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?"
Angela,He's out sick.
Dwight,That's unacceptable.
Angela,I agree it's unacceptable.
Kevin,Whhh... What are you guys doing?
Dwight,Michael.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,Oscar is out sick.
Michael,On a Friday?
Dwight,Can I do some of the talking?
Michael,I will do all the talking.
Dwight,"Ok, let him know that I'm here."
Oscar,Hello.
Michael,What difference does it make whether your here?
Oscar,Hello?
Michael,"Hi, Oscar its Michael."
Dwight,And Dwight.
Michael,"Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?"
Oscar,Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Michael,"Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic."
Oscar,"Yeah, I feel terrible about it."
Dwight,Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
Michael,What are your symptoms?
Oscar,I have the chills.
Michael,"Umm, hmmm."
Oscar,I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
Dwight,Checks out.
Oscar,Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
Michael,I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.
Oscar,I'll just be sleep---
Dwight,Ok. First impressions?
Michael,He sounded sick.
Dwight,Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Michael,That's exactly what I was thinking.
Dwight,Question? May I investigate?
Michael,Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
Pam,I bought my veil.
Kelly,Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Pam,Ummm...
Kelly,"Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?"
Pam,"Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and..."
Kelly,You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
Michael,"Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier. Man, this must be torture for you."
Jim,Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Jim,Hey Michael.
Michael,Hey Jim-bag.
Jim,Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Michael,Really?
Jim,"Umm, hmm."
Michael,Who else knows?
Jim,Nobody.
Michael,Wow!
Michael,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can."
Michael,My lips are sealed. My lips are sealed... Bangles.
Jim,Alright. Great. Thank you.
Michael,"Can you hear me, they talk about us..."
Dwight,Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?
Ryan,"Yeah, I think I can handle it."
Dwight,Do you think? Or do you know?
Ryan,I think.
Dwight,"Oh God, here."
Michael,"Hey, whatcha gettin'?"
Jim,I'm going with grape.
Michael,"Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?"
Jim,Which one?
Michael,"Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the ""P"" situation?"
Jim,I don't know what you mean.
Michael,P-A-M. P-A
Jim,"Uh, uh, ok."
Michael,"No it's okay, we're talking code."
Stanley,What is?
Michael,Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
Jim,I'm going to take off actually.
Michael,"Alright, well, cool. Still deciding?"
Stanley,Hmm?
Michael,Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
Dwight,"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy."
Dwight,"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful."
Michael,It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
Jim,Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.
Michael,Not so much.
Dwight,"Ok, what is going on here?"
Michael,Nothing.
Dwight,"Oh, really nothing? Fact"
Michael,Fact
Dwight,Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
Jim,"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material."
Dwight,Is that true?
Michael,"Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is."
Dwight,Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.
Michael,Ok.
Dwight,I can tell. I won't let you down.
Michael,Good.
Jim,Thanks.
Michael,"Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?"
Jim,I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Michael,"Oh nonsense, no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat."
Jim,"No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here."
Michael,Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
Jim,"Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out."
Michael,I know just he place.
Michael,"Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?"
Michael,"Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings."
Michael,"Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi."
Dana,Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.
Michael,"We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers."
Jim,Nope we're not brothers.
Michael,I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
Jim,"Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks."
Dana,And for you?
Michael,"Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?"
Dana,"Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce."
Michael,"Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken."
Dana,Is that what you really want?
Michael,"No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog."
Dana,Great.
Dwight,Who took all the black ones?
Pam,That's a communal bowl.
Dwight,"So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?"
Pam,"Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know."
Dwight,Sniffling how?
Pam,Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
Dwight,Three.
Pam,"Ok, it was the second one."
Dwight,"Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?"
Pam,Nuh-uh.
Michael,What do you like best about Pam?
Jim,"Uh, I really don't want to talk about it."
Michael,"Is it her boobs, or..."
Jim,"Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor."
Michael,Really?
Jim,Uh-huh.
Michael,Never get's any of my jokes.
Jim,What about you?
Michael,"Her boobs, definitely."
Jim,"Wow, that's not what I meant."
Dana,Here you go.
Michael,"Oh, thank you."
Dana,And I understand we have a birthday today.
Michael,Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
Dana,Ready girls? Front side.
Hooter's Girls,You put your front side in
Jim,Thank you.
Michael,Woo! Yeah!
Jim,"Thanks, thanks Dana."
Michael,Thank you very much.
Michael,Hilarious. Hey.
Pam,What did you guys talk about?
Jim,"Just you know politics, literature."
Pam,I hate you.
Dwight,Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Michael,Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
Dwight,Including prep time?
Michael,Just do it.
Ryan,If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.
Michael,Expenses.
Kevin,Michael is that a wig?
Michael,No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
Kevin,No.
Angela,This is from Hooters.
Michael,"Yeah, it's a business lunch."
Angela,Did Toby approve this?
Michael,No he did not. I don't need his permission.
Toby,You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Michael,"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?"
Michael,I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
Toby,I'm not processing this.
Michael,"Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?"
Toby,He seems fine to me.
Michael,"You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?"
Kelly,Pam?
Phylis,Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy?
Angela,"It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy."
Kevin,Jim has got it bad for Pam.
Creed,Oh ho! Which one is Pam?
Kevin,Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
Michael,"You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me."
Dwight,"As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved."
Kelly,"Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?"
Jim,Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I don't. Riveting.
Kevin,Nice... she is so hot.
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,Did you find anything good in your desk?
Jim,"Ah, coupon for a free sandwich."
Pam,Score.
Jim,"It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago."
Pam,Big day.
Jim,Big day.
Jim,"Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here."
Pam,Oh.
Jim,"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael."
Pam,Right.
Jim,"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean."
Pam,"No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started."
Jim,Oh you did?
Pam,"No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well."
Jim,"No, no, you saw through me, great."
Pam,So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Jim,"Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay."
Pam,"Mmm, hmm."
Jim,And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Pam,Cool.
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,"Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all."
Gil,Who's this?
Dwight,This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
Gil,Gil.
Oscar,Are you going to tell Michael?
Dwight,How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
Dwight,"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake."
Jim,Hey.
Michael,"I know, I know, I know."
Jim,"Umm, what happened?"
Michael,"I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid."
Jim,"Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal."
Michael,"Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just."
Ryan,What?
Michael,"Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?"
Jim,"Oh, nothing."
Roy,You mean the thing?
Jim,"Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that."
Packer,
Ryan,What?
Michael,Are you kidding me? Oh!
Jim,"Oh, nothing."
Packer,Special delivery!
Ryan,"Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me."
Michael,"That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you."
Michael,Spamster!
Packer,"Sit on the throne, Michael."
Pam,"Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?"
Michael,"Oh. Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!"
Michael,Hamster.
Michael,"It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun. We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out."
Pam,Right.
Jim's voicemail,You have seven unheard messages.
Michael,Welcome back! How was your vacation?
Pam,"Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back!"
Pam,It was great.
Pam,"Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator."
Michael,Yeah?
Pam,"Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert."
Pam,Mm-hm.
Pam,"I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you."
Michael,Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!
Pam,"Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe."
Pam,"Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January."
Pam,"Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow."
Michael,"I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck!"
Pam,"Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk."
Pam,What?
Michael,Wow! What happened in there?
Pam,I don't know.
Michael,"There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?"
Pam,Oh... I don't know.
Michael,Is it a bird?
Pam,"No, I don't think it's a bird."
Michael,"Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet."
Kevin,What's goin' on?
Michael,"Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office."
Kevin,I don't think that's vomit.
Michael,Check it out.
Kevin,Me?
Michael,"Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee."
Kevin,"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Michael,What is it?
Kevin,Michael.
Michael,"What is it? No, just tell me what it is."
Kevin,"Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here. I can't hold my breath that long."
Pam,Open the door up!
Kevin,It smelled terrible.
Pam and others,"Phew. Oh! No, mm-mm."
Michael,I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
Toby,That's no burst pipe.
Michael,"How do you know that? What is it, then?"
Creed,Hi guys. Somebody makin' soup?
Michael,Here she comes. All cleaned? Great.
Dwight,It's still stinky.
Michael,That is worse.
Dwight,She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation.
Michael,"I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um... I can't stand it, I can't stay in here another second. No!"
Jim,Hey! Welcome back!
Pam,Thanks!
Jim,"So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot?"
Pam,A little.
Jim,Good! What's goin' on here?
Jim,What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting.
Ryan,It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. It was not me.
Jim,Oh. Wow.
Pam,
Michael,Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
Jim,That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
Michael,Oh... It's ...
Jim,But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Michael,Yeah ...
Jim,...which I guess I'll be taking.
Michael,"No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing."
Jim,"No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back."
Jim,"Hey, Kelly."
Kelly,Are you moving back here?
Jim,"Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk."
Kelly,"Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy."
Jim,Allergy to... the desk?
Kelly,Weird.
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen."
Dwight,Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
Michael,Don't ape me.
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,This is great.
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,The pressures of my office are insane.
Dwight,Mm.
Michael,"I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here."
Dwight,No way!
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,And who had your office?
Michael,"Ed Truck. Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, ""Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work."" What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away."
Kelly,"I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit..."
Michael,You know who used to sit at that desk?
Dwight,That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Michael,Mm-mm. Todd Packer.
Dwight,No!
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,I thought he was out on the road.
Michael,"He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes."
Dwight,Ah.
Michael,"When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office. Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy."
Michael,I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Stanley,"Excuse me one second, please. What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?"
Michael,"Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. Okay."
Michael,"Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired."
Creed,What did you hit me for?
Michael,Charley horse!
Creed,What?
Michael,Charley horse!
Creed,"You shouldn't have hit me, Michael."
Michael,"Oh, okay. Gah."
Michael,"Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. It was hysterical."
Kelly,"Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones..."
Ryan,"Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair."
Jim,It's the lever on the side.
Ryan,That's what I told him. Thanks.
Kelly,"Oh my God, he is so cute! Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?"
Jim,"No, I don't think I can..."
Kelly,"Oh, please Jim? Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please? He's so cute. I like him so much. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim, please, please, please, please, Jim. Please, please, please..."
Michael,Dwight.
Dwight,Michael.
Michael,Let's send up Accounting.
Dwight,What?
Michael,Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.
Michael,Hey guys.
Oscar,"Hey, Michael."
Michael,Ahem. What's up?
Oscar,"Hey, Dwight."
Michael and Dwight,"Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules!"
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,Yeah! Oh ho ho
Dwight,Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Michael,"No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that."
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,"Watch out, Pam. You're next!"
Pam,You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
Michael,Maybe!
Oscar,"What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it, it makes sense But it... it was still wrong."
Michael,"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her."
Michael,You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.
Dwight,"Hello, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? I'm totally gonna win us that box set."
Michael,Stop.
Dwight,Jethro Tull...
Michael,Stop it. Stop. It. Don't. Don't.
Dwight,I need to make a sales call. Please?
Michael,All right.
Dwight,Am I the 107th caller?
Pam,...back so soon.
Roy,"We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe."
Pam,"Yeah, right."
Roy,"Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something."
Pam,"Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend."
Kelly,"But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it. 'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9"
Pam,Are you kidding?
Roy,No.
Michael,"Hi, guys."
Angela,We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
Michael,I'm just walking around.
Angela,Were you?
Michael,"Well, yeah."
Oscar,"It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael."
Michael,"Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?"
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,"Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?"
Phyllis,You're gonna compete against us?
Michael,"Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!"
Dwight,It is so on!
Michael,"God, this is gonna be fun."
Dwight,Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
Michael,"So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you. Yes! Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale!"
Darryl,What... What's that? Whatcha doing?
Michael,Nothing.
Roy,I think he's dancing.
Michael,No. Just ...
Darryl,That was definitely not dancing.
Michael,"You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just..."
Darryl,Paper business.
Michael,"Yeah, paper business. Is this done?"
Roy,Nope.
Michael,"Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that."
Pam,Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
Creed,Who do you think did it?
Oscar,Are you kidding? I thought it was you.
Creed,Really? I thought you.
Michael,This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.
Michael,You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
Pam,That doesn't seem fair.
Michael,"You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage."
Dwight,But you're the one who picked today.
Michael,I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
Stanley,That's not what a hate crime is.
Michael,"Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . Very well. Then you are all punished."
Pam,What's our punishment?
Michael,You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. No. NO!
Jim,Hey!
Ryan,What's up?
Jim,Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward.
Ryan,What?
Jim,What do you think of Kelly?
Ryan,I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ... Umm... She's really cool.
Jim,Are you interested in her?
Ryan,"Yeah, totally."
Jim,Really?
Ryan,Did she say something?
Jim,She said lots of things.
Ryan,Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Jim,I have no idea.
Ryan,Can you find out?
Jim,Yeah. Sure.
Kelly,"Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?"
Michael,Do you remember Ed Truck?
Creed,Sure. He hired me. How's he doing?
Michael,How would I know?
Creed,I thought you might.
Michael,My biggest fear is turning into him.
Creed,"Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that."
Michael,"I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?"
Michael,Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.
Ed,Yeah. Should we go upstairs?
Michael,"Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now."
Ed,"So, what's the problem with my pension?"
Michael,"Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me."
Ed,"Well, what was done?"
Michael,"I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible."
Ed,"Yeah, somebody once did that in my office."
Michael,Really?
Ed,Yeah.
Michael,"Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?"
Ed,You can't expect to be friends with everybody.
Michael,Well... s-sure I can.
Ed,No. They'll always think of you as a boss first.
Michael,Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.
Ed,I'm not sure that ever happens.
Michael,"Well, okay. Different management styles."
Ed,"Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?"
Michael,"Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, ""Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney."""
Jim,"Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye."
Kelly,You just asked a girl out on the phone!
Jim,Yep.
Michael,Yes.
Todd Packer,"Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott."
Michael,Who is this? How did you get this number?
Packer,"Your mom, you gay nerd!"
Michael,Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?
Todd,"Hey, did you get that package I left for you?"
Michael,Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?
Packer,It was pretty big.
Michael,Really?
Packer,Yeah.
Michael,Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?
Packer,Left it in the middle of your office.
Jan,"So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well."
Jan,I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
Pam,Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
Phyllis,"Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck."
Jan,"Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So..."
Angela,"At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God."
Michael,"Hey, what's going on?"
Jan,Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
Jan,Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Kelly,How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
Michael,Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
Michael,Hi.
Jan,What are you doing?
Jan,Did you take care of the situation?
Michael,"Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads..."
Michael,"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially..."
Jan,Michael.
Jan,Excuse me.
Michael,"No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason."
Michael,I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
Jan,Michael.
Jan,"Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael."
Michael,They did this up in Albany...
Pam,Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
Jan,You are not allowed in this session.
Jim,So you're not doing it.
Michael,And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
Pam,How did you know?
Jan,Now you're really not allowed in this session.
Jim,Why not?
Michael,"Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like..."
Pam,Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Jan,I'm your boss.
Jim,Come on.
Michael,Anybody want any coffee or...
Pam,Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
Jan,"We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please."
Jim,Roy said that.
Michael,"Women in the workplace... yeah, translation ""I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls."" Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!"
Pam,What? You have something you want to say?
Jan,"Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize."
Jim,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?"
Pam,Jan.
Pam,"Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!"
Jan,"Yes, Pam?"
Jim,You are?
Pam,Michael's still at the door.
Pam,Yeah.
Jan,Michael!
Pam,"It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... ."
Jan,So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
Michael,I'm just going to put this over there.
Dwight,It's a terrible idea.
Darryl,This is not a good idea right here.
Jim,What is?
Michael,You did uh... okay.
Dwight,Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Michael,Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?
Michael,"Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!"
Michael,"Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch."
Michael,"Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap."
All the Men,Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.
Michael,Let's just clap. Ready? Yeah! Yeah!
Michael,"Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship."
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,Thank you to our hosts.
Michael,That's what I'm talking about!
Darryl,Hey Michael. This ain't over.
Jan,"I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,"
Michael,Ahhh! Excellent.
Michael,Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
Michael,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
Jan,... but it's very destructive.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please."
Michael,Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Jan,"Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?"
Michael,We have nowhere else Jan. This...
Dwight,We could do it in the warehouse.
Jan,"Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse."
Michael,"OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works."
Michael,"Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months."
Dwight,Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Jan,"I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?"
Pam,Mmmhmm.
Jan,Please? Thank you. very much.
Michael,"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?"
Darryl,My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Michael,"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing."
Roy,Why?
Michael,Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
Roy,I don't understand.
Michael,Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
Kevin,I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
Jim,"Thanks for the head's up, Kev."
Kevin,I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
Michael,"Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little ""Good Will Hunting"" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind."
Jan,Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
Meredith,Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
Jan,Great. Phyllis?
Phyllis,"I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that."
Angela,Really?
Phyllis,I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
Jan,No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
Angela,I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
Phyllis,Really? I thought they were pretty...
Pam,I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Roy,"Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam."
Jim,"Oh, no, no. No."
Roy,"No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?"
Jim,Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
Roy,"You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home."
Jim,Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Roy,"So, we're cool, right?"
Jim,Yes. Yeah.
Roy,All right.
Jim,"Yep. Cool, man."
Roy,Sweet.
Kevin,
Darryl,"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today."
Michael,"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there."
Darryl,The experience...
Michael,Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
Dwight,Okay. Let's go. Step up.
Michael,Check this out! Look at that! Look at that bwup-bwa! Hello! How are... Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
Meredith,"In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober."
Jan,That is an excellent goal.
Meredith,Four and a half.
Kelly,I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
Jan,Great! Uh-huh?
Kelly,I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Women,
Jan,"Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life."
Dwight,Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
Jim,Ponies.
Dwight,No.
Ryan,How about rainbows?
Dwight,No.
Jim,Flowers.
Darryl,"It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this."
Michael,"Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself."
Darryl,Mike.
Michael,Stand clear.
Darryl,Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
Michael,"I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine."
Darryl,"Look, would ya... look."
Michael,"Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up."
Darryl,We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Lonny,"Dammit, Michael!"
Michael,We ought to have this thing serviced.
Michael,"So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so..."
Madge,"Hey, do you want me to go?"
Michael,"No, why? Why would I... ? You could..."
Madge,I'll go.
Michael,Stay or...
Phyllis,...and a big walk-in closet.
Meredith,"Oh, that's part of my dream too."
Kelly,"Oh, me too."
Jan,"Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?"
Pam,"Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way."
Phyllis,She's real good.
Pam,Thanks.
Jan,You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
Pam,"Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off..."
Jan,"Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out."
Pam,"Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um..."
Jan,There are always a million reasons not to do something.
Michael,"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?"
Darryl,My priority is safety.
Michael,OK.
Darryl,"So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin."
Michael,"OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh..."
Darryl,Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
Michael,I... That was just...
Darryl,That bothers me too.
Michael,I was breathing.
Roy,Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
Michael,"I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men."
Lonny,"You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?"
Michael,OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
Jan,All right. Let's talk about clothing.
Phyllis,I'm excited about today. I love girl talk.
Jan,"Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be."
Angela,"I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore."
Roy,"I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like ""When are we going to go on a date-date?"""
Guy,I hate that too!
Darryl,I hate that too.
Kevin,That sucks so much.
Guy,It totally sucks.
Dwight,"Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like ""Gas ain't free!"""
Lonny,"Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires."
Michael,I feel you.
Darryl,"No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?"
Dwight,Not literally.
Darryl,"You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently."
Michael,Yes.
Darryl,We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
Michael,"Ah, you do. So..."
Darryl,But we get paid a lot less.
Dwight,Word.
Roy,Like next to no benefits.
Michael,I know. God! What is that?
Roy,Exactly.
Michael,"It blows. It blows, man. Gah..."
Darryl,You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Roy,That's what I'm talking about.
Michael,"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah."
Roy,Absolutely.
Darryl,That's what we need.
Guy,You know you're right.
Darryl,"Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally."
Michael,You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
Darryl,"It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?"
Roy,In my truck.
Michael,Dockworker's?
Darryl,"Man, hook you up."
Men,
Guy,"Come on, man."
Michael,Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
Darryl,"Union! Union, yeah."
Michael,The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Darryl,Are you with us Mike?
Michael,Yeah-es.
Darryl,Welcome to the warehouse.
Group chant,"Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi..."
Jan,Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
Michael,"This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points..."
Jan,What? A union! What...
Michael,Don't get hysterical.
Jan,I'm not...
Michael,Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
Michael,Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
Jan,"The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?"
Michael,Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
Jan,"You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out."
Michael,But we're bonding down there!
Jan,That's too bad.
Michael,I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
Jan,I don't want to...
Michael,Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
Jan,Michael! Michael! Michael!
Michael,We have a history...
Jan,Michael.
Michael,...between us.
Jan,Don't say another word.
Michael,I won't
Jan,Get yourself down stairs.
Michael,I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
Ryan,You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Stanley,This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
Jan,"Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means..."
Phyllis,Mistake.
Meredith,Slip.
Jan,"Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense."
Kelly,What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
Jan,Excuse me?
Kelly,"I mean that's a baseball term, right?"
Jan,I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
Kelly,...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
Jan,"Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about."
Kelly,He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey!
Pam,How's it going down there?
Jim,"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?"
Pam,Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
Jim,Did you really?
Pam,No.
Jim,Oh.
Pam,Almost.
Jim,Good.
Pam,"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great."
Jim,"Nice. Well, what's it all about?"
Pam,Um...
Jim,I think you should do it. That's great!
Pam,It's really cool.
Michael,"Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?"
Angela,Are you married?
Jan,I'm divorced.
Phyllis,That must have been hard.
Jan,It was. Yes.
Kelly,You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
Pam,"I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and..."
Pam,Phyllis.
Delivery man,Would you sign here?
Pam,"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big."
Meredith,"""Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."""
Phyllis,Isn't he sweet?
Meredith,Yeah. Wow.
Michael,"Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO."
Dwight,And you want me to come with you.
Michael,Nope. The opposite of that.
Dwight,I will stay here and run things on this end.
Michael,"Ok, good."
Dwight,Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Michael,"I probably will, why do you ask?"
Dwight,"Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know..."
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,Screwed.
Michael,What is your problem?
Michael,"This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love."
Michael,"Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?"
Pam,That's OK.
Michael,Alright.
Oscar,"The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO."
Michael,"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!"
Michael,"Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name."
Jim,"So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great."
Dwight,What's this? What is this?
Jim,"I dunno, it's on your desk."
Dwight,"Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?"
Jim,It was there when I sat down.
Dwight,Happy Valentine's Day. It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! Ahh!
Michael,"The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice."
Jim,Hey Kelly. What's up?
Kelly,"Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome."
Jim,"OH, that's great. I'm really happy for"
Kelly,"And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like ""Ryan, what's taking you so long?"" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say."
Jim,Wow.
Kelly,"So I said, ""Ryan, what took you so long?"" And I just said that to him, can you believe that?"
Jim,Wow.
Kelly,"Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed."
Jim,"No, don't be."
Kelly,"Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe."
Jim,I bet.
Kelly,"So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend."
Jim,Alright.
Ryan,I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Michael,"Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here."
Kevin,Woah.
Pam,Guess what?
Phyllis,"Really, Oh, they're from Bob again."
Pam,That's great.
Michael,"Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there."
Michael,"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were, OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh."
Dwight,"Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten."
Angela,"Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it."
Dwight,Oh I did. I did.
Angela,I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
Dwight,"Oh, I bet you will before the day is over."
Angela,"Really? Well, I hope I do."
Michael,"I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it."
Jim,"Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye."
Kevin,"Woah, woah"
Delivery man,Phyllis Lapin.
Pam,"OH, Holy God!"
Delivery man,It's from Bob.
Kevin,"Man, that thing's bigger than I am."
Delivery man,"No, it's not."
Kevin,Oh zip it.
Michael,There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
Craig,Hey.
Josh,Michael Scott.
Michael,"Josh Porter, high five. Bam."
Josh,You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
Michael,"Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers."
Craig,What's up buddy?
Michael,"You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?"
Craig,"Guilty, yeah."
Michael,So what's going on? What I miss?
Josh,"Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations."
Michael,"Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and..."
Dwight,"Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?"
Pam,"You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here."
Dwight,"No, Pam, Just. Just,"
Pam,You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Dwight,"Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of..."
Pam,Tightly wound?
Dwight,(smirking) Exactly.
Pam,"Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is."
Dwight,"You mean, like a ham?"
Pam,"No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her."
Dwight,"Ok, I get it."
Pam,That you remember her.
Dwight,"Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do."
Josh,"What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?"
Craig,"Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said ""You gotta fire four people,"" and I was just like, ""What?"" Ya know?"
Josh,Did you?
Craig,"No, I just ignored her. She's the worse."
Josh,She is our boss.
Craig,She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.
Michael,"Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it."
Craig,What? You like Jan? How can you like Jan?
Michael,"Maybe because she's my girlfriend. Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and..."
Josh,You hooked up with Jan?
Michael,"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,"
Josh,"Yeah, let's change the subject."
Michael,"Yeah, yeah."
Kelly,"I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever."
Jim,Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need...
Ryan,Soda.
Kelly,"Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or..."
Jim,"Oh, no, not while I'm here."
Kelly,"I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So..."
Ryan,I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Kelly,"OK, That's cool. I completely understand."
Ryan,Cool. Cool. OK.
Jan,"Josh Porter, Stamford."
David,David
Josh,Nice to meet you.
Jan,"And Michael Scott, Scranton."
David,Nice to meet you.
Michael,Ditto. How are you Jan?
Jan,Fine Michael. Thank you.
David,OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Jan,"Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous."
Josh,"So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets."
David,Thanks very much.
Josh,Thank you.
David,"OK, Michael."
Michael,"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more."
Michael,"Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on."
Michael,"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about."
Michael,"And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home."
Michael,Questions?
David,"Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great."
Michael,"Yes, thank you."
David,"But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?"
Michael,"Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm..."
Delivery man,Can you sign?
Pam,Yeah.
Pam,Oscar.
Angela,Nothing for me?
Pam,Join the club.
Kevin,Whose it from?
Oscar,My mom.
Kelly,"It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together."
Jim,"You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't."
Kelly,"Yeah, it would be so great if he was."
Jim,"Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight."
Kelly,"Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan?"
Dan,"And that about does it, thank you."
Jan,"OK. Craig,"
Craig,Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.
Jan,"Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?"
Craig,"I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal."
David,"So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?"
Craig,"That is correct, yes."
Jan,"Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?"
Craig,"Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know."
Jan,"Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch."
Craig,"Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too."
Michael,"Oh, ok. Alright."
Jan,"NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired."
Michael,No you're not.
Jan,"Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together."
Michael,"Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So..."
Jan,"Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?"
Michael,Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
Jan,"Surely, you cannot be serious?"
Michael,I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
Dwight,"Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving."
Roy,Hey babe.
Pam,Hey.
Roy,You almost ready to go?
Pam,"I guess, yeah."
Roy,What's wrong?
Pam,"Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her."
Roy,"What, you're mad at me?"
Pam,"I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day."
Roy,"Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best s*x of you life."
David,You understand this is a very serious situation.
Michael,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously."
David,You made a joke?
Michael,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool."
David,Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Michael,"I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again."
Jan,"Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it."
David,Good.
Pam,Heading out?
Jim,"Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day."
Pam,Bye.
Phyllis,Goodnight Pam.
Pam,Night Phyllis.
Jan,"Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice."
Michael,"Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again."
Jan,"Oh, no, it's OK. So, uh, Happy valentine's Day."
Michael,"Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day."
Jan,Oh.
Michael,Oy vey... schmear.
Michael,Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
Dwight,They are either going to say yes... or no.
Michael,Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Dwight,Think it through.
Michael,Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
Jim,Can we not?
Michael,"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted."
Jim,Still want that.
Michael,"Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me."
Creed,Ryan!
Dwight,Fumble! Yaaah!
Michael,"Hey, Dwight."
Dwight,Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Michael,You all right Ryan?
Dwight,Ryan.
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,Pam!
Dwight,"Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?"
Jim,Cugino's pizza.
Dwight,"Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question"
Jim,"Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so..."
Jim,What did I do to deserve this?
Pam,Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
Jim,No.
Pam,"Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?"
Phyllis,"Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?"
Pam,Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
Phyllis,Oh.
Jim,"Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later."
Pam,"Ok, cool."
Pam,I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Michael,That's what she said!
Dwight,Ha! I don't get it.
Michael,Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Dwight,"Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?"
Michael,"Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life."
Michael,"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year."
Dwight,"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, ""Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..."""
Michael,That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
Dwight,"When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'."
Dwight,I can't do this.
Michael,"That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time."
Dwight,"Oh, okay."
Michael,But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
Dwight,"Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked."
Michael,"Well, if you have a question, you should ask me."
Dwight,I'll try and think of one. When...
Michael,Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
Dwight,Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Michael,Insult.
Pam,"Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my..."
Jim,"Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?"
Jim,I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Jim,Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Oscar,"I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care."
Michael,"But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?"
Dwight,Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.
Michael,"It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class."
Dwight,But I'm right?
Michael,"Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!"
Dwight,Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Michael,I do. Both of them.
Dwight,Could I have a copy of one of them?
Michael,"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this."
Michael,Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,Congratulations.
Phyllis,Unbelievable.
Michael,"You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them."
Dwight,That is so great about the bonus!
Michael,"No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience."
Stanley,Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Phyllis,It's unbelievable!
Dwight,Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Pam,Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Dwight,Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Stanley,Why would this affect our bonuses?
Dwight,They are unrelated.
Kelly,Is Brad okay?
Dwight,"He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing."
Oscar,What the hell is going on here?
Angela,Are we out of jobs?
Dwight,Yes.
Kelly,This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Michael,He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Stanley,Michael?
Michael,Yeah.
Stanley,You said we were getting bonuses.
Michael,All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
Stanley,Cancel wallpaper.
Michael,"As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking."
Pam,You mean Toastmasters?
Michael,"Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast."
Pam,"Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?"
Jim,Can I go?
Michael,Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Jim,So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Kevin,You should go to Hedonism.
Jim,What is that?
Kevin,"It's like Club Med, but everything is naked."
Jim,"I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice."
Toby,Been to Amsterdam.
Michael,Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Toby,To Amsterdam.
Jim,When did you go there?
Toby,Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
Jim,Really for like how long?
Toby,"Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't..."
Creed,"Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me."
Jim,Where do I want to go?
Creed,I'd send you to Hong Kong.
Creed,Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China.
Michael,"Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today."
Dwight,"Good morning, Vietnam! Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates."
Jim,No. We're not.
Dwight,"Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager."
Jim,Which means absolutely nothing.
Dwight,"Michael, can you explain?"
Michael,"Well, it's mostly made up. So..."
Michael,Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Michael,"Confidence, Dwight."
Jim,Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Dwight,I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Jim,Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Dwight,Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
Jim,You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Dwight,You did?
Jim,Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Dwight,Yes. I am.
Jim,"The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did."
Dwight,Which is?
Jim,You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Jim,"Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one. Originally given by Benito Mussolini."
Jim,"Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind."
Dwight,I'll glance at it.
Michael,"It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here."
Angela,"The very best of luck to you, Dwight."
Dwight,"Thank you, Angela."
Kelly,Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Pam,Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
Ryan,You're inviting Jim?
Pam,Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Michael,All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
Overhead,You all ready for this?
Angela,I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
Kevin,"I've never, ever seen you take a sick day."
Angela,"Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us."
Speaker,"Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, Dwight Schrute!"
Crowd,
Michael,"Dwight, they called your name."
Speaker,"Dwight, how we doing?"
Dwight,"No, I can't... I ca..."
Michael,All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. All right!
Crowd,
Michael,"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?"
Kevin,I always set it at 69.
Pam,Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Kelly,"But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?"
Ryan,"Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married."
Kelly,Oh.
Pam,"Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just..."
Ryan,I know what I said.
Michael,"I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. Michael Winslow, anyone?"
Michael,"Car starting. All right, Dwight Schrute everyone."
Crowd,
Michael,Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
Dwight,"Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle. A never-ending fight. I say to you and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!"
Crowd,
Dwight,WE ARE WARRIORS!
Crowd,
Dwight,"Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!"
Crowd,
Dwight,Yeah. Yes!
Oscar,I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Jim,Maybe. Thanks.
Ryan,You really think you're going to go?
Jim,Yeah. I'm definitely going.
Ryan,Nice. Send me a postcard.
Ryan,"Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia."
Dwight,No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.
Crowd,
Dwight,"Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is..."
Crowd,Together that we prevail!
Pam,Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
Jim,"I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable."
Pam,That's awesome. Where are you staying?
Jim,I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Pam,When are you leaving?
Jim,I'm... leaving on June 8th.
Pam,Oh.
Jim,"Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just..."
Pam,Oh yeah. That's too bad.
Jim,Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Pam,It's ok. I got it.
Jim,Alright.
Dwight,"Ok, thanks. There you are. What happened?"
Michael,I got thirsty. How'd it go?
Dwight,It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
Michael,You would not believe what happened here.
Dwight,What? Something happened?
Michael,"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35."
Dwight,Weird.
Michael,"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'"
Dwight,Con artist.
Michael,She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Michael,"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?"
Pam,"I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel."
Pam,"Yeah, I get to do this like, every week."
Jim,Bribery. Nice.
Jake,That's so awesome!
Pam,"Oh, I have more."
Pam,I know.
Michael,Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Michael,"Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at."
Pam,"Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. 'Cause of the..."
Kevin,Go ahead.
Michael,"... Oh, God is that today?"
Abby,Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
Pam,I reminded you last night.
Jim,"Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time?"
Michael,"Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in ""Raw,"" and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in ""Daddy Daycare."" both great movies, but, still."
Kevin,What're you doing? You never have plans.
Michael,"Well, I'll be in my office."
Jim,"Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date."
Pam,Don't you think you should say something?
Kevin,Niiice.
Michael,They're cool.
Michael,"Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do."
Pam,"Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---"
Michael,You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
Michael,"Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City."
Jim,Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Jim and Dwight,That's Batman.
Pam,I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.
Michael,"Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?"
Michael and Dwight,...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams...
Jim,The ocean.
Pam,My theory is that...
Michael,I work with a bunch of nerds.
Michael and Dwight,...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...
Dwight,Mmm... hello tiny one.
Dwight,"And they do, your parents, love you very much."
Toby,Come on.
Michael,One more time. You...
Dwight,You are the future!
Dwight,"The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. They didn't eat the children."
Kevin,This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Kevin,"Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check."
Stanley,"Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa."
Michael,"Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her."
Melissa,I'm in eighth grade.
Michael,Oh.
Stanley,She's in middle school.
Michael,"Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time."
Michael,"It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle."
Michael,They want how many spiral pads?
Meredith,"Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order."
Michael,Okay.
Meredith,"I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter."
Angela,Can you put that down there?
Kelly,Yep.
Toby,"Okay, tell them what you wanted to say."
Sasha,Do you need any help?
Angela,"No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves."
Toby,"Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw."
Kelly,"Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?"
Angela,"I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys."
Kelly,God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Ryan,"Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me."
Michael,"Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow."
Pam,"Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool."
Abby,No thanks.
Pam,I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
Jim,What are you reading?
Abby,From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.
Jim,"Aww, best book?"
Abby,"Yeah, but I've read it before."
Jim,"Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?"
Abby,Definitely the Aquarium.
Jim,"Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped."
Abby,Sure.
Jim,Really?
Abby,Mmhmm!
Jim,"Yesss. And you're Abby, right?"
Abby,Yeah.
Jim,I'm Jim. Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Abby,Alright.
Jim,Let's start with... your mom.
Michael,"Yes. Well... we can... uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?"
Sasha,Sasha.
Michael,Nice to meet you.
Sasha,Ooh!
Michael,"Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? You want to try?"
Sasha,Sure.
Michael,"All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!"
Jim,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand."
Dwight,There is no way that hurt.
Jim,"Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight."
Dwight,"Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?"
Jake,Do you have any computer games?
Dwight,"No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate."
Jake,"Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here."
Dwight,You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Jake,"Whatever, okay?"
Dwight,You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
Jake,That's your name? Mister Poop?
Dwight,Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Jake,"Sure, Mister Poop."
Dwight,... Schrute.
Sasha,Are you Mother Goose?
Melissa,"I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else."
Ryan,Wow.
Melissa,"There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there?"
Ryan,No.
Melissa,"You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you are so dorky. Gimme your number, so I can text you."
Ryan,Uhm...
Melissa,Come on! You have an email address?
Kelly,...that I thought you should know ...
Stanley,Mmhmm. What?
Kelly,I think something a little fishy is going on.
Stanley,A little fishy?
Kelly,"Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ..."
Stanley,"That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!"
Ryan,"Yes, I--"
Stanley,"Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!"
Ryan,Okay.
Ryan,Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Dwight,"That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!"
Michael,Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight,There's a photo...
Michael,What the hell are you reading to them?
Dwight,"These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---"
Michael,"Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you."
Sasha,What's a Nazi?
Michael,What's a Nazi?
Dwight,Nazi was a fascist movement...
Michael,Don't!
Dwight,...from the 1930's...
Michael,"Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?"
Dwight,I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Michael,Why don't you just leave? Okay?
Dwight,...Okay.
Jake,"Bye, Mister Poop."
Michael,"Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?"
The Kids,"I do, I do!"
Michael,"Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool."
Angela,"You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities."
Michael,"This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?"
Melissa,So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
Michael,"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it."
Abby,That's not fair.
Michael,"Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate..."
Jake,You're just a middleman.
Michael,I'm not just a middle... man...
Melissa,"Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?"
Michael,"You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business."
Dwight,We have better service than they do!
Michael,"...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?"
Creed,That is correct.
Michael,Say hi to the kids.
Creed,Hi kids.
Michael,Yaaaaay.
Creed,Have you ever seen a foot with four toes?
Kids,Ewwww!
Michael,"What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?"
Creed,"Th-the hair covers it, mostly."
Michael,"No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?"
Michael,"You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show."
Kids,No way.
Michael,It's true. I did.
Melissa,You serious?
Jake,Really?
Michael,I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
Abby,That doesn't sound like a show.
Melissa,What?!
Michael,"It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. Ryan, can you come here a second? I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar."
Ryan,Right. Okay.
Michael,I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Ryan,"Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so..."
Melissa,"You know, I can go with him."
Michael,Oka--
Ryan,No! I will... go.
Michael,"Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office."
Michael,"Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?"
Michael,"I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake."
Michael,"I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?"
Miss Trudy,"...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? Let's have some fun!"
Michael,"That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to..."
Dwight,Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Michael,"Stop! Stop! Stop! Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow."
Jim,That's pretty funny.
Michael,Yeah.
Edward R. Meow,"...Recess! Hey, what's your name?"
Chet,My name's Chet.
Edward R. Meow,Well hi Chet.
Oscar,Is that Chet Montgomery?
Michael,"Uhh, I don't know."
Pam,That is!
Darryl,Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
Edward R. Meow,What do you want to be when you grow up?
Chet,I want to be on TV!
Dwight,And he is on TV now!
Michael,"Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it."
Edward R. Meow,"Okay, next? So, whats your name?"
Michael,Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
Edward R. Meow,Well what's your favorite subject at school?
Young Michael,Recess.
Edward R. Meow,"Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?"
Young Michael,"I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend."
Edward R. Meow,"Uh, ah... oh, okay! Well uh, nice talking with you, Michael. Uh, back to you Miss Trudy!"
Miss Trudy,"Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day."
Michael,Coulda sworn there was...
Melissa,Did you get married?
Michael,"...uh, no."
Abby,Why not?
Michael,"Uh, just never happened."
Sasha,"So, do you have any kids?"
Michael,"Uh, nope."
Jake,Do you have a girlfriend?
Michael,I do okay.
Melissa,Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?
Michael,Yes.
Jake,Even I have a girlfriend.
Michael,"Okay! Alright, okay."
Sasha,So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.
Michael,"...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye."
Pam,He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
Jim,"Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy."
Roy,Pam! Pam! I love this guy! Come on!
Pam,"So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice."
Melissa,Who? Terry?
Pam,Mmhmm.
Melissa,That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother.
Jake,"Mister Poop, I have to tell you something."
Dwight,"Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name."
Jake,You're ugly.
Dwight,Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Jake,Meredith!
Michael,Yeah?
Toby,I think these belong to you.
Michael,"Oh, that's okay, she can keep those."
Toby,"Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch."
Michael,Thank you.
Toby,Is everything okay?
Michael,You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Toby,Uh... it's true...
Michael,"Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost."
Toby,Mmhmm.
Michael,"Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?"
Toby,"Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend."
Michael,What about...
Toby,Not Jan.
Michael,...Jan. Kay.
Toby,"If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something."
Michael,...Or biologically.
Toby,Somehow.
Michael,"Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I..."
Toby,Yes.
Michael,Oh... kay.
Jake,Is it okay if I take one?
Pam,Sure.
Jake,Thank you.
Pam,You're welcome.
Jake,Is your job hard?
Pam,"It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?"
Jake,Yeah!
Pam,Really?
Jake,Yeah.
Pam,Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. Cool huh?
Jake,"That's so cool, yeah!"
Michael,"So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you."
Michael,Yeah.
Oscar,Who is this guy again?
Pam,This is from all of us.
Michael,Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
Michael,Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
Ryan,Who uses calling cards anymore?
Pam,Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
Michael,"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend."
Oscar,This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Michael,Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Toby,"Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?"
Michael,"You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. Alright."
Jim,"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?"
Michael,"Alright, let me explain. Again. Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... ... I have to go make a call."
Pam,Happy birthday Michael.
Michael,Oh ho ho! What?
Pam,I said happy birthday.
Michael,Thank you! That's really nice.
Michael,"Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect ice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher."
Michael,What's up?
Jim,"Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday."
Michael,"Ah, thank you sir."
Meredith,Did you hear anything yet?
Kevin,No. I'm still waiting.
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,"Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!"
Michael,"Ohh, god."
Dwight,Birthday hug!
Michael,"No no no, no, new suit, please."
Dwight,That suit is amazing.
Michael,"Thank you very much. It is from Italy. Actually--- no, Bulgaria."
Dwight,Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Michael,Good luck. One of a kind.
Dwight,Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Michael,"Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday."
Dwight,"Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the..."
Michael,"Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise."
Dwight,Let's get the party started.
Michael,Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you!
Phyllis,"When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?"
Pam,One's good.
Angela,"One thirty. I'm sorry, are we boring you?"
Dwight,"Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority."
Phyllis,Where do we get those?
Dwight,Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by.
Pam,Michael wants a strippergram?
Dwight,"Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom."
Angela,No. This is a closed door meeting.
Michael,Yeah?
Pam,"Michael, I have Jan on the line."
Michael,"Oh, great, put her through."
Jan,"Hello, Michael."
Michael,"Hey, you."
Jan,"I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent."
Michael,"It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday."
Jan,"Well, today's not my birthday, so..."
Michael,"Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday."
Jan,"...Happy birthday, Michael."
Michael,Thanks.
Jan,Am I on camera?
Michael,Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.
Michael,"...You can take a five, if you want."
Michael,Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
Stanley,"Mmhmm, happy birthday."
Michael,Thanks.
Jim,"Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?"
Kevin,They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Jim,"Oh, okay."
Kelly,Second opinion on what?
Kevin,"Um, I might have skin cancer."
Kelly,"Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and he had skin cancer too."
Jim,"Kelly, you know what..."
Kelly,I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Toby,Who brought in donuts?
Michael,Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Toby,Happy birthday!
Michael,You didn't know it was my birthday.
Toby,I... guess I forgot.
Michael,"Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut."
Toby,Are you serious?
Michael,Mmm.
Oscar,Skin cancer is treatable.
Kevin,Right.
Oscar,It's going to be okay.
Angela,"You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though."
Delivery Woman,"Hi, delivery for Michael Scott."
Michael,"Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?"
Delivery Woman,Uh... s-sure.
Michael,Okay. I'm so nervous.
Pam,I can sign for it.
Delivery Woman,Oh. Thanks.
Michael,"When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday."
Michael,Stop it. Stop! What is that?
Dwight,"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song."
Michael,"Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything."
Dwight,I probably care more than she does.
Michael,You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this.
Pam,When does he hear?
Jim,Sometime today.
Pam,Ohh... poor Kevin.
Pam,"If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week."
Dwight,"Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on back... order... Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!"
Michael,What?
Dwight,Listen up everyone! It is 11
Michael,"Ohhh, God."
Dwight,There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Michael,"Ohhh, no."
Dwight,So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Oscar,...I'll do it.
Michael,"Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this."
Dwight,Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Pam,...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Jim,"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and..."
Dwight,"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?"
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,"Happy birth moment, Michael."
Michael,Thank you.
Dwight,One. Two. Three!
Michael,Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
Dwight,Oscar...
Oscar,It wasn't me.
Dwight,"Okay, that is not an eight foot sub."
Delivery Boy,"Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs."
Dwight,"F. Alright, what's the damage?"
Delivery Boy,"Uh, thirty-nine sixty."
Dwight,Thirty nine... sixty.
Dwight,"Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones."
Dwight,Here they come.
Michael,Get in here... everybody.
Dwight,Come and get it!
Michael,Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
Oscar,What is this?
Dwight,"Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup."
Michael,The best.
Stanley,These are all the same?
Michael,Yes.
Angela,Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
Michael,"Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good."
Angela,No.
Michael,"Just the bread, it's fresh baked."
Angela,No.
Michael,Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. And choke on it.
Michael,"When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... That was the worst birthday I think I ever had."
Jim,"So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back."
Pam,Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
Jim,"Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number."
Pam,And his favorite lunch.
Dwight,"Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left."
Ryan,Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Dwight,"Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake."
Angela,Oh. Thank you.
Dwight,Oh. I got it.
Angela,What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
Dwight,This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Angela,Fine.
Dwight,What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Angela,Yes... but don't expect any cookie.
Dwight,But what if i'm hungry?
Angela,No cookie.
Jim,...What?
Pam,You use fabric softener?
Jim,"Yeah, you don't?"
Pam,"No, I do."
Jim,...Okay.
Office Staff,"Happy birthday dear Michael, Happy birthday... ...tooo youuuu."
Kevin,Hello? Hey.
Michael,Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Kevin,"No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. It was just Stacy."
Michael,Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Dwight,Here we go. Make a wish.
Michael,Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...
Dwight,Yaoo yay!
Michael,... I asked for trick candles.
Dwight,Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Michael,"Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day."
Angela,No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Michael,"... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us."
Pam,We should probably head back.
Jim,Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Pam,You dare me? How old are you?
Jim,Just... quit stalling.
Pam,"Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner."
Jim,Such a dork.
Pam,"Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you..."
Store Employee,Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.
Pam,Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Jim,How old are you?
Pam,I hate you.
Toby,"Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible."
Michael,There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Kevin,Still scary.
Michael,"Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is."
Kevin,Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Michael,And laughter... also.
Toby,I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
Michael,Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
Toby,I work here.
Michael,"Nyeh, I work here. Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day."
Kevin,"If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy."
Michael,"Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry."
Dwight,"Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls."
Jim,"Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael."
Dwight,"Please, don't."
Jim,You... owe me.
Michael,"Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun."
Stanley,Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Michael,How dare you sir. You are gross.
Michael,That should not be there.
Dwight,I'll get someone to take it down.
Michael,"No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!"
Kelly,Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
Ryan,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Jim,Think you can let go?
Pam,No.
Jim,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Dwight,YEAH!
Pam,Who is that?
Jim,Is that Michael?
Michael,"Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids."
Pam,I got it.
Michael,"Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it."
Jim,...It's something to think about.
Kevin,"I can't relax about it, you know?"
Michael,Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Kevin,"No, not yet."
Michael,Okay. Well. Live strong.
Kevin,"Okay, Michael."
Michael,Alright.
Carol,Michael?
Michael,"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or..."
Carol,"Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson."
Michael,"Oh, these... all your kids?"
Carol,No just the front two.
Michael,"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?"
Carol,Sure.
Michael,Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Michael,Push. Good! That's great. You got it. Excuse me.
Kevin,"Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. It was negative."
Michael,"Oh... God... God! We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here."
Michael,"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos."
Kevin,"This is awesome. Thanks, you guys."
Michael,"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!"
Dwight,Turn it around. Turn it around.
Michael,Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Dwight,Number one!!
Michael,Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Pam,Michael?
Dwight,"Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit... Okay, come on, let's go."
Jim,"You look cute today, Dwight."
Dwight,"Thanks, girl."
Jim,"So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs."
Dwight,"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like"
Kevin,Hey...
Dwight,"I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't."
Jim,I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Pam,"Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can."
Kelly,"And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said ""Is it okay if I sip it?"" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way."
Dwight,"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?"
Kelly,Six.
Dwight,I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Ryan,I go to a lot of parties.
Dwight,"Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys."
Ryan,I am not giving you my keys.
Dwight,Don't make me do this the hard way.
Ryan,What's the hard way?
Dwight,"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him."
Ryan,"Yeah, let's do it that way."
Michael,"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow."
Dwight,I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Jim,Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Dwight,I volunteered for this job.
Jim,And that's not the same.
Dwight,It is my duty...
Jim,Volunteer duty.
Dwight,...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Michael,Narc!
Kevin,
Dwight,If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
Michael,I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
Dwight,"Well, you have..."
Michael,"Uuf, well..."
Dwight,...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Michael,Okay...
Dwight,...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Michael,"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!"
Jim,"Well, your office is behind you."
Michael,Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
Ryan,I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Dwight,Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Dwight,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
Oscar,"No, I have not."
Dwight,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
Oscar,What are you implying?
Dwight,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
Oscar,Okay. I'm done with this.
Dwight,He sure left in a hurry.
Dwight,I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Dwight,Do you know what this is?
Phyllis,"Yes, it's marijuana."
Dwight,How do you know that?
Phyllis,It's labeled.
Dwight,Dammit.
Creed,That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
Dwight,"No, it's marijuana."
Jim,I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Dwight,"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me."
Jim,"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember."
Dwight,I would remember.
Jim,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?"
Dwight,That's not how it works.
Jim,Now how do you know how it works?
Dwight,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you."
Jim,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Dwight,
Oscar,"So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it."
Jim,"Oh, um... Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?"
Stanley,Is that supposed to be me?
Jim,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression."
Stanley,I do not think that is funny.
Pam,He does everyone in the office.
Stanley,Hmmmpt.
Pam/Jim,I do not think that is funny.
Pam,Jinx! Buy me a coke.
Jim,Oh...
Pam,"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid."
Pam,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Jim,C'mon!
Pam,"Sorry, that's not my problem."
Jim,
Dwight,"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently."
Angela,I understand.
Dwight,Where were you yesterday after work?
Angela,
Michael,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?
Kevin,"That is so good, Michael"
Michael,"Remember the narc bit? Uh-oh, who's in trouble?"
Dwight,Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Michael,Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Dwight,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Oscar,"Is that true, Toby?"
Toby,"Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing."
Michael,"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it."
Michael,"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection."
Dwight,No you can't do that.
Michael,"I can do that, it is my office."
Dwight,"No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine."
Michael,Hmmm. Ha. Alright. Great.
Dwight,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?"
Kevin,I'm not taking Rogaine.
Dwight,"Angela, what about you?"
Angela,I don't take any prescription drugs.
Dwight,You're not on anything?
Angela,
Dwight,Good.
Kelly,"So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. I mean not everything, Jim. I promise, I'm not that kind of..."
Pam,"Hey guys, what's going on?"
Kelly,We're having the best conversation.
Pam,"Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation."
Kelly,"So, I was looking so hot..."
Michael,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
Phyllis,We don't feel that way.
Angela,"No, not at all."
Oscar,You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Michael,"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, ""Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."""
Dwight,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael,"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind."
Michael,"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children."
Stanley,Where did you get these facts?
Michael,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?"
Stanley,They are not.
Michael,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Stanley,"No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants."
Michael,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?"
Toby,"Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael."
Michael,Yes it is.
Toby,"No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors."
Michael,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair."
Toby,You can't do that.
Michael,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly."
Toby,That's not random.
Michael,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam."
Pam,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Michael,Really?
Pam,"Uh, hmmm."
Michael,"Jim it's okay. You can t... This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it, okay. It's okay. Oh. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. Okay, well."
Pam,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Michael,"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not."
Dwight,"No, you will be tested."
Michael,"Yes, I will not be."
Dwight,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Michael,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you."
Dwight,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy."
Linda,We test a lot of urine.
Dwight,Mine was green.
Linda,"Oh, right. How are you?"
Dwight,I'm all better.
Michael,So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Dwight,What kind of filing?
Michael,Just forget it. Just the urine.
Dwight,That goes directly to the tester.
Michael,Just. I need your urine.
Dwight,Like in a cup?
Michael,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight."
Dwight,For what purpose?
Michael,It's none of your business.
Dwight,Then I refuse.
Michael,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring."
Dwight,Are you serious?
Michael,I need clean urine for the lady.
Dwight,But that's illegal.
Michael,"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes"
Dwight,Not my urine.
Michael,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
Dwight,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Michael,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup."
Angela,Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Dwight,I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Angela,You're not going to get my permission on this.
Dwight,I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Linda,"Yeah, we do testing all over the country."
Ryan,"Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?"
Linda,You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
Ryan,Yeah. Maybe.
Dwight,"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out."
Pam,"What? Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything."
Kevin,I'd like a magazine.
Linda,"We just need urine, sir."
Kevin,I'd still like one.
Michael,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much."
Dwight,That's great.
Michael,What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Dwight,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Michael,Why? Wha...
Dwight,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Pam,Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight.
Jim,Hi.
Pam,Hey.
Jim,How much time do you have left on your break?
Pam,Ten minutes.
Michael,"Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch."
Dwight,Really?
Michael,"Yes, sir."
Dwight,That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Michael,So you wanna? Thanks.
Hank,"Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security."
Michael,Okay.
Hank,Here's your badge.
Dwight,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. Can I have a gun?"
Hank,"No, I don't have a gun."
Dwight,"Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff."
Hank,I don't think so.
Michael,Good.
Dwight,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael,No. Oh. Uh...
Dwight,I need to go over some details with you.
Michael,"Alright. Well, Thank you."
Dwight,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?"
Hank,Two.
Dwight,"Oh, God."
Jim,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Kevin,"So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?"
Jim,"You know, it was one day."
Pam,No.
Michael,That's terrible.
Kevin,'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Jim,And I took it right back. It was like...
Jim,"Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out."
Pam,Okay.
Phyllis,Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Phyllis,"Oh, dear."
Pam,Yeah?
Michael,"Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go."
Phyllis,"Yeah, pretty stationery."
Michael,It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
Pam,"Oh, thanks!"
Michael,"One, two.. Didn't say three, did I?"
Angela,I didn't get mine yet.
Michael,"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems."
Pam,Uh...
Jim,"Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye."
Pam,"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy."
Female worker,"Okay, Jan will see you now."
Michael,"Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent."
Jim,"Oh, thanks."
Phyllis,"Uh, on or off?"
Michael,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches
I.D. Photographer,Off.
Phyllis,Okay...
Dwight,Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Phyllis,Excuse me.
Dwight,Clown paint.
Dwight,"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?"
Michael,That's a nice tie.
Ryan,Thank you.
Michael,That is... who makes that?
Ryan,"Um, I don't..."
Michael,Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Ryan,"Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes."
Oscar,"It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed..."
Michael,What's the dealio?
Toby,"Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today."
Michael,What's the problem?
Oscar,Angela!
Toby,It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Oscar,Since Christmas.
Michael,"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?"
Oscar,No.
Toby,"Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?"
Michael,Yes.
Toby,Here's how I usually handle this
Michael,Yeah?
Toby,These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Michael,Okay.
Toby,"It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it."
Michael,What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Toby,Okay.
Michael,Okay... what?
Toby,That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Michael,"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?"
Michael,"A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style."
Angela,Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Michael,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose."
Oscar,What's the next one?
Michael,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?"
Angela,Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Michael,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work."
Michael,"Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using ""I"" emotion language and no judging or ""you"" statements."
Angela,"I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor."
Michael,"Come on, seriously, that?"
Oscar,"I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the..."
Michael,"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win."
Pam,Win!
Michael,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win."
Oscar,No.
Angela,That's... no...
Michael,"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution."
Angela,"How about, I leave it up?"
Oscar,"How 'bout, she takes it down?"
Pam,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
Michael,"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win."
Pam,Win.
Oscar,Fine.
Angela,"But, it..."
Michael,It is done!
Pam,Win
Photographer,"No, you're all good."
Creed,Great.
Pam,"Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code."
Angela,Oh. Thanks.
Angela,"It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste."
Toby,You solved it?
Michael,Yes.
Toby,"Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out."
Michael,Are those all the other complains?
Toby,Mmm-Hm.
Michael,I would like to see those please.
Toby,I... I can't do that.
Michael,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file."
Toby,That...
Michael,Okay. There! No more conflict. I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. All right... is that it?
Toby,It's all Dwight's.
Toby,"Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York."
Michael,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Photographer,Are you sure?
Dwight,"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot."
Photographer,
Michael,"This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist."
Pam,Nice.
Michael,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Toby,"Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. Thisis January through March of this year."
Michael,"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?"
Angela,You already did me.
Michael,"That's what she said. The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does ""redacted"" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked ""redacted""... ?"
Toby,"Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off."
Michael,"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago."
Dwight,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?"
Pam,Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Michael,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next."
Pam,"Wait, what did it say?"
Michael,"Uh...""Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?"" Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?"
Pam,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Michael,Here is a Kelly complaint
Ryan,My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Kelly,I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Toby,To your HR representative.
Kelly,"To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn."
Toby,"Fine, I'll take your name off. So no one will know."
Michael,Makin' progress. Yes?
Jim,Dwight tried to kiss me.
Michael,What?!
Jim,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Dwight,That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Jim,"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it."
Dwight,"Okay, question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?"
Toby,Sure.
Michael,Stanley.
Pam,Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Michael,You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Anglea,I didn't do it!
Pam,I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Michael,"Someone complained that the men's room is ""whites only"". Stanley, you know that's not true."
Stanley,I didn't say that.
Creed,Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door?
Michael,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee."
Phyllis,"No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close."
Michael,"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him."
Phyllis,"Stanley and I are close, too."
Stanley,We sit close.
Michael,Oh... ok.
Toby,Just take it.
Pam,"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby."
Jim,"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends."
Pam,Don't take her side.
Jim,"Well, what does Roy think about everything?"
Pam,I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Jim,You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,Yeah...
Phyllis,"I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting."
Angela,"Yes, that's the problem."
Phyllis,I guess so...
Michael,"Okay, well... all settled, then."
Phyllis,I don't like you.
Michael,"OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?"
Creed,I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Michael,"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution"
Kevin,I accept your decision!
Jim,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together."
Dwight,That doesn't make any sense.
Jim,"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect."
Photographer,Smile.
Dwight,No.
Dwight,"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life."
Jim,This came out really well. There you go.
Dwight,This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Jim,Oh.
Dwight,"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'."
Jim,What did I write?
Dwight,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Toby,Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
Dwight,What box?!
Phyllis,But I didn't report your snoring-
Stanley,"Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays..."
Michael,Uh. Dwight.
Dwight,"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand."
Michael,Okay! Calm down.
Dwight,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Michael,"Hey, hey!"
Dwight,Him or me?
Michael,Stop.
Dwight,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Michael,Okay...
Dwight,"Either he goes, or I go."
Michael,Dwight...
Dwight,You choose!
Michael,Stop...
Dwight,One of us is out of here by the end of today!
Michael,Oh... kay...
Dwight,I am not bluffing!
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,Okay?
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years."
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,I deserve this. You know I do!
Michael,You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Dwight,You have till five.
Dwight,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!"
Michael,"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!"
Michael,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage."
Michael,"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - ""Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."" ""Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."""
Jim,Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Michael,"""This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."" ""Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."" Gah. ""This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."""
Jim,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out."
Michael,"""Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'."""
Jim,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though."
Michael,"""By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."""
Jim,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day."
Michael,"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful."
Jim,Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Dwight,It's a good market. Higher volume.
Jim,Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Dwight,I have a girlfriend...
Jim,"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure."
Michael,"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later."
Dwight,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?"
Michael,"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work."
Dwight,I want an answer by tomorrow.
Michael,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?"
Dwight,Fine.
Michael,Good. Okay.
Michael,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Photographer,I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Michael,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?"
Photographer,You mean digital?
Michael,It'll take like two seconds.
Photographer,20 bucks.
Michael,"Ugh... All right. Everybody, come on. Group photo for the newsletter."
Stanley,You gotta be kiddin' me.
Michael,"Come on, everybody."
Dwight,"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go."
Photographer,"One, two, three... smile. Try to smile."
Michael,"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts."
Photographer,"Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three."
Michael,"Good, let's check that out. Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more."
Photographer,That'll be another 20.
Michael,What?
Pam,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something."
Michael,You just press the button.
Angela,What?
Jim,"No, Pam."
Pam,I am. It's about the Save The Date.
Jim,"Pam, it wasn't her."
Pam,What?!
Jim,I'm the one who complained about you.
Jim,I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. I was just venting.
Michael,"Okay, good. Check that out."
Michael,"Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, ""Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening."" Makes you feel good."
Angela,"Good luck, Dwight."
Jim,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Dwight,Yeah! Yeah!
Dwight,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years."
Kevin,"Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go."
Pam,It's a nice tux.
Oscar,Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Dwight,"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom."
Dwight,Give me the dice!
Roy,"So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame."
Jim,"Yeah, right."
Pam,"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert."
Pam,"""Yeah, right,"" what?"
Dwight,"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance."
Jim,What was this?
Jim,I can always kind of win at roulette.
Pam,I have good cards.
Dwight,"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm."
Jim,Really?
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,"Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in."
Dwight,How would you do that?
Jim,Wow. I think you're bluffing.
Jim,Mind control.
Kevin,"Yeah, I think she's full of it."
Dwight,You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Pam,Straight.
Jim,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind."
Jim,Oh. Three nines.
Dwight,I don't believe you. Continue.
Kevin,"Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen."
Jim,"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things."
Jim,Thank you very much. It was fun.
Dwight,"That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead."
Jan,"Cosmopolitan, please."
Jim,"Okay, I'll try."
Carol,"Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive."
Dwight,"Oh, my God."
Jan,"Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been..."
Michael,I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Carol,"Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess."
Jan,"Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee."
Jan,Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Michael,Top 80 percent!
Carol,"Well, I'm having a nice time."
Jan,Michael?
Jan,"Oh, me too. Me too."
Michael,Yeah?
Ryan,"One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can."
Jan,You know that I'm very serious here.
Jim,"So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?"
Michael,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!"
Michael,All right!
Jan,What?
Dealer,"The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!"
Michael,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here."
Dwight,"Come on, shooter!"
Jan,I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael,"Four! Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. All right, here we go!"
Michael,"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez."
Carol,All right.
Jan,I think you can handle it.
Michael,Yeah!
Michael,"Oh, come on. Come on."
Dealer,Five.
Jan,"I think so, Michael..."
Michael,So close. So close.
Michael,"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break."
Dwight,Come on. So where you staying? Radisson?
Jan,"Goodbye, Michael."
Jan,What?
Michael,"Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day."
Dwight,Super 8?
Michael,"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America."
Jan,"No, I..."
Oscar,Again? We do that every year.
Dwight,Motel 6? Best Western?
Michael,"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts."
Jan,I didn't... I don't know...
Oscar,It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Dwight,Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
Michael,"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration."
Kevin,"I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker."
Dwight,Yes!
Kevin,All-in.
Michael,"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief."
Phyllis,"Okay, let's do it."
Jim,That doesn't exist anymore.
Bob Vance,"Good Luck, honey."
Michael,"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people."
Phyllis,"Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play."
Pam,"No, they stopped making that show."
Kevin,Three queens.
Michael,"Well, then, they need our money more than ever."
Dwight,"Nice, very nice."
Angela,"You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization."
Phyllis,I have an ace.
Creed,There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Oscar,"No, that's a flush."
Kevin,Something with animals. Or people.
Dwight,"Oh, man!"
Kelly,"Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it."
Phyllis,"Oh, I have a flush!"
Angela,"We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?"
Bob,Yes!
Michael,"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna..."
Phyllis,"Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?"
Toby,"Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?"
Kevin,I suck.
Michael,"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS."
Roy,"She took you down, huh?"
Jim,I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Kevin,I do not want to talk about it.
Michael,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS."
Roy,"Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock."
Phyllis,Afghani.
Kevin,Yeah?
Michael,What?
Roy,"Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?"
Phyllis,Afghani.
Kevin,Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
Michael,That's a dog.
Roy,Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Pam,"No, that's Afghan."
Kevin,"Dude, you will not be sorry."
Michael,That's a shawl.
Roy,Sweet. All right.
Dwight,"Wait, canine AIDS?"
Kevin,All right.
Michael,No. Humans with AIDS.
Jan,Smoke?
Creed,Who has AIDS?
Jim,"No, thanks. You having fun?"
Jim,"Guys, the Afghanistananies."
Jan,Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Michael,"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried."
Jim,"Yeah, we all really..."
Michael,"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. ""I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."" And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams."
Jan,"Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed"
Jim,What are you doing?
Jim,"Well, I think you look great."
Pam,"Oh, nothing."
Jan,Why did I hook up with Michael?
Jim,"""Till Death Do Us Rock."""
Jim,"Yeah, why did you?"
Pam,They're wedding bands.
Jan,"It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?"
Jim,Oh.
Jim,"Oh, yeah."
Pam,"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now."
Jan,Good. Have you told anyone?
Jim,"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams."
Jim,No.
Pam,There's a KISS cover band in here.
Jan,"Well, you should."
Jim,Let's do it.
Bob,"Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!"
Pam,I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
Creed,Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
Jim,"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here."
Roy,"Sorry, babe. I am just beat."
Michael,I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
Pam,It's okay. I'll see you at home.
Darryl,"Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse."
Roy,"Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?"
Michael,It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Pam,Okay.
Darryl,Except my warehouse.
Roy,"If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?"
Michael,"Well, actually, it's my warehouse."
Jim,"Okay, will do."
Dwight,"Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease."
Roy,See you.
Michael,Why are you here?
Pam,Bye! Hey.
Dwight,"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection."
Jim,"Hey, how's it going?"
Michael,"Not. I said, not that."
Pam,"Good, especially after I took all your money in poker."
Darryl,We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Jim,"Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?"
Michael,That's ironic.
Pam,About when you want to give me more of your money?
Darryl,What?
Jim,"No, I..."
Michael,That you are afraid.
Pam,Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Darryl,Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
Jim,I was just... I'm in love with you.
Michael,Dinkin' flicka.
Pam,What?
Darryl,Dinkin' flicka.
Jim,"I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just..."
Darryl,"I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, ""Fleece it out."" ""Going mach five."" ""Dinkin' flicka."" You know, things us Negroes say."
Pam,What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Michael,Give me some.
Jim,I just needed you to know. Once.
Darryl,"Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too."
Pam,"Well, I um... I... I can't."
Jim,Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Pam,You have no idea...
Jim,Yes.
Jim,Don't do that.
Pam,"Have three stages, yeah."
Pam,...what your friendship means to me.
Jim,"Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity."
Jim,Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be more than that.
Pam,Oh.
Pam,I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
Jim,Let's take a look. Nice.
Jim,Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Pam,"Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums."
Jan,Hey. I'm leaving.
Jim,What?
Michael,"Hey, okay."
Pam,On the drums! On the drums!
Jan,"So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud."
Jim,"Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer."
Michael,Thank you.
Kevin,We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Jan,"And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks."
Jim,Wow. Oh!
Michael,Okay. Thanks for coming.
Pam,"Oh, my..."
Jan,Nice to meet you.
Jim,"Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna..."
Carol,"You, too."
Pam,No! No!
Jan,And you guys have a good time together.
Jim,"No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding."
Michael,Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Pam,"No, come back! No, no, no!"
Jan,Yeah.
Jim,Kev!
Carol,Goodbye.
Pam,Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
Michael,Good night. She's a good boss.
Michael,Yes
Carol,She seems really nice.
Pam,"Michael, Carol Stills for you."
Michael,"Oh, she's great."
Michael,Who?
Michael,"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good."
Pam,Carol Stills.
Pam,"About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am. I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim..."
Michael,Do I know a Carol Stills?
Pam,Your realtor.
Michael,"Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?"
Pam,It's still me.
Pam,Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Pam,"Carol, you're on with Michael."
Carol,"Hello, Michael?"
Michael,"Hi, Carol. How you doing?"
Carol,I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Michael,"Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place."
Carol,"Oh, great."
Michael,"Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped."
Carol,"Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?"
Michael,"Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night."
Carol,"Oh, great."
Michael,"Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink."
Carol,To the casino thing?
Michael,Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
Carol,What?
Michael,"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?"
Pam,"Michael, Jan's on line two."
Michael,"Okay, put her through. Jan Levinson, I presume?"
Pam,"It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael."
Jan,Michael?
Michael,"Hey, Jan. How you doing?"
Jan,"You know, I... I thought about it and you are right."
Michael,I am?
Jan,"I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night."
Michael,"Oh, okay."
Jan,"Incidentally, what is the charity?"
Michael,AIDS.
Jan,"Okay, then. I will see you tonight."
Michael,"Okay, sounds great."
Jan,Bye-bye.
Michael,"Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just..."
Carol,No problemo.
Michael,Right.
Carol,To answer your question...
Michael,Yeah?
Carol,Yes.
Michael,What?
Carol,I'd love to go.
Michael,Okay.
Carol,"I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem."
Michael,Problem. Good.
Carol,"And I'll bring the papers, too."
Michael,"Good, All right. Sounds great."
Carol,I'll see you tonight.
Michael,Bye.
Carol,Bye.
Michael,Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Pam,"Oh, my God!"
Roy,Yeah! That's great.
Michael,"Hey, hey."
Carol,Hi.
Michael,"Hey, Carol."
Carol,Hi.
Michael,You look great.
Carol,Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Michael,"Oh, well... Kiss. That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight"
Dwight,Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Dwight,"I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, ""We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."""
Michael,Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Carol,Drink would be good.
Michael,Okay.
Creed,"Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things."
Billy's Girlfriend,I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Billy,"No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart."
Billy's Girlfriend,Okay.
Michael,"Billy, your nurse is hot."
Billy,That's my girlfriend.
Michael,Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Billy,She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
Michael,Chili's is great.
Michael,"Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss."
Stanley,Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Michael,"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows."
Dealer,"Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir."
Michael,All-in.
Michael,"Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?"
Toby,I'll call.
Michael,What are... That's insane.
Toby,I have good cards.
Michael,"Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back."
Dealer,"No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in."
Michael,"Okay, all right, whatever."
Dealer,Flip them.
Michael,You really screwed that up.
Meredith,Wow.
Toby,"I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling."
Dwight,"I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs."
Jim,I will raise. Thanks.
Jim,"It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds."
Carol,"Wow, bad luck."
Michael,"Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
Jan,Michael?
Michael,Jan.
Jan,Hi.
Michael,"Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship."
Jan,"What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?"
Carol,What does that mean?
Michael,"After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong."
Jan,"No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss."
Carol,"Hi, hi."
Jan,Does anyone want a drink?
Carol,"No, I'm good."
Jan,Okay.
Michael,Um...
Dwight,"Hey, hey."
Michael,Hey. What...
Dwight,Jan's here.
Dwight,Give me the dice.
Kevin,"Come on, Dwight."
Dwight,Let's go.
Billy,"It's all on you, baby. Let's go."
Angela,"Good evening, Dwight. What is this?"
Dwight,"Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins."
Kevin,Yes.
Angela,Then roll an eight.
Dwight,"Thank you, Angela."
Ryan,"Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will not say ""Ryan Howard is a temp."" It will say ""Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. ...that'll show 'em."
Jim,You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
Pam,Me too. ...I think we're just drunk.
Jim,No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk?
Pam,No... Jim---
Jim,Are you really gonna marry him? ...Ok.
Dwight,"Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! False. I do not miss him."
Michael,"No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody ""faggie"". Why would anybody find that offensive?"
Toby,"OK I think Oscar would just like if you used ""lame"" or something like that."
Michael,That's what faggie means!
Toby,No not really...
Toby,"Apparently you called Oscar ""faggie"" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie."
Michael,"It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!"
Toby,"All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay."
Michael,Exactly!
Toby,I mean for real.
Michael,"Yeah, I know."
Toby,"No, I mean he's attracted to other men."
Michael,"OK, a little too far, crossed the line."
Toby,"OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion."
Michael,"I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people ""retards"". It's bad taste. You call your friends ""retards"" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend."
Michael,"Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea."
Oscar,"No, it's fine."
Michael,"No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people ""faggie"" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
Oscar,"That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that."
Angela,It explains so much.
Oscar,"No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... Uh... yeah I'm gay."
Jim,"I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable."
Jim,Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right?
Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right?"
Jim,"Uh-huh, yeah. I am."
Andy,She's pretty hot huh? She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.
Jim,OooOK.
Andy,OooOK.
Jim,"I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name."
Andy,"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, ""Here Comes Treble."""
Josh,"So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them."
Jim,"Oh, I can do that."
Karen,Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this. What is that?
Michael,Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
Dwight,Of course.
Michael,What about Oscar?
Dwight,Absolutely not.
Michael,"Well, he is."
Dwight,"Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so..."
Michael,There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
Dwight,"You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive."
Michael,"Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay."
Michael,"Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman."
Dwight,I really don't think so.
Michael,"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?"
Dwight,
Michael,Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
Dwight,Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Michael,That's ridiculous.
Dwight,Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Michael,Let's call him and get the website.
Dwight,Definitely.
Jim,"What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem. It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer."
Michael,"Well, they're sold out."
Dwight,Damn. I'll try Brookstone.
Jim,I miss that.
Roy,Chicken or fish?
Pam,Chicken.
Roy,So you havin' a good day?
Pam,"Excellent, thanks."
Roy,"Good, glad. OK."
Pam,"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks."
Roy,"After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back."
Stanley,"I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters."
Kelly,That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you.
Oscar,"Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan."
Angela,"Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented."
Andy,"OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!"
Jan,"You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation."
Michael,"I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so..."
Jan,That's not what it's called.
Toby,"OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?"
Michael,What? What does that even...
Jan,"Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it."
Michael,"Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival."
Toby,"All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault."
Michael,I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?
Jan,NO!
Michael,I don't kn--
Jan,"No, it's not possible."
Michael,Anything's possible.
Jan,"You know, imagine... you were gay."
Michael,"Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!"
Jan,"Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?"
Michael,"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
Oscar,Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Michael,"Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?"
Pam,"Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer."
Dwight,"Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons."
Michael,"Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful."
Dwight,Ah damn pop-ups.
Oscar,What are you doing?!
Angela,Watching some of your friends.
Michael,"All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!"
Michael,"Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men."
Michael,"We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you."
Oscar,"Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?"
Creed,
Michael,Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
Angela,Judges and juries!
Michael,"Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?"
Kevin,
Dwight,"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them."
Oscar,No one else in this office is gay.
Dwight,What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Phyllis,I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
Michael,"That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! See? Everybody has a chance!"
Michael,"But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!"
Phyllis,"No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school."
Michael,Right! And I take that as a compliment.
Phyllis,Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
Michael,"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---"
Oscar,You sound pretty defensive Michael.
Michael,"No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!"
Oscar,I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here.
Michael,No no no. The only signal that I am sending is
Michael,"Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag."
Oscar,"I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life."
Michael,"You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---"
Oscar,I would rather not.
Michael,"...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!"
Oscar,"No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!"
Michael,"All right, um... sorry."
Oscar,"Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on."
Michael,I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.
Dwight,Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.
Michael,"You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this. I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here."
Michael,"Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!"
Michael,"We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?"
Michael,"I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said."
Michael,"Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?"
Oscar,"I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay."
Dwight,"""Hope this helps. -Jim"" Nice!"
Oscar,What are you doing?!
Dwight,Shhh. Don't be scared. It works. ...oh no.
Michael,Pam?
Pam,You dream in cartoons? How fun!
Pam,Yeah?
Michael,"Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend."
Michael,Did you see Oprah yesterday?
Guy,I thought there was a party in here.
Pam,"No, I didn't."
Michael,This is the party.
Michael,"I, uh... I am going to be a father."
Guy,This is room 308?
Pam,What was Oprah about?
Michael,"Party central! So, what can I do you for? All right."
Michael,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost."
Alan,"See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels."
Pam,That's a really big decision.
Pam,Huh.
Michael,I know.
Alan,Freedom fries for the table.
Pam,Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
Pam,Freedom fries. Yeah.
Michael,Well...
Alan,"Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, ""Don't be edgy."" But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it."
Pam,Or not adopt.
Pam,"Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan."
Michael,"Just do it, okay?"
Alan,"Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain."
Pam,"Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars."
Pam,More freedom fries.
Michael,"Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?"
Alan,Yeah.
Pam,"You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months."
Pam,That's great.
Michael,Eight months?
Alan,Okay.
Pam,Yeah.
Pam,"I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know."
Michael,I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
Jim,Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
Pam,You probably won't.
Michael,People have been filtering in and out.
Michael,"You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby..."
Jim,Can I get a drink?
Pam,"No, Michael."
Michael,What?
Michael,Twenty years.
Jim,Can I get a drink?
Pam,"No, Michael."
Michael,Sure. You like Cosmos?
Michael,Thirty.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,Sure.
Michael,"Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?"
Michael,It's a deal.
Jim,Michael...
Ryan,All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Michael,"I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just..."
Michael,Yesh.
Jim,"Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss."
Ryan,"Uh, fun jeans."
Michael,I'm not better than Josh.
Michael,Right there. Ah.
Jim,"Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam."
Angela,Sign.
Michael,Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
Michael,Per diem.
Jim,"No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice."
Michael,"Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled s*x romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo."
Michael,"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her."
Dwight,"Don't be mad, it is a business trip."
Jim,"Nope, that's okay."
Angela,But I don't understand. It's for managers.
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,"Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager."
Jim,That's all right.
Angela,I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. Are you still there?
Michael,"I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling."
Dwight,"Yes, Monkey."
Jim,"Yeah. Okay, maybe."
Angela,"Don't ""Monkey"" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M."
Evan,Are we early?
Angela,"In the Martin family, we like to say, ""Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly."" That's code for ""check out the slut."" What is... why are there flies in here?"
Michael,"Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out."
Kelly,"Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?"
Jim,Hey.
Pam,This.
Michael,"Evan, this is Jim."
Kelly,You look so pretty.
Jim,How are you?
Pam,Thank you.
Evan,"Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim."
Pam,"Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that."
Michael,"Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?"
Kelly,"Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power."
Evan,Do you guys work together?
Michael,"Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?"
Jim,"No, we used to. Now we're friends."
Kelly,My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Michael,Best friends.
Michael,"Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker."
Michael,"Some people need dozens of friends to say, ""Hey, look at me, I'm popular."" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly."
Dwight,And your veil.
Michael,"Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? Ha, ha, ha."
Michael,"Yeah, do it!"
Dwight,"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
Pam,I'll probably just wear this.
Michael,Whoa. What are those stains?
Michael,"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice"
Dwight,"Blood, urine, or semen."
Pam,Um...
Michael,"Oh, God, I hope it's urine."
Michael,"Um. Okay, um."
Dwight,Um.
Michael,You got that?
Dwight,I got it.
Michael,Write it down.
Dwight,I got it.
Dwight,Um.
Michael,Um.
Dwight and Michael,"Um, um, um..."
Creed,There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
Angela,"That was for per diem, for Philadelphia."
Meredith,That town smells like cheese steaks.
Angela,That town is full of history!
Creed,Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. Creed.
Dwight,Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Josh,"Hey, Michael."
Michael,"Hey, Josh, how ya doing?"
Josh,Pretty good.
Michael,"Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns."
Michael,"I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut."
Jim,"It's really good to see you, man."
Michael,"Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!"
Dwight,"Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?"
Jim,"Yeah, sold about forty thousand."
Michael,Hey!
Dwight,Shut up. That's impossible.
Jim,"No, it's not. I did. Yep."
Dwight,"Well, I did it too."
Jim,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key."
Kevin,So did you hear?
Toby,What?
Kevin,Pam's back on the market again.
Toby,Really? She's dating?
Kevin,"If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that."
Dwight,So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Jim,"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much."
Dwight,You're so immature!
Josh,"Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman."
Michael,Ah.
Josh,"And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford."
Jan,"Oh, hey!"
Dwight,"Hey, Jan."
Jan,We all checked in?
Josh,Yes.
Jan,"Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour."
Josh,Okay.
Jan,Okay!
Michael,"Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules."
Jan,What are you talking about?
Michael,"The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention."
Jan,"Step away from me, Michael."
Michael,Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
Kelly,"Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?"
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Kelly,"And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time."
Dwight,This party is going to be awesome.
Michael,I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
Dwight,Check it out.
Michael,That is crooked on that side.
Dwight,Wow.
Michael,Hey hey!
Jim,That is a lot of liquor.
Michael,Yeah.
Jim,And a dart board.
Michael,"Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop."
Josh,We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.
Michael,"Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?"
Josh,"A shot of MIDORI, perhaps."
Jim,"Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there."
Michael,Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Josh,"Um, we should..."
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up."
Dwight,"I'll do a shot, Michael."
Michael,"Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet."
Michael,SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
Michael,"Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin."
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin."
Jerome Bettis,All right.
Dwight,I'm a huge fan.
Jerome Bettis,"Thanks. I appreciate it, guys."
Michael,"You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come."
Jerome Bettis,"All right, maybe. If I can."
Michael,"Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?"
Jerome Bettis,"No, you cannot."
Michael,So maybe. See ya.
Dwight,Why do they call him The Bus?
Michael,Because he's afraid to fly.
Dwight,Smile!
Michael,"Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!"
Josh,"All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front."
Michael,"Yep. Yeah, she's up front."
Dwight,You don't have email on your phone.
Michael,"I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?"
Dwight,No one just called you.
Josh,All right.
Jim,"All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care."
Ted,I'll see you soon.
Josh,"Yeah, stop by later."
Michael,See you in a bit. Bye-bye. May I have a moment of your time please?
Michael,I need you to do something for me.
Dwight,Yes. Anything.
Michael,I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
Dwight,"I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat."
Toby,"Hey, Pam."
Pam,Hey! What's up?
Toby,"It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted..."
Pam,"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. Sorry. What's up?"
Toby,"Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird."
Pam,"Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here."
Toby,Okay.
Dwight,"So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera."
Michael,And?
Dwight,He wasn't volunteering today.
Michael,Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
Jim,Oh yeah?
Michael,Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
Jim,"Oh, tell him I say hi."
Michael,I will call him later with that message.
Jim,"Hey, how is... Toby?"
Michael,Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Jim,"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to..."
Michael,"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically."
Jim,"Michael, it's really not a competition."
Josh,Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
Jan,Great!
Michael,"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip."
Dwight,Whoa. Michael.
Waiter,"Wow, oh my God, thank you."
Michael,You're welcome.
Dwight,Was that your per diem?
Michael,"No, that was a different hundred dollar bill."
Jan,"What have you generated, Michael?"
Michael,I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
Jan,What party?
Michael,"The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited."
Jan,"Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7."
Phyllis,"You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it."
Stanley,"If you do that, you're going to have to put out."
Phyllis,"Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out."
Angela,Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
Michael,Any messages for 308? All right.
Michael,"Hey hey, fellers."
Jim,Michael.
Dwight,"Hey, Michael."
Michael,What's up?
Josh,"Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now."
Michael,"Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton."
Josh,I don't think so.
Michael,"Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend."
Josh,Fine! All right.
Michael,Okay! Excellent. Oh...
Dwight,Keep the wing flaps.
Michael,"Shut it. Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. Say hi to Pam!"
"Jim, Josh, and Dwight","Hi, Pam."
Michael,"Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. Pam says hi. Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye."
Michael,You first.
Dwight,"Come on. Nice try, Josh!"
Michael,"Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing."
Josh,"Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael."
Michael,"Well, let's..."
Josh,"Yeah, we should go."
Michael,Come on!
Josh,We gotta go.
Michael,Come on!
Josh,Uh... we'll do it later.
Evan,"Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line?"
Michael,Fine.
Michael,"Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work."
Evan,That is so true. Ready?
Michael,"Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for."
Evan,Great.
Michael,"Sorry, my meeting ran late."
Jan,Really?
Michael,"Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill."
Josh,They're exclusive with Staples.
Michael,Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
Dwight,Yes! Ha!
Jan,"Well, Michael, I underestimated you."
Michael,"Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me."
Jim,Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
Angela,D?
Jim,"Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!"
Kelly,"So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day."
Alan,"Oh, great."
Ryan,I don't want ketchup.
Kelly,You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
Pam,So how do you come up with your cartoons?
Alan,"Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them."
Michael,Ahhhhhhhhh. I'm hungry.
Michael,"Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?"
Michael,Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
Dwight,Don't fire me. Please.
Michael,"Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
Michael,Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
Dwight,Take a seat down there. Second from the end.
Dwight,I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
Michael,"Alright, everybody here? Yes."
Michael,Not. Good. Enough!
Pam,Popcorn anyone?
Dwight,I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!
Michael,Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!
Michael,I have a laundry machine!
Pam,Anyone else? Nooo.
Dwight,"I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear."
Pam,"Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times."
Michael,I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
Michael,Entourage!
Dwight,"You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?"
Michael,"Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?"
Michael,"You can get up. Get up. And you can hug it out, bitch."
Kevin,Yes!
Michael,"Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate."
Dwight,Why him?
Jim,
Michael,Don't whine. Get the window.
Karen,
Michael,Previously on Varsity Blues...
Michael,"Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, and I'm making him do my laundry for a year."
Kevin,"Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year..."
Jan,Hello?
Dwight,Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.
Angela,I don't approve. I don't.
Jan,Hello?
Michael,Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
Jan,How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that?
Michael,People work faster after...
Jan,Magically?
Michael,No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
Jan,No.
Angela,Kitchen.
Angela,"Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs."
Dwight,That's not going to happen.
Angela,You know she has it out for him now.
Dwight,That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!
Dwight,"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms."
Angela,"Dwight, you should be running this office."
Dwight,Michael would never let me...
Angela,"It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her."
Dwight,I could never do that!
Angela,Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
Angela,"I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair."
Jim,"At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus."
Pam,"Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here."
Pam,"Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes."
Pam,Ok.
Kelly,I love it!
Pam,Really? I don't know.
Kelly,"You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on."
Pam,"Not at work, I'll try it on---"
Kelly,Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!
Pam,...noooo
Kelly,Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!
Andy,Why did you do that?!
Jim,"I'm just killing Germans, any way I can."
Andy,We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish.
Jim,"Wait, are we playing teams?"
Karen,Yeah.
Dwight,WAH! GAH!
Jan,Hello?
Dwight,Is this Jan?
Jan,Who is this?
Dwight,This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
Jan,"You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other."
Dwight,It's about Michael.
Jan,What about him?
Dwight,I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.
Jan,It's not about a surprise party is it?
Dwight,"No, but we should discuss that another time."
Jan,"Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back."
Dwight,"Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you."
Jan,How do you know I like that store?
Dwight,Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
Jan,How do you know that?
Dwight,Part of my job.
Jan,No it's not. It's officially not.
Dwight,...noted.
Dwight,I'm going... to the dentist.
Michael,Ok.
Dwight,I have to have an emergency crown put in.
Michael,Ouchy.
Dwight,Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.
Michael,"Three hours, wow. Have fun."
Dwight,Did you get anything good?
Jan,Yeah.
Dwight,New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?
Dwight,I can save the branch.
Jan,Really?
Dwight,If you let me run it.
Jan,Ok.
Dwight,"""Ok"" I can run it?"
Jan,What would you do differently?
Dwight,Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.
Jan,"Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers."
Dwight,"The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So, here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision."
Dwight,"Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings."
Jan,Where is it?
Jan,Michael.
Michael,Hi.
Jan,I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
Michael,Oh. That's nice.
Jan,"No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you."
Michael,...what?
Jan,Mm-hmm.
Michael,...you were at the dentist?
Jan,You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.
Michael,Ok.
Michael,What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.
Phyllis,Woooooow.
Kelly,It's so sexy. You look so hot.
Phyllis,It's really something.
Pam,It's too much.
Kelly,What?
Pam,I'm gonna return it.
Kelly,"No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel."
Roy,Hey.
Pam,Hi.
Roy,You look nice.
Pam,Thanks.
Kelly,Isn't that like your third soda today?
Jim,"Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company. Ok, see you next week. Bye. Again?"
Karen,Scared?
Karen,Call of Duty!
Josh,"Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?"
Andy,Now?
Josh,Yes now.
Andy,Put the game on hold everyone.
Josh,"This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there."
Andy,It's the new guy.
Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about..."
Andy,See what I mean?
Josh,"We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?"
Jim,"Um, sniper rifle?"
Josh,SNIPE--
Andy,WHAT?
Josh,JIM!
Andy,Are you playing for the other team?!
Josh,"You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?"
Andy,Saboteur!
Josh,"Andy, it's not---"
Andy,Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you.
Michael,Hey Dwight.
Dwight,Hey.
Michael,Do you want an M&M?
Dwight,No thanks I'm stuffed.
Michael,"No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good."
Dwight,...ok.
Michael,"They're good, huh?"
Dwight,...so good.
Michael,Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
Dwight,"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so..."
Michael,Sounds like a good dentist.
Dwight,"Oh, yeah."
Michael,What's his name?
Dwight,Crentist.
Michael,Your dentist's name is Crentist.
Dwight,Yep.
Michael,Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
Dwight,Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
Michael,Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.
Dwight,Ahh. Aaaah.
Michael,You should... floss.
Dwight,I know...
Michael,Well then... I am glad you're ok.
Michael,"Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology."
Michael,"Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?"
Michael,"Wow, this is tough."
Dwight,What?
Michael,Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!
Dwight,What is it?
Michael,"Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me."
Dwight,No.
Michael,Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
Dwight,Gahh!
Michael,"And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton."
Dwight,I can't believe this news. That--- wow.
Michael,I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
Dwight,You said that?
Michael,"Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it."
Dwight,"Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will."
Michael,"Perfect, well, we're settled."
Dwight,All right.
Michael,"All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager."
Dwight,"Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it."
Michael,Ohh..
Dwight,Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Michael,Can't you? That's so nice.
Michael,Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
Dwight,"Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Ok let's do it."
Michael,"Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight."
Phyllis,You're kidding...
Michael,"You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that."
Angela,Congratulations Dwight.
Dwight,Thank you Angela.
Stanley,But... why Dwight?
Michael,"Because, Dwight... never lies."
Stanley,How does that qualify him to run a branch?
Michael,Because that's all it takes.
Michael,"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?"
Dwight,"Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!"
Phyllis,"Michael, what will you do?"
Michael,"Oh, I'll be fine."
Kevin,Do you have any savings?
Michael,"No, no, I don't, but---"
Kevin,"Michael, you might lose your condo."
Michael,I... won't. I won't.
Pam,"I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager."
Phyllis,Maybe I'll quit.
Angela,It's really happening!
Dwight,Yes.
Angela,We can make a difference here.
Dwight,"I, will, make a difference here."
Angela,You alone? Because I thought together we could---
Dwight,"Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women."
Karen,Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
Jim,I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
Karen,"I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around."
Jim,I'm trying---
Karen,Just tap S then D.
Jim,Oh.
Karen,Any... last words? No?
Jim,What?
Jim,Wow. Psychopath.
Pam,What?
Creed,I'm just looking.
Pam,Please go back to your desk.
Creed,In a minute.
Pam,"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas."
Michael,"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring."
Dwight,No thank you.
Michael,"It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it."
Dwight,No thanks.
Michael,What?
Dwight,Not my style.
Michael,But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
Dwight,"Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate."
Michael,Take it back.
Dwight,No.
Michael,That's my car.
Dwight,What did you---
Michael,THAT'S MY CAR.
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,"I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know."
Dwight,You know what?
Michael,Jan called me about your little meeting!
Dwight,No!
Michael,"I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight."
Dwight,I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Michael,"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?"
Ryan,"Uh, no thanks, I'm good."
Michael,"Oh, it's okay, I'm going down."
Ryan,"Um... Yeah, absolutely."
Michael,"All right, I'll be right back."
Dwight,Whoo!
Michael,There you go.
Dwight,Awesome!
Ryan,Thank you.
Michael,You're welcome.
Dwight,"Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?"
Michael,Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.
Dwight,Okay. Whoo!
Michael,"There you go, fresh from the warehouse."
Pam,"Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?"
Michael,"There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam."
Pam,But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Ryan and others,"Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great."
Michael,All right. Okay.
Michael,I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.
Pam,With cream and sugar?
Michael,All right.
Jan,"So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck."
Michael,"Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?"
Jan,"Michael, Ed died over the weekend."
Michael,"Oh, wow."
Michael,"Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died."
Kelly,"Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad."
Michael,"Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss."
Phyllis,That's a shame. Ed was a good guy.
Michael,"That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up."
Michael,So did you hear the news?
Pam,The news that you just announced? That Ed died?
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,Is there anything I can do?
Michael,"Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,
Pam,Oh. Okay.
Michael,Yeah. Mmmmmm.
Pam,Okay.
Josh,"What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list?"
Karen,"Um, shoot. Uh, I will. Sorry."
Josh,"Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure?"
Jim,"Oh yeah, definitely."
Andy,"Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said?"
Josh,"Thank you, everyone."
Karen,Dammit.
Jim,What's up?
Karen,"Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips."
Jim,Oh.
Karen,But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Jim,"Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please."
Creed,"It's a real shame about Ed, huh?"
Michael,Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.
Creed,About what?
Michael,"The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that."
Creed,Ed was decapitated.
Michael,What?
Dwight,Really?
Creed,"He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off."
Michael,Oh my God.
Dwight,That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.
Creed,You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
Dwight,You're thinking of a chicken.
Creed,What did I say?
Michael,"That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him."
Michael,"So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this..."
Dwight,Ed was decapitated.
Michael,What are you doing?
Dwight,You said you didn't know how to say it.
Michael,I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
Dwight,Hey.
Angela,Hi.
Dwight,"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice."
Angela,I do not wanna talk about this.
Dwight,"When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in."
Michael,"I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here."
Jan,"I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?"
Michael,"You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off."
Jan,"Well, what would you suggest?"
Michael,A statue.
Jan,Of Ed?
Michael,Yeah.
Jan,I'm not sure that's realistic.
Michael,"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him."
Jan,"No, that's not---"
Michael,"We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move..."
Dwight,"That is not a statue, that is a robot."
Michael,I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Dwight,And how big do you want this robot?
Michael,Life-size.
Dwight,"Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us."
Jan,What the hell are you two talking about?
Michael,"Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan."
Jan,"You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today..."
Michael,Mm hm.
Jan,...and I have to get back to work.
Michael,Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
Jan,So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Michael,But Ed truck can't because he is---
Jan,Goodbye.
Michael,DEAD.
Dwight,Look I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Michael,That's perfect.
Jim,"Okay, that is a ""no"" on the on the West Side Market."
Karen,"Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now?"
Jim,Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.
Karen,I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want.
Jim,Really?
Karen,"Yeah, all day."
Andy,Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.
Jim,"Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen."
Andy,Did you check the vending machine?
Karen,"Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that?"
Jim,I have no idea. We went right for the copier.
Karen,Mm.
Jim,And then we checked the fax machine.
Karen,"Yeah, nothing there."
Andy,Did you check your... butt?
Michael,"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam."
Phyllis,Okay that's enough.
Michael,What?
Stanley,We do not wanna hear about this.
Michael,"Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!"
Stanley,You have just spit on my face.
Michael,"Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!"
Michael,"There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job."
Michael,"I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone."
Roy,"Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car."
Michael,"Okay, fine. Hurry back."
Roy,"There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the ""grief counseling"" session."
Pam,Oh. I would like a break.
Roy,How are you likin' the new car?
Pam,Great.
Roy,Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?
Pam,"I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders."
Roy,"Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah."
Jim,"Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back. Shut up."
Karen,Six?
Michael,"Okay, we can start. Um..."
Pam,You waited for me?
Michael,"Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?"
Dwight,"I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby."
Michael,"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else."
Stanley,Nope.
Michael,"Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go."
Stanley,I will NOT.
Michael,Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Pam,"Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die."
Michael,"Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay."
Ryan,"Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened."
Michael,Do you want to talk about it anymore?
Ryan,"Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story."
Kevin,"Me, me, me, me, me me. Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so..."
Michael,Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game?
Phyllis,"Well, there is a ball."
Michael,"All right, we're starting over."
Stanley,"No, I'm done."
Michael,You are not leaving. No! We are not done.
Angela,We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Michael,"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk."
Toby,"Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going."
Michael,How do you know?
Toby,What?
Michael,That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?
Toby,It was obvious...
Michael,"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!"
Dwight,Michael! Michael. Michael ...
Michael,"Oh, God!"
Dwight,Oh...
Michael,"Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ..."
Dwight,Poor little fella.
Michael,Oh shhhh--oot!
Dwight,He is a goner.
Michael,"No, he's not."
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,"No, he's not."
Dwight,"Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!"
Michael,"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!"
Angela,A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Michael,We don't know if it's dead.
Kelly,"Ugh, no that thing is dead."
Dwight,You want me to flush him?
Michael,Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
Meredith,I have a lot of work to do.
Michael,"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it."
Angela,But...
Michael,"No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him."
Karen,I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
Jim,Nice!
Karen,Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir.
Jim,Sounded good.
Karen,Thanks.
Kelly,
Michael,"It's okay. It's okay. Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show."
Kelly,"I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight?"
Dwight,Argh... gah!
Michael,What are... What are you doing?
Dwight,"What? No, this is about the right size."
Michael,"No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?"
Dwight,"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute."
Dwight,I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.
Pam,Is it for the bird?
Dwight,Yeah.
Pam,I have it covered.
Dwight,"Oh, thank you."
Pam,If you wanna do something for the funeral...
Dwight,"Yes, please."
Pam,Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
Dwight,Excellent.
Pam,Do you have it with you?
Dwight,Always.
Pam,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.
Karen,Where'd you find them?
Jim,Where'd I find what?
Jim,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door."
Michael,Glad you could all make it.
Kelly,You told us we had to.
Michael,"Dwight, do you have the box?"
Pam,"Actually, I have it."
Michael,You made this? Wow. That's... that's very nice.
Ryan,"When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking ""I'm a little too old for this."" And I was five."
Pam,I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
Michael,Yes.
Pam,"What do we know about this bird? You might think, ""Not much. It's just a bird."" But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above."
Kevin,"Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny."
Pam,"And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song."
Dwight,He's not a songbird.
Michael,Shhh.
Pam,"An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten."
Angela,Amen.
Dwight,
Pam,Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
Michael,"Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown."
Dwight,Let's get back to work.
Dwight,Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
Pam,Three kitchens?
Ryan,A dime and a nickel.
Jim,Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
Dwight,"No, I said one of them is not a nickel."
Pam,"Hey, Ryan, are you ok?"
Ryan,But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Jim,Pam?
Dwight,"Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ..."
Ryan,Yeah. Yeah.
Ryan,Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Jim,Pam?
Dwight,A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
Pam,"Um. Ok, bye."
Ryan,"He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted."
Jim,"Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too."
Dwight,A hunter.
Pam,"No, I was um..."
Ryan,It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
Jim,"Oh, no no."
Dwight,Damn it!
Pam,You have to go?
Jan,Tell me what you did yesterday.
Jim,"Yeah, uh, well."
Michael,Uhhh... nothing.
Pam,"No, I should probably go too."
Jan,Nothing?
Jim,Ok.
Michael,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?"
Pam,"I mean, yeah."
Jan,I don't care how your day was Michael.
Jim,Yeah. Bye Pam.
Michael,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?"
Pam,Bye Jim.
Jan,Tell me what you did yesterday.
Stanley,"Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day."
Michael,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?
Michael,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base."
Jan,"Hi, Pam."
Pam,Hi.
Jan,"I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?"
Pam,"Oh, I don't know if I'm..."
Jan,Thanks Pam.
Pam,"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five."
Dwight,So you excited?
Ryan,Yeah.
Dwight,Very excited?
Ryan,Yes. I'm very excited.
Dwight,Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.
Ryan,"I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited."
Dwight,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?"
Ryan,"So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? So where's the sales office?"
Dwight,"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now."
Karen,Hey.
Jim,What?
Karen,My chair is squeaking.
Jim,Is it?
Karen,You took my chair.
Jim,"No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair."
Karen,"When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so..."
Jim,So I guess I can't get up.
Michael,"Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too."
Dwight,"Do you know where we are, temp?"
Ryan,I know where we're not.
Dwight,"I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. AH! When... Damn it."
Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second."
Jim,Sure.
Andy,Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
Karen,That's it? That's what you came up with?
Andy,I'm acting my heart out here.
Karen,Really?
Andy,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped."
Announcer,"Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants."
Pam,Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Michael,"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me."
Michael,"Oh, shhh... Come on."
Dwight,"And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you."
Ryan,I don't think you know what you're saying.
Dwight,"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?"
Ryan,Uh huh.
Dwight,It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Ryan,Gotcha.
Dwight,"Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back."
Ryan,Ok. Of course.
Stanley,"I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day."
Kelly,Because they acted all tough and everything...
Michael,Uh huh.
Kelly,"But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to..."
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?"
Phyllis,I'm just saying hi to Bob.
Michael,"No, I think you're cutting in line."
Bob,"Well settle down, Scott."
Michael,"No, I'm not going to settle down."
Stanley,No way.
Michael,Get in the back please.
Stanley,Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
Michael,Boooooo. Thank you.. That's right.
Bob,What a pair of Mary's.
Stanley,This is Pretzel Day.
Ryan,"Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship."
Dwight,Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Karen,
Jim,"Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,"
Karen,stop.
Jim,"Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me"
Karen,"This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please."
Jim,"fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,"
Karen,This is not a proportionate response.
Jim,"Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me."
Andy,I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Pam,Michael.
Michael,"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind."
Pam,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Michael,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
Pam,"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel."
Michael,"Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown."
Pam,"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today."
Michael,"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back."
Dwight,It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Ryan,"Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it."
Dwight,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Ryan,Yeah.
Dwight,Come on!
Stanley,Thank you!
Michael,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Pretzel guy,We do.
Michael,Thank God.
Pretzel guy,"And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar."
Michael,"Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?"
Pretzel guy,The Works. You got it.
Michael,All right! Thank you!
Dwight,Please be seated.
Ryan,Who was that?
Dwight,Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Ryan,Is that your Cousin Mose?
Dwight,Yes.
Dwight,"Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore."
Dwight,What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Ryan,Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
Dwight,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
Ryan,Depression?
Dwight,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Kelly,I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
Angela,Sales take a long time.
Kelly,"Oh my God, I'm so worried."
Angela,I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
Kelly,I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
Angela,"He's not weird, he's just individualistic."
Kelly,"No, he's a freak."
Angela,You're a freak!
Dwight,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?"
Ryan,"Um, loneliness. Maybe women."
Dwight,"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose."
Ryan,No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.
Dwight,Wrestle him to the ground.
Ryan,"No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye."
Dwight,Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Cousin Mose,"Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice."
Dwight,Where are all the animals?
Dwight,"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled."
Dwight,"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams."
Ryan,"Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call."
Dwight,Screwgun. The sales call!
Kevin,Hey! Hey!
Michael,"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?"
Dwight,"Establish time frames. Keep the phrase ""real dollars"" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much."
Ryan,"Wait, can you go back?"
Dwight,"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time."
Ryan,"Ok, I'm going to establish time frames."
Dwight,Good.
Ryan,"I'm going to put everything in terms of ""real dollars""."
Dwight,Right.
Ryan,I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Dwight,Uh huh.
Ryan,"Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing."
Dwight,Exactly. Yes.
Ryan,"I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky."
Michael,"Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second..."
Toby,Second?
Michael,"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you."
Kevin,"Account...? Michael, what is going on?"
Michael,And I will be taking questions.
Pam,"Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?"
Phyllis,What's on your suit?
Michael,"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!"
Ryan,They really didn't like me.
Dwight,They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
Ryan,I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Dwight,"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive."
Ryan,You drive.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan."
Dwight,"Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere."
Ryan,I think about that all the time.
Kevin,"Night, Pam."
Pam,Night.
Michael,"Hey, what time is it?"
Pam,20 past 5.
Michael,AM or PM?
Pam,PM.
Michael,"Oh, good."
Pam,These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
Michael,Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
Pam,This is a huge sale.
Michael,Yes. Right. Good.
Pam,"Night, Michael."
Michael,Goodnight!
Pam,Dunder Mifflin.
Jim,"Ah, hey."
Pam,Oh my God.
Jim,Hi.
Pam,Hi.
Jim,"Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing."
Pam,Oh.
Jim,"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?"
Pam,I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Jim,Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Pam,"Yeah, totally. So..."
Jim,So...
Pam,Do you...
Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead."
Pam,"Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here."
Jim,"Oh, good."
Pam,A little different. What time is it there?
Jim,"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone."
Pam,"Oh, yeah. Right."
Jim,How far away did you think we were?
Pam,I don't know. It felt far.
Jim,Yeah. I have a question for you.
Pam,What?
Jim,How many words per minute does the average person type?
Pam,I type 90.
Jim,Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Pam,It's true.
Jim,"Ok, I said average."
Pam,70? How many do you type?
Jim,Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Pam,Come on. Tell me.
Jim,No.
Pam,You have to tell me now.
Jim,"65. Ok, no need to laugh."
Pam,"No, it's, that's respectable."
Jim,Respectable?
Pam,"So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself..."
Jim,Right.
Pam,Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
Jim,Ok.
Pam,"And, I'm freaking out."
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,That movie is so scary!
Jim,I know!
Pam,But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Jim,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
Pam,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
Jim,"No, you're making this up!"
Pam,Would I make that up?
Jim,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories."
Pam,"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet."
Jim,And how many kitchens?
Pam,I have one kitchen.
Jim,"Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley."
Pam,It's actually...
Jim,Most apartments these days have like three.
Kelly,Here you go.
Michael,"Nice dress, Ryan."
Kelly,It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
Michael,OK.
Michael,"Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween."
Kelly,You look so handsome.
Pam,Really you do. I love the material.
Kelly,I know.
Michael,How come you didn't get me one?
Kelly,I...
Phyllis,"Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people."
Pam,I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Meredith,Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 's*x and the City' at my place?
Pam,"Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet."
Kelly,"I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends."
Pam,"I just feel kind of tired, you know."
Dwight,Maybe you've got mono.
Pam,Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Kelly,"Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?"
Dwight,"Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available."
Kevin,Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Roy,"I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?"
Kevin,"Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?"
Angela,Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
Michael,Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
Michael,"It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby."
Stanley,I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Michael,Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
Michael,"I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol."
Michael,"Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on."
Kelly,"Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um..."
Michael,Kelly?
Kelly,Sparkles...
Michael,Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
Kelly,"Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think."
Angela,How many gods do you have?
Kelly,"Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that."
Angela,And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
Kevin,She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Dwight,"Pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil..."
Michael,"All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'."
Jim,Sorry.
Jim,"I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work."
Karen,Nice basket.
Jim,Thank you.
Michael,"Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '"
Dwight,I see dead people.
Michael,Okay. Spoiler... alert.
Dwight,He was dead the whole time.
Michael,"Just stop it. What's the... oh, whoa! Where did that come from?"
Tony,"Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms."
Karen,Oh. Did you shake it?
Tony,"Yeah, I shook it, I shook it."
Andy,"We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I."
Jim,'Scuse me?
Andy,Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
Jim,Wow.
Andy,From 'Cheers'.
Jim,Yup.
Michael,And another thing about the Indian people... they love s*x positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
Creed,I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Meredith,"Oh, that's what they call it."
Kevin,This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Michael,"Thank you, Kevin."
Angela,I find this incredibly offensive.
Michael,"Well, I find it beautiful."
Angela,"Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it."
Michael,No...
Toby,"Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these."
Michael,"No, You're not going to collect them."
Toby,Yes.
Michael,"No. This is delightful, charming culture."
Michael,My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just s*x. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
Josh,"All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner."
Karen,Thanks.
Josh,And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
Karen,Got it.
Jim,"Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds."
Andy,You guys ready to party?
Jim,What's that?
Andy,I said are you ready TO PARTY!
Phyllis,Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
Angela,I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Kevin,Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Carol,I thought you said this was a costume party!
Michael,What does that look like to you?
Carol,An Indian woman in a sari.
Michael,No one's even going to notice.
Kevin,Nice outfit.
Michael,"Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol."
Michael,"I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions..."
Angela,I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
Server,It's all vegetarian.
Angela,I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
Michael,"Oh, yuck."
Carol,What? Too spicy?
Michael,No. These s'mores are disgusting.
Carol,They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Michael,Do you think they have any s'mores?
Michael,"All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?"
Ryan,"So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?"
Girls,Kelly Zach Braff
Ryan,What?
Kelly,"Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys."
Ryan,They said something about Zach Braff.
Kelly,Don't even listen to them. They're so...
Ryan,"No, you don't..."
Pam,Very official.
Pam,"I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?"
Dwight,Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
Kelly,I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Kelly's Mom,"Stop it right now. Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money. Wally is a whole doctor. So handsome."
Kelly,Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Kelly's Mom,He's a perfect match.
Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?"
Jim,Yep.
Andy,One. Two. Three. Shot!
Jim,"Oh, Holy Mother of God."
Andy,"Oh, that burns! Golly. Um..."
Jim,Good.
Karen,Ooh.
Overhead,"Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me."
Michael,"Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?"
Kelly's Father,Yes.
Michael,Wow.
Kelly's Father,How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Michael,"Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!"
Kelly's Mom,She is very fair.
Michael,"She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!"
Andy,One. Two. Three. Shot!
Jim,Oh.
Carol,Are you okay?
Michael,"I'm going to be. Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband."
Crowd,Awww!
Carol,"Oh, Michael."
Michael,What do you say?
Carol,Can we talk about this in private?
Michael,I didn't hear you.
Carol,Can we talk about this in private?
Michael,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay."
Michael,No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
Carol,"This is the ninth date, Michael."
Michael,"Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much."
Carol,"I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?"
Michael,Yes.
Carol,Okay.
Michael,"Ok. Okay. Good night. Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra."
Carol,"Okay, good night, Michael."
Michael,All right. Good night.
Ryan,"Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive."
Kelly's Mom,So you're saving money...
Ryan,Yes.
Kelly's Mom,...to start a family and home.
Ryan,"Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox."
Kelly's Father,Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight?
Pam,Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Young Man,"Is it? He's really outgoing, huh?"
Pam,"Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?"
Pam,It's hot in there. How's the naan?
Angela,Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Pam,I am. You should come dance with us.
Angela,I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
Pam,No one.
Andy,I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
Karen,"Andy, no acappella."
Andy,"I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain."
Andy and Jim,There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
Andy,"Wait, wait."
Andy and Jim,the less I seek my source...
Karen,"Oh, come on, guys. Please."
Andy and Jim,the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to..
Karen,It's not good.
Andy and Jim,fi-i-i-ine!
Andy,TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
Michael,"Oh, God! Oh. Wow."
Pam,Here.
Michael,That's so spicy.
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,Oh. You waiting for a call?
Pam,Uh... no.
Michael,"Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements."
Pam,"Well, you were never really engaged."
Michael,"I was in that marriage arena, though."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
Pam,I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
Michael,We're so alike. So alike.
Pam,What are you doing?
Michael,What are you doing?
Pam,I'm rejecting your...
Michael,I'm... what? I didn't
Pam,...kiss.
Michael,Can I have a ride home?
Pam,If you sit in the back.
Karen,"Goodnight, guys."
Jim,"Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike."
Andy,"No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin."
Jim,Okay.
Jim,Oh.
Karen,"Hey dummy, get in the car!"
Jim,I'm a drunk driver.
Karen,"Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car."
Jim,"Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli."
Karen,"Yeah, you can't."
Jim,"No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right."
Karen,Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Jim,So good.
Karen,Good.
Michael,These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
Pam,You say one more word
Michael,Sorry.
Michael,"This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!"
Crowd,
Karen,Hey.
Dwight,Oh my God!
Jim,Hey.
Michael,What?!
Karen,Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Dwight,
Jim,"Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain."
Michael,We did it? We did it.
Jim,"I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. ""Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."""
Dwight,We did it!
Dwight,No! You'll thank me later.
Michael and Dwight,We did it! We did it!
Michael,There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
Michael,Right here! Right here!
Jan,Michael.
Michael and Dwight,Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu!
Michael,...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
Michael,"Yeah, baby!"
Jan,Michael.
Dwight,In your face!
Michael,"Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby."
Michael,We did it!
Jan,Michael.
Dwight,"Oh, man."
Michael,Yes.
Michael,How did we do it?
Jan,I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
Dwight,I don't ... have no idea.
Michael,I don't understand.
Michael,I don't understand.
Jan,The board voted last night to close your branch.
Toby,"Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65."
Michael,On whom's authority?
Jan,The board's.
Michael,What?
Jan,"I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service."
Michael,You're welcome.
Jan,"A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages."
Michael,Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
Jan,"Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person."
Michael,"Oh... Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up."
Jan,"Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael."
Michael,Well...
Jan,It's... it's about talent.
Michael,"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?"
Jan,Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
Michael,"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?"
Michael,"It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm."
Michael,Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast.
Dwight,Hey stranger.
Michael,Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Dwight,Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
Michael,"Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can."
Dwight ,"When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, ""Something Weird is Going On."" Colon, ""What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute."""
Karen,"Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is..."
Jim,Really? Wow... that's bad.
Andy,"Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? In your face!"
Jim,"Well, I work here now."
Andy,Mmmm.. suck-ah!
Pam,Are you okay?
Michael,"Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life."
Pam,What did Jan want?
Michael,"Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so..."
Pam,What can't you tell me?
Michael,"Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway."
Pam,What?!
Michael,What?
Pam,You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Michael,Do I have any messages?
Pam,"Michael, what's going on?"
Michael,"Ok, ok..."
Michael,"Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down."
Toby,"Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made."
Michael,"You knew about this all along, didn't you?"
Toby,Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Michael,Traitor. You are a traitor.
Angela,"What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?"
Michael,I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
Ryan,It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Angela,I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
Kelly,"If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one."
Andy,"Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!"
Jim,"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans."
Stanley,I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. I really couldn't be happier.
Pam,"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, ""Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."" So, maybe that'll stop now."
Roy,What does that mean?
Kevin,"Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut."
Roy,"I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, ""You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)""? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words."
Darryl,Hey Mike.
Michael,Darryl. Noble Darryl.
Darryl,"Look, I heard about the office. Tough break."
Michael,"I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me."
Darryl,I wasn't.
Michael,"So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and..."
Darryl,"Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good."
Michael,Awesome.
Michael,This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
Michael,"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. Let's go."
Dwight,Yes!
Pam,"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight."
Michael,Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
Dwight,What's the plan?
Michael,"Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch."
Dwight,Can I drive?
Michael,No... way.
Dwight,Shotgun!
Michael,No. There's no one else.
Dwight,Still.
Dwight,"Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office."
Michael,"Okay, okay. Um..."
Dwight,"But, do not worry. I have his home address right here."
Michael,Why?
Dwight,Christmas card list.
Michael,You sent him cards? You never met him.
Dwight,"But when I do, we'll have something to talk about."
Jim,"Hey, do you have a second?"
Josh,"Sure, what's up?"
Jim,"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?"
Josh,I honestly don't. I don't know.
Jim,"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?"
Josh,"You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it."
Jim,What does that mean?
Jan,Hi.
Josh,"Jan, hey."
Jan,"Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?"
Ryan,"I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense."
Ryan,"This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best."
Michael,"Okay, this is it. This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like ""Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person."" It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else."
Jan,"So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two."
Josh,"Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely."
Jan,Awesome.
Josh,"Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job."
Jan,Wha... excuse... why not?
Josh,"As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples."
Jan,Today?
Josh,
Jan,You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
Josh,
Jan,"Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I..."
Josh,"I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done."
Jan,I'm gonna make some calls.
Jim,"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that."
Dwight,"So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?"
Michael,I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
Dwight,"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice."
Michael,All right.
Dwight,"Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work."
M ichael,"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?"
Dwight,Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Michael ,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Dwight,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents."
Michael,"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings."
Dwight,"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity"
Michael,"Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that."
Dwight,"Whoa hey, why not?"
Michael,"Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?"
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,Don't touch me this time.
Dwight,"Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work..."
Michael,"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?"
Dwight,Uh!
Jan,"So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford."
Jim,Wow.
Jan,"And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch."
Jim,Thank you.
Jan,Yeah.
Jim,"No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um..."
Jan,Michael.
Jim,"No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think."
Jan,"Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay."
Jim,Okay.
Phyllis,"Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again."
Kevin,Where are we going?
Phyllis,I thought maybe DJ's.
Kevin,How about Cugino's?
Angela,I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
Kevin,How 'bout Cooper's then?
Angela,No seafood.
Kevin,"But, I don't want to go to DJ's."
Angela,"Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?"
Phyllis,"Okay, forget it."
Kevin,Hooters?
Angela,No.
Dwight,"Ah. Here, replinish your fluids."
Michael,
Jan,Where's Michael?
Pam,He's not here. I don't know where he is.
Jan,Wha... what's going on here?
Phyllis,We know the branch is closing
Jan,"Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing"
Angela,Yes!
Kevin,Yes!
Phyllis,Stanley!
Pam,Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
Jan,"Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him."
Pam,"Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?"
Jan,Back?
Pam,Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
Jan,"Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few."
Dwight,who is it?
Michael,The office.
Dwight,Gonna get it?
Michael,"No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news."
Pam,I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
Ryan,Is Jim coming back.
Pam,"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh."
Ryan,"I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk."
Pam,"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?"
Ryan,"Oh, yeah, totally."
Kelly,"Ahhhhh! I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! This is the best day of my whole l ife!"
Karen,What you gonna do?
Jim,I really don't know. How you doing with all this?
Karen,"You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job."
Jim,You'd actually move to Scranton?
Karen,"Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would."
Jim,New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
Karen,"Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that."
Josh,Hey Andy!
Andy,"What's up, Josh?"
Josh,I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
Andy,"Thanks, man. You, too. Totally."
Michael,Anything?
Dwight,Nothing.
Michael,What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
Dwight,Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Michael,"All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go."
Dwight,My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Michael,That was hilarious. The foam ...
Dwight,"Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me."
Michael,"Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good."
Dwight,What were your favorite moments?
Michael,"Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one."
Dwight,What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Michael,"God, Dwight!"
Dwight,"Well, it doesn't..."
Kevin,"Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots."
Pam,"No thanks, guys."
Kevin,All right.
Pam,Have fun though.
Kevin,Cool.
Phyllis,"Hey, I hear Jim's coming back."
Pam,Really? Where did you hear that?
Phyllis,I was...
Kevin,"Hey Ryan, you coming?"
Ryan,"Uh yeah, we'll meet you there."
Kevin,"Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis."
Phyllis,I'll tell you later.
Pam,Okay.
Roy,"Crazy day, huh?"
Pam,Yeah.
Roy,"Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here."
Pam,"Yeah, me too."
Pam,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay."
Jim,"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it."
Karen,"Okay, yeah. Maybe I will."
Jim,Okay.
Karen,"Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go."
Michael,What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
Dwight,
Michael,"Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!"
Jim,The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
Andy,"Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?"
Andy,"That's the other thing you got to watch out... Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott."
Dwight,Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Jim,Yeah.
Andy,"Sure thing, buddy."
Andy,So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
Andy,"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm."
Jim,You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Andy,"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver."
Andy,"Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you."
Angela,Oh.
Jim,Sounds good Andy.
Andy,Do you like it?
Karen,This is going to be an adventure.
Angela,"I do like it, actually."
Jim,"Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?"
Andy,Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Karen,Right on. Hey is that Josh's computer?
Angela,Thank you.
Andy,What?
Andy,You're welcome.
Pam,Hey!
Pam,Hey.
Toby,Hey.
Jim,Hey!
Pam,How'd the run go?
Pam,What happened to grape soda?
Toby,"Ah, pretty good. I finished."
Jim,Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Pam,That's great!
Pam,Oh. You've changed so much.
Dwight,"Psh, why is that great?"
Jim,"Well, I'm evolving, Pam."
Pam,Because he accomplished something.
Pam,So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Dwight,What was your mile time?
Jim,"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled."
Toby,About seven.
Pam,"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever."
Dwight,I could beat that on a skateboard.
Jim,Okay.
Toby,"Well, that has wheels."
Michael,Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
Dwight,"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time."
Jim,Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
Pam,"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?"
Michael,All right.
Dwight,Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Jim,Don't...
Pam,Really?
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
Jim,All right. I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Dwight,"Man, what is taking Toby so long?"
Pam,"Yeah. I know, me too."
Pam,"Oh, I'll just time him later."
Jim,All right!
Dwight,And you'll compare the times?
Pam,"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good."
Pam,Yeah. Are you ready?
Hannah,Take a picture. It'll last longer.
Dwight,"No, my groin..."
Ryan,"I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting."
Pam,Set
Creed,"Ditto that, my brother."
Dwight,...is really tight.
Hannah,Look what's on his computer.
Pam,Go!
Michael,What is that? A squid's eye or...
Dwight,I can't...
Hannah,It's my left breast.
Pam,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby."
Michael,How did you...
Dwight,Aaaaah!
Creed,Right place at the right time.
Pam,I should probably get back to work.
Karen,"Uh, what's that smell?"
Michael,Here... Who's here?
Phyllis,What smell?
Dwight,Nametag?
Karen,Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Michael,"Yes, please."
Phyllis,"Oh, I'll help you find it."
Dwight,Karen Filippelli.
Karen,"Oh, you know. Never... .never mind."
Michael,Karen Filip... Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Phyllis,What is it?
Dwight,Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
Karen,"I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume."
Michael,Okay.
Phyllis,My perfume?
Michael,"My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus."
Karen,"It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells."
Michael,Who's next?
Phyllis,Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Dwight,That's Andy Bernard.
Karen,Who's Bob Vance?
Michael,Andy Bernard.
Phyllis,"You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie."
Dwight,If I were you...
Stanley,I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
Michael,Saint Bernard.
Michael,People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
Dwight,...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Michael,"I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just."
Michael,What?
Dwight,Do you have batteries?
Dwight,...before noon...
Michael,Ssshh stupid! Um...
Michael,I'm not...
Andy,
Dwight,...to consolidate power.
Michael,That's it!
Michael,I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Andy,What is love?
Dwight,"No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner."
Michael,"Yes, yes! Okay!"
Dwight,The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Andy,"Baby, don't hurt me."
Pam,Good morning!
Michael,"Okay, here we go."
Michael,"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league."
Andy & Michael,"Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!"
Pam,Okay.
Michael,Oh!
Pam,"Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back."
Andy,"Baby, don't hurt me!"
Hannah,Hello?
Michael,Oh! Oh! Oh!
Michael,Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Andy,Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Dwight,Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Michael,Scuse me! Scuse me!
Michael,Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
Andy & Michael,Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...
Michael,"You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, this says 'World's Best Dad'."
Michael,You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Michael,Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Andy,Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Tony,Gardner.
Michael,"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!"
Michael,Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. Okay.
Andy,"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy."
Tony,Thanks.
Michael,"Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor."
Kevin,"Michael, I didn't get a gift bag."
Dwight,"Very funny, Michael!"
Michael,"Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later."
Michael,Okay! Okay!
Hannah,My bag's mostly pencils.
Dwight,"Really funny, Michael!"
Michael,"Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy."
Michael,"All right, all right, I'm on a roll."
Kevin,Can I have your pencils?
Michael,Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Hannah,No.
Karen,Shouldn't we be equals?
Pam,Hi!
Michael,Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
Karen,Hi.
Tony,"Uh... this is difficult, for me."
Pam,I'm Pam.
Michael,I understand. We're all friends.
Karen,Karen. I love your sweater.
Tony,No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.
Pam,"Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me."
Michael,"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up."
Karen,Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Tony,
Michael,Welcome.
Michael,You know what? I'll help. I will...
Karen,...to knit.
Tony,"No, please. No."
Michael,"Welcome, welcome, welcome! Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader."
Michael,Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
Karen,"Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?"
Dwight,Do this. Come on. Ready?
Michael,"Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?"
Michael,Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Andy,"I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs."
Dwight,On three. One... two... three.
Andy,Hello.
Michael,"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here."
Michael,Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
Tony,All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
Andy,And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Michael,We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
Michael,"A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you."
Tony,Let me go!
Andy,"Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike."
Michael,I'm right in your crack!
Michael,Oh.
Tony,Put me down right...
Andy,Nifty!
Michael,Up and over.
Michael,They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
Tony,Put me down!
Michael,You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
Michael,Up and over.
Martin,...which is why they need a passing game.
Tony,Put me down right now!
Jim,Right.
Michael,You've got it.
Michael,"No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man."
Tony,I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"You've got it, you've got it."
Michael,"How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you."
Tony,PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
Martin,Oh! Thanks.
Michael,Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Michael,"Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not... so, your desk is..."
Dwight,"Hey, hey. Easy."
Jim,"Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here."
Michael,Easy.
Pam,Oh my god! It's really you!
Tony,I'm sorry!
Jim,"Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met..."
Michael,Don't...
Pam,I know. I don't care.
Tony,It's just not going to work for me.
Jim,Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Michael,What...
Pam,It's really good to see you.
Tony,I have to go.
Jim,"You, too."
Michael,I don't understand.
Jim,"Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand."
Tony,I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.
Dwight,"Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford."
Michael,"Well, we'll squeeze you in."
Jim,"Hey, Dwight."
Tony,I can't work here. I have to quit.
Dwight,Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Michael,"You can't quit! On the first day. That's heresy, my friend! Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?"
Jim,Okay. Sounds good.
Tony,No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
Dwight,What are you doing?
Michael,My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
Jim,I don't know what you're talking about.
Tony,No. Was it supposed to be funny?
Dwight,I have a smudge on my forehead?
Michael,"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired."
Jim,No. Looks good.
Tony,Excuse me?
Dwight,Why are you looking at my forehead?
Michael,"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!"
Jim,I'm not.
Tony,But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
Dwight,"Meet my eye line, Jim!"
Michael,"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you."
Jim,I am.
Dwight,That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
Dwight,Stop acting like an idiot!
Michael,"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight."
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Ryan,"Hey, buddy. Welcome back."
Andy,Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
Jim,Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Hannah,Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
Ryan,I'm good! How are you? So...
Angela,Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?"
Michael,"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide."
Ryan,Yeah.
Stanley,Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Jim,Oh.
Michael,No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
Ryan,"Um... unless you really, really want it back."
Michael,"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it."
Jim,"You know, man, it's really you're call."
Michael,"Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires."
Ryan,"Cool, thank you."
Dwight,What!
Jim,Let me get that for you.
Michael,Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Ryan,Yuh.
Karen,Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Jim,This one taken? No. Good.
Jim,Does he ever.
Ryan,Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
Michael,"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators."
Toby,"Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says"
Dwight,YEAH!
Kevin,"Oh, yes I can."
Michael,Yeah.
Kevin,"In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need."
Toby,I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Andy,"Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike."
Michael,"Go home, Toby. Just..."
Michael,Right.
Martin,Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
Dwight,Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Michael,"Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. ""You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"""
Andy,Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Hannah,For crying out loud.
Dwight,"So you'll be reporting to me, then."
Michael,"No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh..."
Andy,"Umm, on the contrary."
Martin,What's up with this guy?
Dwight,My title has 'Manager' in it.
Stanley,Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Andy,And I'm a director.
Michael,THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
Dwight,Oh.
Stanley,Trust me. It only gets worse.
Andy,Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Martin,Is he always like this?
Dwight,I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Ryan,Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Andy,Congratulations.
Hannah,When do people work?
Jim,"Hey, Toby!"
Phyllis,"Oh, we find little times during the day."
Toby,"Hey, Jim!"
Karen,How are we going to get home?
Jim,"How are you, man?"
Phyllis,Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Toby,"Oh, really good."
Karen,Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
Jim,I just wanted to say hi.
Michael,"See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. Jell-o!"
Toby,How are you? Hey. Welcome back.
Jan,Michael!
Jim,Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Michael,"Hi, Jan!"
Toby,"No, I'm sorry, it's..."
Jan,Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Jim,No. It's cool.
Michael,I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Toby,"No, it's nothing. We'll just..."
Jan,"Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?"
Jim,All right. Good to be back.
Michael,Yes.
Toby,So... okay.
Jan,You do?
Jim,All right.
Michael,But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Toby,All right... sorry... sorry about that.
Jan,"What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two."
Jim,No problem.
Michael,What?
Toby,It was just...
Jan,He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Jim,...what?
Michael,"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos."
Toby,Nothing.
Michael,"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two."
Kevin,This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! Shoot.
Dwight,If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Michael,I present the orientation video.
Jim,"Yeah, it does, actually."
Dwight,We need to talk!
Dwight,So who will be your new Number Three?
Michael,Not now.
Michael,Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Dwight,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Andy,"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb."
Michael,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Michael,"Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks."
Dwight,Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Dwight,And I have to say your leadership...
Michael,"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one."
Michael,Shut it...
Dwight,Ok. Who reports to who?
Dwight,has brought...
Michael,"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?"
Michael,Shut it! That's... suck up!
Dwight,And then if I want...
Jim,"Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?"
Michael,Work it out amongst your selves!
Karen,I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Dwight,I...
Jim,What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Michael,"Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?"
Karen,Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
Dwight,I...
Jim,Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Michael,Will you?
Karen,Yeah.
Dwight,One...
Jim,"Ok, thanks."
Michael,Please?
Karen,Ok.
Kelly,Jim!
Jim,Hey.
Jim,Kelly!
Pam,Hey!
Kelly,Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Jim,I thought you had already... left.
Jim,Really?
Pam,Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Kelly,"Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!"
Jim,Oh... Good.
Jim,Great. What's new with you?
Pam,What's up?
Kelly,I just told you.
Jim,"Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something."
Michael,"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please, the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!"
Pam,What do you mean?
Michael,Yoko shack.
Jim,I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Male voice,...thank you James.
Pam,Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Meredith,"Hey, champagne."
Jim,O..ok. Um..good.
Michael,"Nope, no. Guests only."
Pam,We're friends. We'll always be friends.
Kelly,Looks like salmon.
Jim,Right.
Michael,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo."
Pam,It's good to have you back.
Kelly,I eat beef.
Jim,Yeah. Good to be back.
Michael,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy."
Meredith,Where'd you get that salad?
Kevin,The beef is poisoned?
Kevin,Staples.
Michael,"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. Welcome. Help yourself."
Andy,"Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?"
Toby,Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Dwight,"Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please."
Michael,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please."
Andy,"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese."
Jim,"Oh, this looks promising."
Dwight,Xterra's not even a real word.
Pam,You won't be disappointed.
Andy,"Actually, it is. It's Latin for ""earth."""
Michael,"Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch ""Lazy Scranton""."
Dwight,"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?"
Video,
Andy,Yeah.
Michael,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'."
Dwight,That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Dwight,"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty."
Andy,"Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back."
Michael,So check out how we live
Dwight,Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
Michael & Dwight,in the Electric City!
Andy,"Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came."
Michael,They call it Scranton.
Dwight,"Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die."
Dwight,What?
Andy,"Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University."
Michael,The Electric City. Scranton.
Dwight,Idiot!
Dwight,What?
Andy,"If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm."
Michael,The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
Dwight,"If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world."
Dwight,But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Andy,Idiot!
Jim,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
Dwight,You're the idiot!
Michael,I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
Andy,Nice comeback!
Video,
Dwight,I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. Totally got the best of that interchange.
Michael,"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,"
Dwight,But the little cars go in the compact spot
Michael and Dwight,"Spot, spot, spot, spot ..."
Michael,Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Michael,"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'."
Karen,This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim,Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Karen,This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim,"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian."
Karen,Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Jim,You feel good?
Karen,Mm-hm.
Jim,All right.
Karen,Karen Filippelli.
Pam,Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
Hannah,He.
Pam,"...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink."
Hannah,That's his favorite color.
Pam,...Oh. That's... fun for him.
Stanley,Fantastic.
Michael,"Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute."
Hannah,Thank youuu.
Michael,Ohh. May I?
Hannah,"Uh, sure!"
Michael,"Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from ""Look Who's Talking."" What am I thinking? Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts."
Karen,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Karen,...Almost done?
Jim,Just about... yup. Now.
Jim,"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet."
Michael,"Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know."
Angela,"Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting."
Jan,Mmhmm.
Angela,"Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means."
Jan,We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
Michael,I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. ... I'm just kidding.
Jan,When did the check come?
Angela,Last week.
Jan,"Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move."
Angela,One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Michael,"Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby."
Angela,"Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?"
Jan,"Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line."
Pam,Who is it?
Michael,Hannah?
Kevin,Hmm.
Angela,Hmm.
Kevin,Andy.
Angela,Andy?
Kevin,Hmm. Martin?
Michael,Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
Kevin,"Wait, why am I a racist?"
Michael,Because you think he's black.
Kevin,He is black... right? And...
Michael,Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
Jan,...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
Kevin,Yeah!
Jan,Michael?
Michael,Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
Kevin,I wonder what he did.
Michael,"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened."
Pam,Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Michael,"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people."
Kevin,Cool.
Pam,Okay. Angela?
Angela,"Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that."
Michael,Good. All right.
Jim,Jim Halpert.
Andy,I am so horny.
Jim,...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
Andy,"Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack."
Jim,"She is dating Ryan, I think."
Andy,"Oh, and I care why?"
Jim,She's... high-maintenance.
Andy,"Next. How about.... Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that."
Jim,"Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one."
Andy,"Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?"
Jim,...Absolutely you should.
Andy,Jackpot.
Michael,Just... try to be cool.
Dwight,I am cool.
Michael,"Okay, are you cool, really?"
Dwight,"I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on."
Michael,"Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!"
Dwight,"I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals."
Andy,"All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?"
Jim,"I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates..."
Jim,Frisbee-based competitions...
Andy,Are you kidding?
Jim,She...
Andy,I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
Jim,"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?"
Michael,"Hey Martin, how's it going?"
Martin,"Good. Getting settled, you know?"
Michael,"Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust."
Pam,My dad.
Michael,...Danny Glover. Yeah.
Jim,Jonas Salk.
Michael,Who?
Jim,Justin Timberlake?
Michael,Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
Karen,Hey I got one.
Michael,Yup.
Karen,Jesus.
Michael,Apollo Creed.
Michael,"Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you."
Martin,So... you all wanna know what I was in for?
Michael,No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
Martin,"Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink."
Michael,That is awesome.
Kevin,"I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day."
Pam,What was prison like?
Martin,Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.
Kevin,You got outdoors time?
Martin,"Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games..."
Kevin,"Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?"
Pam,"Yeah, some days I never go outside."
Michael,"Well, we are running a business, so."
Meredith,What was your cell like?
Martin,"Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes."
Pam,They have art classes?
Martin,Yeap. Yeah.
Ryan,They have business classes there?
Martin,"They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business."
Pam,Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
Michael,Ah. Well. That's not true.
Kevin,I would so rather be in prison.
Ryan,Prison sounds great.
Michael,No you would not.
Michael,This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
Creed,Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
Karen,You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
Creed,"Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?"
Andy,"Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?"
Pam,Wow... I--
Andy,Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
Pam,Wow. That was... wow.
Michael,"Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!"
Pam,"Michael, it's freezing out."
Phyllis,I can't feel my toes.
Michael,Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
Jim,"What is that, like... five pounds?"
Michael,"It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone."
Stanley,I'm going back inside.
Michael,"Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time."
Michael,Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
Martin,"Yeah, in the rec room."
Michael,Ah. A ten inch black and white?
Martin,"Actually, our TV was bigger than that one."
Michael,These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
Jim,Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
Andy,Yeah.
Jim,Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Andy,I play the banjo.
Jim,"Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?"
Andy,"You know I can, my man."
Jim,Yup. That's perfect.
Karen,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Andy,I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
Jim,Perfect.
Karen,What is going on?
Jim,...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Karen,I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
Jim,"...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but..."
Karen,Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Jim,"Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else."
Michael,"All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say ""Boo"" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!"
Angela,Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
Michael,"Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!"
Ryan,"Michael, please."
Jim,Where... did you learn all of this?
Michael,Internet.
Jim,"So, not prison."
Michael,"And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office."
Jim,"What'd you do, Prison Mike?"
Michael,I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
Jim,"That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike."
Michael,"And I nevah got caught, neither."
Jim,"Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm."
Pam,Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Michael,"Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair."
Andy,Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
Michael,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks."
Dwight,Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
Angela,"Don't encourage him, Dwight."
Michael,"The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!"
Karen,Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
Michael,"No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?"
Pam,"Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you."
Martin,"Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison."
Michael,"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go."
Jim,"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out."
Michael,"No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas."
Kevin,Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Hannah,Shh!
Toby,This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Toby,Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
Michael,"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt."
Toby,"Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will."
Michael,"Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so."
Toby,"You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny."
Michael,"Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!"
Michael,"Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black."
Andy,"So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee..."
Dwight,Merry Christmas!
Pam,Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
Dwight,It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?
Dwight,"Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead."
Michael,"I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out..."
Pam,"Dwight, what uh..."
Andy,No.
Dwight,I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
Dwight,Who are you calling?
Pam,"Well, get it out of here."
Michael,I'm just gonna call her.
Dwight,"Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?"
Andy,"Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, we need your help."
Jim,Merry Christmas Dwight.
Waitress,What can I get for 'ya?
Dwight,Jim.
Andy,I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes.
Jim,Wow. What have we got here?
Andy,"One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal."
Dwight,What does it look like?
Phyllis,"You should, you should put out salt for the rims"
Jim,Dead goose.
Pam,That's a great idea.
Dwight,And circle gets the square.
Angela,Phyllis?
Jim,All right.
Phyllis,I was just getting a snack.
Dwight,So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
Pam,You can have your snack in here.
Toby,"Oh, Dwight, we talked about this."
Angela,"Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis."
Dwight,"No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead."
Phyllis,OK.
Dwight,"Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed."
Kevin,"I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know."
Dwight,"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease."
Ryan,I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
Jim,Wow. Win-Win.
Roy,So I only use three?
Dwight,"Exactly. Thank you, Jim."
Pam,"If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong."
Phyllis,I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
Roy,OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
Creed,That's crazy. It's crazy.
Pam,"Oh, I just get those at any party supply place."
Toby,"Dwight, you cannot keep that here."
Roy,"OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?"
Dwight,"Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas."
Pam,"Oh yeah, your mom would love that."
Toby,"Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour."
Roy,"Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later."
Dwight,It's Christmas Toby.
Pam,Bye.
Toby,It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
Karen,He's cute. You should date him.
Dwight,Toby...
Pam,"Oh, yeah... Maybe."
Toby,I'm sorry.
Dwight,Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Dwight,Please? Please?
Chef,"No, it's Usuba."
Toby,Clean it in your car.
Dwight,"Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though."
Pam,I would like it off my desk.
Chef,"Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity."
Dwight,Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
Dwight,"Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better."
Michael,"Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. 'Tis the ... ack. Hey! I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint..."
Woman at bar,I think he'd know.
Pam,"Can I help you, Michael?"
Michael,Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
Michael,I'm looking for the toy drive box.
Andy,"Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?"
Pam,It's behind you.
Cindy,I don't know.
Michael,"OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks."
Michael,"Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour."
Jim,Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Andy,"You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. Watch, watch, watch, watch. Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?"
Michael,Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
Michael,You're right. That's good.
Kevin,The tires look pretty worn.
Pam,Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
Michael,"Well, that is probably from the test drive."
Angela,I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!
Jim,"But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?"
Angela,I need to know if I can start the party?
Michael,No.
Dwight,"Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!"
Andy,"Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike."
Andy,This drink...
Michael,"Oh, thanks."
Michael,I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Pam,Michael?
Angela,Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Michael,"Yes? Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that."
Dwight,Start the party.
Pam,"I didn't, it's from corporate."
Angela,"Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now"
Michael,OK. Did everybody get one of these?
Pam,Our party is also starting now
Pam,Yup.
Karen,Yup.
Michael,Terrific. Good.
Karen,All right Stanley. Woo.
Michael,"This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah."
Pam,Good choice.
Jim,"Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed."
Angela,Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Creed,And a happy holiday to you.
Hannah,Why would I be disappointed?
Jim,Carol.
Angela,I said you wouldn't be disappointed.
Carol,"Hi, is Michael around here?"
Angela,"Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry."
Michael,There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde.
Meredith,Is that a threat?
Carol,Michael.
Angela,"No, it's an invitation."
Michael,"Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side."
Pam,We have vodka!
Carol,What?
Karen,Lots of it!
Michael,"Turn around, turn around. Come on."
Kevin,I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela Hmmm...
Carol,Get outta here.
Angela,Brownies. Cupcakes.
Michael,"No, you get outta here."
Kevin,Don't push it.
Andy,Michael
Karen,"Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. What?"
Michael,Yes.
Pam,I got goose bumps.
Andy,If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
Angela,"I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good."
Dwight,"Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her."
Michael,"Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. I see steak."
Michael,Thank you.
Man,Excuse me.
Carol,I really need a moment alone with you.
Michael,"Excuse me Ah, un guard. Family style."
Michael,Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. Berp.
Jim,"No, it's not."
Carol,What is this?
Andy,"Cindy, Cindy."
Michael,"That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings."
Michael,I don't think... I love it!
Carol,"No. See, we never went on a ski trip."
Andy,"I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day."
Michael,I know.
Michael,I don't know what he's doing.
Carol,I went on a ski trip.
Andy,This is great.
Michael,Right.
Dwight,Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
Carol,Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Jim,"Oh, she's asleep."
Michael,"Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart..."
Dwight,Oh... Narcolepsy.
Carol,Michael.
Jim,Probably.
Michael,And next to your kids. What?
Andy,Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Carol,This is so weird.
Cindy,"I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft..."
Michael,I don't understand?
Dwight,"Oh my gosh, now she's up."
Jim,"It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is bold the right word?"
Jim,"And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it."
Carol,I think you're a really sweet guy.
Dwight,"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers."
Michael,OK
Jim,"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing."
Carol,"But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us."
Kelly,What d'ya think?
Michael,"No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in Jamaica's largest fresh water pool."
Stanley,Fruity and delicious.
Carol,What are you talking about?
Kelly,"See, I told you. You want one Meredith?"
Michael,"I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow.. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is."
Meredith,No thanks. They're too sweet.
Carol,"Oh, no. Michael."
Karen,"Hey, so what's the status."
Michael,And it's all inclusive.
Ryan,Looks like they forgot the power cord.
Carol,Michael...
Pam,What?
Michael,Yes.
Karen,"Oh, you're kidding me?"
Carol,I'm sorry.
Ryan,No.
Michael,"No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over."
Karen,"Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine."
Carol,I know.
Kelly,Well that blows.
Pam,"Psst. Jim. Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you."
Darryl,"Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer."
Jim,What?
Everybody,Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Pam,For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.
Phyllis,Hi.
Jim,Are you serious?
Darryl,"Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party."
Pam,"They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell."
Phyllis,"Oh, ok."
Jim,"Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow."
Darryl,All right. Se you later...
Pam,So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. Sorry I didn't wrap it.
Hannah,These nuts are really hard to crack.
Jim,"You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?"
Angela,Try harder then. Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
Pam,Oh.
Kevin,You've got to be kidding!
Jim,"No, because of the promotion."
Angela,You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
Pam,Oh yeah.
Phyllis,"Cold, huh?"
Jim,"It just feels a little bit, like..."
Ryan,Huh?
Pam,"No, I get it, of course. OK."
Phyllis,Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
Jim,"I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?"
Andy,"They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!"
Michael,I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
Michael,You know what we should do?
Stanley,You can't cancel a holiday.
Andy,What?
Michael,Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
Michael,We should invite them to the Christmas party.
Stanley,What does that mean?
Andy,"Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy."
Michael,"Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley."
Michael,"Oh, you are such mench my friend."
Pam,"Michael, what's going on?"
Michael,"OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend."
Michael,Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
Jim,"I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too."
Jim,Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
Michael,The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
Kevin,That's not fair.
Second Cindy,That rocks.
Dwight,Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Michael,"Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours."
Michael,Fine! Have your party. Just no guests.
Second Cindy,"Thanks! I, I wanna give you something."
Phyllis,But we invited guests.
Michael,Oh. That's what she said.
Michael,"Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess."
Michael,Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
Michael,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts."
Andy,My new girlfriend.
Pam,I know.
Angela,Where's Dwight?
Michael,It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
Second Cindy,Is he the hot one or the giant baby?
Pam,"OK, well, why are you laying like that?"
Michael,"The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame."
Michael,Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
Phyllis,There's another party in the break room.
Pam,Like what?
Michael,"Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room."
Michael,"Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?"
Angela,"Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that?"
Pam,"Well.. um I, I don't..."
Second Cindy,I thought I could have it.
Michael,And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
Angela,You can't have it I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Pam,I don't need to know.
Michael,Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
Dwight,"Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short."
Dwight,Hey! It's Angela! Hey!
Michael,Take it from Toby.
Michael,We're going to ...
Dwight,Copy.
Kevin,I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Michael,"Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?"
Michael,"I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. And... my question to you is do you agree?"
Pam,"No, thank you."
Other waitress,Do I agree about what?
Michael,It's all... OK.
Michael,Do you agree about what? Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.
Toby,Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- Why?
Other waitress,What're you talking about?
Angela,"Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch."
Michael,What're you talking about?
Phyllis,I thought you said green was whorish.
Kevin,"And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know."
Angela,"No, orange is whorish."
Jim,All right
Karen,"Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ...."
Angela,Did you have fun at Benihana's?
Angela,It would never work here.
Dwight,No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.
Karen,"Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ..."
Angela,I've had the worse day here
Angela,No.
Karen,"Dwight, you won the raffle!"
Karen,A Christmas drinking game ...
Dwight,No... way! Yeah!
Meredith,Yes.
Karen,Open it! Open it ! Open it!
Angela,God help you.
Dwight,Oh.
Karen,What?
Karen,Do you like it?
Angela,"These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of ""A Nutcracker Christmas."" I think you should leave."
Dwight,Walkie-talkies.
Karen,You're kidding.
Pam,Can I talk to you a second?
Angela,"You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please. Thank you. OK, thank you very much."
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,What are you doing?
Karen,Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Dwight,We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Pam,In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Andy,"Hey, what's the haps?"
Karen,"Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties."
Michael,Carol?
Angela,I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
Dwight,"Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box."
Pam,"Yeah, but we don't have a power cord."
Dwight,Why don't you just buy the whole song?
Angela,"Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. Is it this one?"
Michael,I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
Pam,Mmm. Hmm.
Dwight,"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie."
Karen,"Yeah, thanks."
Michael,Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
Pam,We'll go tell everyone.
Michael,"This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her."
Karen,OK.
Pam,"I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her."
Andy and Michael,"And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland. Your body is a wonderland."
Pam,"Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy."
Andy,Your hands.
Karen,"Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go."
Both,Your body is a wonderland.
Pam,"Um, usually like that."
Andy,I'll use my hands on it.
Karen,Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
Both,Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face...
Pam,I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
Kelly,"Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan..."
Karen,Right.
Michael,"When you know, you just know."
Pam,"Um, I really liked your karaoke idea."
Kevin,Right.
Karen,"Oh cool, yeah."
Michael,Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Pam,That could really be fun.
Roy,Which one is she?
Karen,"Oh, thank you."
Michael,It's... it's one of those two.
Pam,You guys do a raffle?
Roy,You don't know?
Karen,"Yeah, we do a raffle..."
Kevin,"Dude, you should know."
Toby,Hey Kev.
Michael,"Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike."
Kevin,Hey.
Michael,I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
Angela,This should've been up yesterday.
Michael,"Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her."
Phyllis,It'll be all right.
Second Cindy,You know where I am.
Angela,"What is that? The ""Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?"" There's no such thing as the ""Committee to Plan Parties."""
Michael,"Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile"
Pam,There is now. We just started it.
Second Cindy,Oh.
Angela,"Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding."
Michael,"Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party."
Karen,What's your funding?
Creed,"Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya..."
Angela,Two hundred dollars.
Dwight,"Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?"
Pam,What's ours again?
Angela,"Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?"
Karen,"Umm, two hundred and one dollars."
Karen,No way.
Pam,Oh right.
Jim,"What a horrible, horrible movie that was."
Kelly,"Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun."
Karen,And now we get to remember it forever.
Angela,"No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock."
Jim,Thank you.
Kevin,Then why are there two flyers?
Karen,Thank you.
Karen,"Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three."
Second Cindy,Hey.
Kevin,Right.
Michael,"Hey, hey, you. How are ya?"
Karen,And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
Second Cindy,"Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave."
Pam,"Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer."
Michael,"No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and..."
Kevin,I didn't see where it was.
Second Cindy,Cool...
Jim,"Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?"
Michael,Where do you wanna go?
Karen,I think that's a really good option...
Second Cindy,I... We're just gonna take off.
Dwight,Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
Michael,"I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica."
Pam,You can't do that.
Second Cindy,No... I have school.
Dwight,"As ranking number three in this office, I am order -"
Michael,You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
Andy,Umm... I'm number three.
Second Cindy,Merry Christmas.
Dwight,You're number four.
Dwight,"Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed..."
Andy,"Yeah, but I'm number three."
Michael,That waitress was the one.
Dwight,"Ah, no. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth."
Jim,No. She wasn't.
Jim,"OK, I think I can help here."
Michael,How can you be sure?
Dwight,"Ok, good"
Jim,"Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately three hours ago."
Jim,"As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now."
Michael,Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
Dwight,"OK, this is stupid."
Jim,Sorry.
Jim,Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid.
Michael,"I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm."
Dwight,"No no, no, wait, wait, wait Permission to join the Validity Committee."
Jim,You what?
Jim,Permission denied.
Michael,"I, I put a mark on her arm. So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!"
Dwight,Damn it!
Jim,Yeah.
Andy,"Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. C'mon, my treat."
Michael,"Oh, why do I feel like crap?"
Michael,All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
Jim,You just had a rebound.
Andy,"That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too."
Michael,I had rebound? Yeah.
Michael,Hooters?
Jim,"Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart."
Andy,"No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too."
Michael,"I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o."
Michael,"Ah, I need my entourage Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters."
Angela,"Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.."
Ryan,"Ah man, I can't."
Michael,"Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive..."
Michael,Why not?
Angela,"... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum"
Ryan,"I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night."
Oscar,Too soon.
Michael,"Ok, feel better."
Angela,"I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum."
Ryan,Thanks.
Dwight,pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
Michael,"C'mon Jim, let's go."
Dwight,Bye Pam.
Jim,"OK. Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude."
Pam,Night.
Ryan,"Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back."
Jim,"Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents."
Michael,Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
Pam,We should get him a bus ticket. To make his trip easier.
Andy,"So she looks really hot, so I said, ""You look hotter than usual today."" Thank you. Michael Head of the table."
Jim,"Oh no, that would be great."
Dwight,"Get out Jim. Actually, um... Sir, I'm going to need take this chair."
Pam,It costs seventy five dollars.
Michael,"Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy."
Jim,"Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?"
Andy,"So she looks at me right, and she goes, ""I'm sorry, don't I even know you?"" After a year, a year of buying lattes from her, do you believe that?"
Pam,Ohh...
Jim,Yes.
Dwight,"What the? ""You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone."" Destroy phone?"
Dwight,I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
Michael,Carol used to drink lattes.
Dwight,What're you talking about?
Michael,She would get this little foam mustache...
Dwight,Carol had a mustache?
Michael,"And I used to say ""Hey, got latte?"" And she'd say, that's not funny."
Dwight,What are you guys talking about?
Michael,She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
Dwight,Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
Jim,"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... what is this?"
Dwight,Tape recorder.
Jim,For what?
Dwight,For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Jim,"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?"
Karen,"Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment."
Jim,"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?"
Dwight,What?
Jim,You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
Dwight,I'm not.
Jim,"Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!"
Dwight,I do not have a knife!
Jim,"No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!"
Dwight,Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
Jim,Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
Dwight,Give me it. I am not.
Phyllis,"Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly..."
Dwight,"Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK."
Karen,"Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?"
Jim,"Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies."
Dwight,You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
Andy,I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
Michael,"Hey, mon!"
Pam,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
Michael,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax."
Pam,OK.
Michael,"Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later."
Pam,It's kind of serious.
Michael,Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
Pam,How was Jamaica?
Michael,"It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says ""Hey mon,"" everybody says ""Hey mon"" back."
Stanley,"Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here."
Michael,"Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too."
Stanley,My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
Michael,"OK, well payroll is in charge of all that."
Stanley,They said I should talk to you.
Michael,"Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna..."
Stanley,I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
Michael,You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
Jim,You want to talk about it?
Karen,Nope.
Karen,"I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a ""for rent"" sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away."
Michael,"Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing."
Pam,That's good.
Michael,"You know, I had never been out of the country before now?"
Pam,Huh.
Michael,"Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time."
Pam,It's kind of an impoverished country.
Michael,"Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three."
Pam,"But you can't today, we're doing inventory."
Michael,Inventory's at the end of December.
Pam,"We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed."
Michael,I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
Michael,"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?"
Michael,"Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it."
Angela,By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Michael,"The Jamaicans don't have a word for ""impossible."""
Jim,"Yep, it's English, it's ""impossible."""
Angela,"Michael, there's no way we can do it in time."
Michael,"How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need."
Michael,"Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? ""No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem."" This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem."
Pam,Oh my God. Is that Jan?
Everybody,What? Where?
Pam,On the left.
Everybody,"Oh yeah, oh my God."
Michael,"No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue."
Michael,"Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. s*x. We had s*x. I had s*x with her. I had s*x with Jan."
Michael,Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Packer,Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
Michael,"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay."
Packer,You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
Michael,"Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim."
Packer,They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
Michael,Oh no?
Packer,No.
Michael,"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?"
Packer,"Well, no. I got nothing."
Michael,Check it again. Hit refresh.
Packer,"Yeah, Mike, still nothing."
Michael,"OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... Packer@DunderMifflin.com. Packaging@DunderMifflin.com. Uh oh."
Packer,"Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?"
Michael,Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
Roy,He's in the office.
Michael,"OK, Hey, man, how's it going?"
Darryl,"All right, what's up Mike?"
Michael,"That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?"
Darryl,Yup.
Michael,"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not ""packaging."" Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?"
Darryl,Uh huh.
Michael,"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it."
Darryl,Yup.
Michael,And you sent that out to everyone?
Darryl,"Mike, I'm very busy down here."
Jim,Yikes.
Kevin,Already sent it to you my friend.
Jim,Fantastic.
Andy,Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,You OK?
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,You sure?
Jim,"Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen."
Pam,Oh. You want to talk about it?
Jim,Really?
Michael,I have a special assignment for you.
Dwight,Who's the target?
Michael,"A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is ""Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."""
Dwight,What's it of?
Michael,Not important.
Dwight,"Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment."
Michael,"OK, forget it."
Dwight,"OK, I accept it."
Jim,"So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much."
Pam,Hmm.
Jim,"Hmm, what?"
Pam,"How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?"
Jim,"Yeah, I guess."
Pam,"Honestly, I think you should go easy on her."
Pam,"No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah."
Jim,"Hey, thanks a lot."
Pam,"Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!"
Jim,"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?"
Toby,Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Michael,"Not now, not ever."
Toby,About you and Jan.
Michael,"Aww, none of your business."
Toby,"Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship."
Michael,"That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops."
Toby,"Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now."
Michael,This is probably the icebreaker you need.
Toby,"You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR."
Michael,"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv."
Toby,"All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it."
Michael,"No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?"
Toby,"All right, thanks Michael."
Michael,OK.
Angela,"OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping."
Karen,What are the ingredients of poi?
Phyllis,"I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs."
Angela,Did you try the petting zoo?
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you."
Michael,"Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat."
Pam,"He'll call you back. OK, great."
Michael,She bought it? OK. OK.
Dwight,Michael hit a deer?
Dwight,Michael! Michael! There's an emergency in the warehouse.
Michael,There an accident? Somebody hurt?
Dwight,"No, it's... involves the photograph."
Michael,"Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no."
Roy,"Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done."
Michael,All right.
Roy,"That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!"
Michael,"Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---"
Kevin,Jan.
Michael,"No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe..."
Jim,Urkel Grue.
Michael,"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?"
Michael,"Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!"
Pam,Hey.
Michael,Hey.
Pam,What are you doing out here?
Michael,Island living. You know?
Pam,Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
Michael,Did she say what it's about?
Pam,That's all she said.
Andy,Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot
Jim,"Uh, I think you dropped this"
Karen,You sure?
Jim,Definitely.
Dwight,I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Michael,There are copies in the bathroom?
Dwight,There were. A lot of them.
Michael,All right.
Karen,I think I owe you one.
Pam,Sorry?
Karen,For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Pam,"Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous."
Karen,"Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously."
Pam,Sure.
Darryl,"Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up You see that? This is the greatest night of my life."
Dwight,Who did this to you? Where is he?
Pam,"What? No, it's not... it's nothing."
Dwight,It's hot in here.
Pam,Yeah.
Dwight,Yeah.
Pam,Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
Dwight,"I know. So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?"
Jan,Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
Michael,Guh.
Kevin,"Hi Jan, you look... tan."
Jan,I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Kevin,Yeah. How was it?
Jan,"Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office."
Michael,"OK, yup."
Jan,"Why am I here, Michael?"
Michael,I...
Jan,"In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?"
Michael,I... I... Yes.
Jan,"I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself."
Michael,"OK, yeah."
Jan,"This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks."
Michael,Who is Dr. Perry? I...
Jan,"This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you."
Michael,"And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well."
Jan,"Good, good."
Michael,"So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh..."
Jan,"Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time..."
Michael,"Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -"
Jan,"Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo."
Michael,"Jan, you... complete... me."
Jan,"Oh, God."
Roy,"Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?"
Pam,Yeah.
Roy,"I was definitely right. Oh, brother."
Kevin,What am I going to do? I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art.
Michael,"Jim, could you come in here please?"
Michael,"Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard."
Harvey,"Hi, Jim."
Dwight,That's what she said.
Jim,Hello.
Michael,Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
Harvey,"I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks."
Dwight,It's going to be ok.
Michael,"Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him."
Angela,"How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business."
Jim,"Yeah, you can."
Dwight,That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
Michael,You know what? Get Pam.
Angela,I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
Jim,For this?
Dwight,"Well, I don't have a lot of choices."
Michael,Pam.
Karen,"So, let me ask you a question."
Harvey,"Pam, you look very hot today."
Jim,Ok.
Jim,"Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend."
Karen,Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
Pam,Great.
Jim,"Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?"
Harvey,Me so horny. Me love you long tim.
Karen,I moved here from Connecticut...
Michael,"Oh, that is gross."
Jim,"Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?"
Pam,Who is 'Long Tim'?
Karen,'Kay.
Michael,Damn it.
Dwight,"Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... ."
Harvey,Long time. Me lobe yoy long time.
Andy,"Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp."
Jim,"Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?"
Dwight,I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Pam,I would love to meet Long Tim.
Michael,Good luck.
Jim,Yeah. Right?
Ryan,"Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed."
Pam,Yeah.
Angela,"Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had."
Harvey,"You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive."
Dwight,"One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered."
Jim,Ok.
Jim,Hey man.
Pam,Ok. Bye Harvey.
Karen,What happened on your sales call?
Harvey,Boobs.
Andy,"Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... Hello? Pretty good."
Kevin,Angela.
Angela,What?
Kevin,That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Angela,They arrived this morning.
Kevin,Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Angela,Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
Kevin,... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Andy,"Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river."
Angela,Everything ok?
Dwight,Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Angela,Thank you. I... I don't want those.
Michael,"Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you."
Andy,"Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
Michael,"Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first."
Andy,"Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott."
Michael,Oh.
Andy,Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
Michael,"Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you."
Andy,"Well, it is very gracious of you to accept."
Michael,"Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior."
Phyllis,We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Karen,"Oh, uh, thanks."
Michael,"Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley."
Stanley,Pass.
Michael,You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
Stanley,... I'll take the kid.
Ryan,"I am very flattered. I was his second choice after ""Pass."""
Michael,So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
Dwight,"Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?"
Jim,Yup. I'll trade.
Jim,"Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot."
Andy,Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
Michael,Dwight?
Dwight,Yup?
Michael,Here ya go.
Dwight,Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
Michael,Please.
Andy,He does your laundry?
Michael,"Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the ""Amazing Race."" And you guys are the retired marines. And you guys are the mother and daughter. And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?"
Karen,"Wait, ""Amazing Race"" like, the biggest sale wins?"
Michael,"No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back."
Ryan,Is there a prize?
Michael,Just bragging rights.
Phyllis,"Then how is this ""Amazing Race""?"
Michael,"It's just... brrrrrr... It's ""Amazing Race,"" Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it."
Dwight,Come on!!
Phyllis,Michael.
Michael,"Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!"
Andy,Bueno.
Phyllis,Do you have a pole?
Karen,Let's go get a broom.
Jim,Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
Dwight,"Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first."
Michael,Here we go.
Andy,"In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."
Andy,What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
Michael,"Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment."
Andy,"Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder."
Angela,Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
Pam,Really?
Angela,"Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun."
Pam,Ok. Sure.
Angela,Ok.
Karen,"Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?"
Phyllis,Um-hmmm.
Ryan,"Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?"
Stanley,You want the lead?
Ryan,"Yeah, if you don't mind."
Stanley,Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
Dwight,Leave the keys.
Jim,You still do that thing?
Dwight,Leave the keys!
Andy,"I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?"
Michael,Hawkman.
Andy,My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Michael,Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
Jim,After you sir.
Dwight,"No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear."
Jim,"Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front."
Dwight,"Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with..."
Pam,"Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time."
Angela,This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
Pam,That's great.
Angela,"Yes, it is. Hello?"
Michael,"Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?"
Buyer,Yep.
Michael,"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big."
Andy,Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
Michael,"You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency."
Andy,"Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York."
Buyer,"Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past."
Michael,"I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company."
Andy,"Oh, man, that is, like, poetry."
Michael,No.
Andy,"I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree."
Michael,Stop it. Stop it.
Andy,Ow.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. This is Pam. I did?"
Andy,"Oh man. Talk about your classic ""Lame dash O."" Do we even want that guy buying our paper?"
Michael,Yes.
Andy,I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
Michael,"Ah, no. Don't worry about it."
Andy,I really 'Schruted' it.
Michael,What?
Andy,"'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?"
Michael,I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
Phyllis,It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Karen,"Yeah, thank you."
Phyllis,"Hey, how's Annie?"
Kenny,"Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?"
Julius,Stanley Hudson.
Stanley,"Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?"
Julius,"Great, great, great."
Guy,Stanley.
Stanley,So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
Ryan,Hi.
Stanley,I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
Ryan,Um... Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Julius,"Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?"
Ryan,Oh...
Jim,We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Man,'Kay. 'Kay.
Dwight,Can I use your phone?
Man,"Yeah, sure, go ahead."
Dwight,Thanks.
Jim,"Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked."
Dwight,One...
Jim,We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
Dwight,Three...
Jim,"And, also, any forms that you are going to need..."
Dwight,Seven...
Jim,We can custom make them.
Pam,Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
Pam,"Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today."
Kevin,How much did you win?
Pam,$100.00 
Kevin,I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Pam,Cool. Congratulations.
Kevin,"Thanks, so sweet."
Stanley,"Ha ha ha! And you just said, ""Hi! Hi! Hi!"" Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!"
Man,"We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys."
Dwight,Sure.
Jim,"Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?"
Man,It's very.
Phone,"Please keep holding, your call is very important to us."
Dwight,"Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time."
Jim,And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
Kelly,"Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly."
Jim,"Hey, Kelly, it's Jim."
Kelly,"Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... ."
Dwight,"Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays."
Man,"All right, I get it. We got a deal."
Jim,Thanks.
Pam,"Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest."
Angela,That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
Pam,Oh.
Angela,I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
Pam,Oh?
Angela,Mmm-hmm.
Pam,Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
Angela,Well then. Have a nice day.
Karen,Thanks. That was fun.
Phyllis,"Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person."
Karen,Thank you.
Phyllis,I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
Karen,That's nice.
Phyllis,You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Andy,Hey boss. Got a minute?
Michael,"Yes, Andy."
Andy,"I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?"
Michael,He didn't say.
Andy,"That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?"
Michael,"No, you are remembering it wrong."
Michael,"Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three."
Dwight,I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Jim,"Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence."
Dwight,My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
Jim,We should go on a double date.
Dwight,No thank you.
Jan,"Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote ""Beeswax. Not yours, Inc."""
Michael,I knew it.
Andy,"Oh, doggie."
Karen,"Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?"
Jim,Sure. Look at you!
Karen,Yeah.
Jim,"Beesley, coffee?"
Pam,"No, thanks. I had some already."
Jim,All right.
Pam,"Oh, but, hey, Jim."
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,I won an art contest today.
Jim,No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.
Pam,Thanks.
Jim,Which one was it?
Pam,I sent in one of my watercolors.
Jim,Cool.
Pam,It was the new one I did.
Jim,Oh
Karen,You ready Jim?
Jim,Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,Congratulations.
Pam,Thanks.
Jim,Big deal.
Dwight,"Hey, we nailed the sale!"
Michael,Where were you this morning?
Dwight,I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
Michael,"Why do you lie, liar?"
Dwight,I am not a liar.
Michael,You are lying right now.
Andy,It sure seems like he is lying.
Dwight,"Stay out of this, you!"
Michael,"I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing."
Dwight,"Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company."
Dwight,I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
Dwight,"For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts"
Dwight,I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Dwight,"How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable."
Dwight,There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
Dwight,"I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over."
Andy,Big Turkey.
Jim,Is that you singing?
Andy,All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
Jim,Nice job.
Andy,Thank you muchly.
Jim,You gonna answer it?
Andy,I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
Jim,Yikes.
Andy,Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
Jim,Thank you.
Andy,"I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. Andy and the tuna..."
Jim,"I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win."
Michael,"Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover."
Andy,The cost of doing business.
Michael,"Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman..."
Andy,Was the top salesman...
Michael,I said 'was'.
Andy,Addition by subtraction.
Michael,What does that even mean? That is impossible.
Andy,Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
Michael,"But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits."
Oscar,"Hey, everyone."
Kevin,"Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?"
Oscar,"Oh, that's very funny."
Kevin,"Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left."
Oscar,"Hi, Angela."
Angela,Oscar.
Andy,"Hey, boss."
Michael,"Hey, what's up."
Andy,Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
Michael,Yep.
Andy,"Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my ""Lost"" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?"
Michael,I don't know. Maybe.
Andy,"Well, I will take that as a maybe. Where are you going?"
Michael,Bathroom.
Andy,"Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you."
Andy,"Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss."
Angela,Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Oscar,The one of all women?
Angela,Yeah.
Oscar,Because I'm gay?
Angela,No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
Oscar,"OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you."
Angela,Thank you.
Kevin,Can I join too?
Angela,Never.
Staples Guy,You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.
Dwight,Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Michael,Wow. What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Pam,Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Michael,Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Pam,"Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight."
Michael,Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
Andy,"Feel ya, dawg."
Michael,"Yeah, do you?"
Andy,Absolutely.
Michael,What did I say?
Andy,You said...
Michael,Huh.
Andy,"Which is like, ""Right on."" And Pam was like ""blah blah blah"" and you were like ""Yeah, psht."" Nailed it."
Michael,"Oh, no."
Andy,"Oh, no."
MIchael,"Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for ""being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me."" I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness."
Oscar,I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Michael,"No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific."
Oscar,Michael --
Michael,"No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga."
Oscar,Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Michael,"Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one."
Dwight,Need any help?
Lady,"Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking."
Dwight,Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
Lady,Okay.
Andy,"I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. Whizzzzz. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!"
Jim,Hey.
Karen,Hey.
Jim,So Andy is in rare form today.
Karen,"Yeah, you should not encourage him."
Jim,"Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something."
Karen,"Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't."
Jim,Fine. Party pooper.
Michael,Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
Andy,185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!
Jim,"Hey, Ryan?"
Ryan,What?
Jim,You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
Ryan,"Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago."
Jim,I liked you better when you were the temp.
Ryan,"Yeah, me too."
Michael,Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Phyllis,Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Michael,"Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?"
Stanley,"Oh, sure, we talk all the time."
Michael,Really?
Stanley,No.
Michael,"Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close."
Phyllis,No. Sorry.
Phyllis,Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Paris,Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.
Dwight,I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
Paris,"So um, where were you workin' before this?"
Dwight,Dunder-Mifflin.
Paris,What kind of company is that?
Dwight,Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
Paris,I never heard of 'em.
Dwight,Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Paris,"You gonna be like that, huh?"
Paris,"I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter."
Andy,"In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed."
Jim,Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
Pam,"Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please."
Jim,"Okay, good. Stay right here."
Andy,"Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one."
Jim,Are there any messages?
Pam,Nope.
Jim,So weird.
Pam,Hmm.
Michael,Nice to have Oscar back.
Angela,Yeah.
Andy,Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
Jim,No.
Andy,Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Pam,Angela?
Angela,Oh.
Pam,Is everything okay?
Angela,No.
Andy,What's going on?
Jim,What are you talking about?
Andy,Where is my FREAKING phone?!
Jim,You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.
Andy,Maybe you're in the ceiling!
Jim,Okay.
Andy,"I don't trust you, Phyllis!"
Angela,"I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me."
Michael,Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Angela,Yes.
Michael,Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Angela,None of them. Especially not Andy.
Michael,"Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly."
Andy,Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
Michael,Um.
Andy,"Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own."
Michael,No. I don't want to do any of that.
Andy,Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
Michael,"No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy."
Andy,"Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD. That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?"
Pam,Yeah.
Andy,Sure? Okay.
Dwight,"Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you."
Michael,Hey.
Dwight,Hey.
Michael,What's up?
Dwight,Same old.
Michael,Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Dwight,"Oh my God, she told you?"
Michael,"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize."
Dwight,Accepted.
Michael,How's this place treating you?
Dwight,The boss isn't funny.
Michael,"Oh, well."
Dwight,I don't get to wear my ties.
Michael,No. I'm sure.
Dwight,So?
Michael,"So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please."
Dwight,I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Michael,We can talk about that. All right.
Jim,"Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall."
Pam,I think we broke his brain.
Jim,"""It's not freakin' funny!"""
Angela,Are you enjoying your fiesta?
Oscar,"Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- it's great."
Michael,Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Everybody,Yay.
Angela,Welcome back.
Dwight,Thank you.
Michael,"Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. Not bad, huh?"
Dwight,You did this for me?
Michael,Guilty.
Creed,Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
Meredith,Gerty's.
Creed,Which aisle?
Meredith,I don't remember.
Creed,"Well, draw me a map, mama."
Michael,Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
Pam,"No, I will not."
Michael,So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
Oscar,It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Michael,"Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much."
Jim,Hey.
Karen,Do you still have feelings for her?
Jim,Yes.
Michael,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?"
Dwight,"Oh, man. No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out!"
Michael,It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
Andy,"So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so."
Marcy,"Oh, hi. You must be Andy."
Andy,"Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!"
Marcy,"That's right, it's so good to meet you."
Andy,It's so good to meet you!
Marcy,"Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?"
Andy,Yeah.
Michael,"Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road---"
Elizabeth,"Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here."
Dwight,How do you know it's going to be a boy?
Pam,Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.
Michael,"How, would you stop interrupting please?"
Elizabeth,You could strip you know.
Michael,"Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life."
Pam,Thanks.
Michael,Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
Michael,So you don't want to end our relationship?
Michael,"To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever."
Jan,I'm closer to firing you.
Dwight,
Michael,That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?
Michael,"Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra."
Jan,I'll talk to you later.
Pam,What?
Michael,You are. You are.
Michael,We will demonstrate on Pam.
Michael,"So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't."
Pam,No. No.
Dwight,Are you near sighted or far sighted?
Michael,Come on.
Ben Franklin,Both. That's why I invented the bifocal.
Michael,You just twist your hand until something breaks.
Dwight,GAH!!!
Dwight,Ow.
Michael,Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.
Michael,"And remember no matter what, I will always love you."
Dwight,What if he's a murderer?
Michael,He's not going to be a murderer.
Dwight,Maybe that's how you die.
Michael,"You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?"
Dwight,I want to do this.
Michael,Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-
Dwight,Action.
Michael,"Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta."
Jim,"Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So..."
Michael,I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
Michael,"I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat."
Michael,What's up spinsters?
Angela,Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.
Michael,No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2
Karen,I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
Jim,"Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights."
Pam,"Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck."
Packer,"Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever. Hey everybody it's me, Jim. Hello, hello. Todd Packer."
Karen,Karen Fillipelli. Jim's girlfriend.
Packer,Shut up!
Karen,Yep.
Packer,Shut it!
Karen,That's rude.
Packer,Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
Michael,Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh!
Packer,What happened?
Michael,Oh God-
Packer,Quick somebody help! Help the man!
Michael,"No, no, no!"
Michael,"I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man."
Packer,I have a full day of sales calls.
Michael,You should get out of them.
Packer,
Michael,It's the only time he can do it. 2
Packer,And what kind of stripper did you get?
Michael,I did not order a stripper.
Packer,You didn't order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Michael,"Um, not personally, no."
Packer,"Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard."
Michael,I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.
Packer,"Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal."
Michael,So that's what that means.
Michael,"Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!"
Dwight,Alright! Uh!
Michael,Gay.
Dwight,What?
Michael,Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.
Angela,Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Meredith,SHUT UP ANGELA!
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,Ugh.
Jim,Ugh.
Pam,Everything okay?
Jim,Oh yeah. Why?
Pam,Well you seem a little tired.
Jim,"Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking."
Pam,You should get more sleep.
Jim,"Yeah, I know I should."
Pam,Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
Jim,"No, I'm sure you're right."
Pam,"When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference."
Jim,Really?
Pam,Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.
Jim,Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there.
Pam,Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk. Oh my God.
Michael,Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
Jim,Absolutely not.
Dwight,I'm on it.
Michael,Well get on it. And make it happen.
Dwight,"Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-"
Jim,Stop. That's disgusting.
Dwight,Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
Jim,Fine.
Dwight,"I knew you would, Nancy."
Jim,Sally.
Dwight,"No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?"
Jim,Blonde.
Dwight,Nice. Do you have any blonde women?
Michael,
Ryan,He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling.
Michael,"Gotcha, oh! Yes?"
Jim,Are you okay?
Michael,"I'm in the, I'm in the s*x shop."
Jim,"Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants."
Michael,Squarepants?
Jim,"Yep, Spongebob Squarepants."
Michael,And you think that'd be sexy?
Jim,"Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania."
Ben Franklin,Hold the door please!
Michael,Oh.
Ben Franklin,Thank you.
Michael,Oh. Hello!
Ben Franklin,Hello!
Michael,You wearing a thong?
Ben Franklin,What?
Angela,Sparkling cider is very good.
Pam,I think that's champagne.
Angela,
Michael,"Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin."
Ben Franklin,"Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin."
Michael,"Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?"
Ben Franklin,"Knickers in fact, yes!"
Michael,"He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever."
Ben Franklin,"Well, actually, I never was president."
Michael,"Yes, but, Ben Franklin was."
Ben Franklin,Ah. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers.
Michael,And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.
Meredith,"Wait, this is the entertainment?"
Michael,"Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one."
Jim,Have you ever seen a stripper before?
Dwight,Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.
Jim,"Yeah, me neither."
Elizabeth,Hey.
Jim,Hi.
Elizabeth,"I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested."
Dwight,"Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper."
Elizabeth,I'm the stripper.
Dwight,"Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such."
Jim,Oh God.
Dwight,"Is she hot? Text back, ""Kind of."""
Ben Franklin,"It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight."
Karen,Mr. Franklin?
Ben Franklin,Yes?
Karen,Do you have a girlfriend?
Ben Franklin,"I have a lovely wife, Deborah."
Pam,But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?
Ben Franklin,"Uh, well that is a grey area of my life. Okay? So, it was a warm June evening."
Michael,Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
Ryan,Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
Michael,No. Yes.
Ryan,Oh gross.
Michael,But I got all the foot off of it.
Pam,Okay Ben Franklin!
Karen,Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Ben Franklin,"Well, that is because I am a renaissance man."
Pam,"Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?"
Ben Franklin,"Well, you're very saucy!"
Michael,"Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?"
Dwight,I do! I want some man meat!
Jim,"Michael, Dwight would like your man meat."
Michael,"Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity."
Stanley,Of course.
Karen,"So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?"
Pam,Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
Karen,"Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys."
Pam,What do you mean?
Karen,"Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him?"
Pam,Oh yeah.
Karen,Really?
Pam,"Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together."
Karen,Okay.
Pam,I'm not into Jim. Yeah.
Karen,"So um, well good."
Pam,Yeah. Sorry.
Karen,What are you sorry about?
Pam,"Um, what?"
Karen,What are you sorry about?
Pam,Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.
Kevin,"Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild."
Michael,I call shuffle. Here we go.
Kevin,Michael.
Michael,"Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth."
Elizabeth,Hi guys!
Michael,Nice outfit.
Elizabeth,I hear there's an important meeting here.
Roy,I'm not really into strippers. You know what I find sexy? Pam's art. She's an artist and I appreciate that. It's very moving and sexy. The art.
Elizabeth,Hit it. So where's the groom?
Michael,He's right there. There he is.
Bob Vance,Absolutely not. That's all you. That's all you.
Michael,"Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I?"
Elizabeth,Just sit on down.
Michael,Alright.
Elizabeth,Alright.
Michael,Okay.
Elizabeth,Here we go.
Michael,Here we go. Alright!
Elizabeth,Yeah!
Michael,Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.
Elizabeth,"Mmm, what's that?"
Michael,You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...
Elizabeth,I bet she'd be jealous.
Michael,"Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!"
Dwight,"Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it."
Elizabeth,You want me to answer phones with my clothes on.
Dwight,We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Elizabeth,Oh I love your poster.
Angela,Thank you.
Kevin,
Ben Franklin,You know I invented electricity.
Pam,I know.
Ben Franklin,Well I'm sensing a little electricity right here.
Pam,Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?
Ben Franklin,"Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon."
Pam,Ohhh.
Michael,On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
Ben Franklin,"You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son."
Michael,Really.
Ben Franklin,But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler s*x.
Michael,"Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag."
Michael,"Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?"
Elizabeth,"Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone."
Michael,Wow. Thank you.
Dwight,Care for a piece of chocolate?
Ben Franklin,Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States.
Dwight,Who is the king of Austria?
Ben Franklin,Joseph the 2nd.
Dwight,Who is the king of Prussia?
Ben Franklin,Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd.
Dwight,Who is the king of England?
Ben Franklin,"Why the tyrant King George, of course!"
Dwight,"I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure."
Jan,"Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay?"
Michael,"Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will."
Jan,Okay.
Michael,I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
Jan,"Uh when, when did, when last night?"
Michael,"No, today at work."
Jan,You went to a bachelor party at work?
Michael,Yes. I kind of arranged it.
Kelly,Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot?
Ryan,Kelly don't do this.
Kelly,Do what? I just asked you a question.
Ryan,You know what you're doing.
Kelly,"Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam."
Jim,Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley?
Pam,"Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever."
Ryan,Ok.
Jim,"Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?"
Dwight,What do you think?
Jim,"In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment."
Jim,"Dwight, want an Altoid?"
Dwight,Okay.
Jim,Altoid?
Dwight,Sure
Jim,Mint Dwight?
Dwight,Inbwit? Yes.
Dwight,
Jim,What are you doing?
Dwight,I...
Jim,What?
Dwight,I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
Michael,"Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?"
Photographer,"Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great."
Michael,"Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride."
Phyllis,"Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before."
Pam,"Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'."
Jim,So what's in the box?
Stanley,"A toaster, you?"
Karen,A toaster.
Stanley,Unbelievable.
Dwight,"Hello, Angela."
Angela,"Hi, Dwight."
Dwight,You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Angela,Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
Dwight,"The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair."
Jim,Those flowers are nice.
Karen,Yeah. P and R?
Jim,Phyllis and Robert.
Karen,"Ah, of course."
Pam,"Also, Pam and Roy."
Michael,There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
Phyllis,"Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside."
Michael,How you doin'? You excited.
Phyllis,"Yes, very."
Michael,"Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?"
Phyllis,No.
Michael,"You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous..."
Phyllis,That wasn't me.
Michael,Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
Phyllis,I thought it was...
Michael,"Here, let me..."
Phyllis,Michael... No.
Michael,Just cover up that bald patch.
Phyllis,"I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
Michael,I hate you!
Michael,Long story short
Dwight,Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
Jim,You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
Dwight,No way.
Jim,Did you ever see that movie?
Dwight,Of course I saw it.
Dwight,"I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it."
Jim,"You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out."
Dwight,"Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift."
Kevin,Hi. I'm Kevin. Where did you find her?
Toby,At the gym.
Kevin,Riiight. The gym.
Kelly,Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
Meredith,I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Kelly,I know but there was an emergency.
Kelly,I look really good in white.
Michael,"This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it."
Pam,That's my dress.
Michael,That's ok.
Dwight,It's a miracle.
Crowd,
Michael,This is bull****!
Michael,Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
Michael,"I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over."
Priest,"And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Phyllis,I do.
Michael,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!"
Priest,"And do you, Bob..."
Michael,"Oh, shiii..."
Priest,... take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife
Bob Vance,I do.
Priest,You may now kiss the bride.
Michael,"Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!"
Angela,"Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning."
Phyllis,Thanks Angela.
Michael,"Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you."
Bob Vance,"If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you."
Michael,"Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too."
Dwight,"Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers."
Phyllis,"I don't have that, Dwight."
Dwight,"Dammit, Phyllis!"
Kelly,Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
Pam,What do you mean?
Kelly,Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
Pam,Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine
Kelly,"There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant."
Pam,"Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks"
Dwight,"'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?"
Uncle Al,Who?
Dwight,The bride and groom? What are their names?
Uncle Al,"Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure."
Dwight,"Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on."
Uncle Al,"Okay, Okay. Where are we going?"
Dwight,"Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend."
Uncle Al,Oh!
Michael,Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
Phyllis,It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Michael,I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
Phyllis,It's fish.
Michael,I will take care of that.
Michael,I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
Kevin,No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Kevin,"Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light."
Roy,Hey.
Pam,Hey.
Roy,"I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste."
Pam,"You're kidding me, right?"
Roy,"I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom."
Pam,"Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding."
Roy,I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
Pam,Yeah.
Roy,Sorry about that.
Pam,It's okay.
Roy,You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
Randy,"Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler!"
Crowd,
Unknown,She is.
Randy,Cheers.
Crowd,Cheers.
Michael,"Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines ""wedding"" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride ""Mawige..."
Michael,"The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones."
Michael,Phyllis and Bob
Bob Vance,Oh okay. That's enough.
Michael,is a guy that...
Bob Vance,"Thanks, Michael. Give me..."
Michael,"he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay."
Bob Vance,Give me the microphone.
Michael,No. I'm not going to...
Bob Vance,"Give me... Give me the microphone, Michael."
Michael,Ok. All right.
Bob Vance,You're out of here!
Michael,Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
Jim,Hey.
Pam,Hey!
Jim,When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
Pam,Oh... I'm pacing myself.
Jim,Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
Pam,No. I'm such a dorky dancer.
Jim,I know. It's very cute.
Jim,"Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical."
Michael,Come... Come on!
Dwight,"I can't let you in, Michael."
Michael,"Dwight, just..."
Dwight,"No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders."
Michael,"Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song."
Dwight,"You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure."
Michael,OK.
Roy,"Hey, they're playing our song."
Pam,"Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police."
Roy,I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
Michael,ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
Roy,"Hey, want to get out of here?"
Jim,Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
Karen,Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Women,One... Two... Three. Ahhhh!
Toby,Toby! Yeah!
Michael,I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
Uncle Al,Phyllis and you will be great together.
Michael,We are great together. We are a great team.
Uncle Al,The Celtics were a great team.
Michael,Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
Uncle Al,Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know!
Michael,"Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head."
Michael,Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
Phyllis,You found Uncle Al!
Michael,Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
Phyllis,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael,You're... You're welcome.
Michael,They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
Michael,Be careful. Oh no!! Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!
Michael,"Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?"
Kevin,"My tire blew out on the way here, Michael."
Michael,Huh?
Kevin,I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Michael,Pop quiz.
Kevin,...What?
Michael,Why is today a special day?
Kevin,I almost died.
Michael,"Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you..."
Ryan,You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Michael,"In business school, Kevin. Business school."
Kevin,Wow.
Ryan,"If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right?"
Michael,"A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us."
Michael,Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
Dwight,"""Don't be an idiot."" Changed my life."
Dwight,"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, ""Would an idiot do that?"" And if they would, I do not do that thing."
Michael,"Will they throw their hats, you think?"
Ryan,What?
Michael,"A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air."
Ryan,Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
Michael,"Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that"
Ryan,...It doesn't apply.
Michael,"I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! Whoa, hey!"
Ryan,Quit it!
Michael,We have fun.
Roy,I can't for your art show tonight.
Pam,"Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio."
Roy,I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Pam,Thanks.
Pam,I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Roy,Love ya.
Pam,You too.
Jim,"Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on."
Kelly,I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Pam,"Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know."
Kelly,Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Pam,"Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way."
Kelly,"Oh, art show!"
Pam,"I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there."
Kelly,...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
Michael,Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? Whoo!
College Student,....Dude.
Dwight,...Oh my God. Animal stool.
Pam,"Dwight, what are you doing?"
Dwight,"Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!"
Karen,Oh my God!
Dwight,BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Stanley,Goooood bye.
Angela,... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Michael,"Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now."
Ryan,"...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off..."
Michael,"I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it."
Dwight,We have... a bat... in the office.
Toby,The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Angela,Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Jim,Okay. Thanks. Animal control will be here at six.
Dwight,"At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership."
Jim,I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Dwight,What? What's so wierd?
Jim,"The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... Oh well."
Ryan,"And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott."
Michael,"Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business"
Dwight,"This is your job, Halpert."
Jim,Ow!
Karen,"Oh, what happened?"
Jim,That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Karen,"But Jim, this garlic bread is cold."
Jim,What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Dwight,No... no. One crisis at a time.
Dwight,"If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a ""sylvania."" Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ."
Michael,"So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... a Whatchamacallit. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand. Satisfied?"
Toby,"Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it."
Pam,"Oh! No, you should go."
Toby,"Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art."
Michael,"Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies."
Ryan,Michael.
Michael,...And products!
Ryan,What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Michael,"Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up."
Business Student #1,"Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?"
Michael,"We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down."
Karen,"Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted."
Jim,"Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare."
Karen,What glare?
Jim,The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
Dwight,"I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog."
Dwight,Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Creed,Sure.
Dwight,#NAME?
Creed,Okay.
Dwight,Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Creed,What size?
Business Student #2,What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
Michael,"...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back."
Business Student #2,Has anyone ever come back?
Michael,"...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid."
Business Student #3,How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
Michael,"Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?"
Business Student #3,...What?
Michael,"Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?"
Business Student #1,By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
Michael,"...Wait, Ryan said that?"
Kelly,What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Creed,Animals can't feel pain.
Kelly,"Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!"
Dwight,Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Kelly,AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Kevin,I... am a hero!
Michael,"Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay."
Business Student #2,But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
Michael,David will always beat Goliath.
Business Student #1,"But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax..."
Michael,"Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?"
Business Student #1,But in the big picture...
Michael,"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. SO SUCK ON THAT!"
Ryan,...It wasn't personal.
Michael,"Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things."
Ryan,Pack my--?
Michael,"You heard me, pack your things."
Meredith,I really want to come out!
Creed,"Good night, Mary Beth!"
Jim,So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Dwight,Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Jim,"Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight."
Dwight,Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Dwight,"Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen."
Pam,...And it's all from the same series.
Woman,Oh.
Pam,Called 'Impressions.'
Woman,Oh.
Pam,"Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se."
Woman,Maybe one day.
Pam,I hope so.
Woman,Mmm.
Pam,"I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. Hey, babe, how are you?"
Roy,"Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?"
Pam,"Hey, Kenny."
Kenny,Hey Pam.
Roy,"How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?"
Dwight,Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!
Meredith,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Dwight,"Hold still, woman!"
Meredith,Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Dwight,... ... You're welcome.
Roy,"It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them."
Pam,"Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home."
Roy,To my place?
Pam,"Maybe, I'm a little tired."
Roy,Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Pam,Thank you.
Ryan,"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me."
Michael,"Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex."
Ryan,To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Michael,"A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business."
Oscar,You're the one who said we needed more culture.
Gil,This is culture to you?
Oscar,It's her first try.
Gil,"Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants."
Oscar,Meaning what?
Gil,"Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty."
Oscar,"Well, those aren't Pam's strong points."
Gil,"Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art."
Artist,Thanks for coming.
Michael,"Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town."
Pam,"Oh, Michael."
Michael,Wow! You did these... freehand?
Pam,Yep.
Michael,"My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. ... How much?"
Pam,What do you mean?
Michael,I don't see a... price.
Pam,Um... you wanna buy it?
Michael,"Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?"
Pam,Uh-huh.
Michael,That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Pam,... Thank you.
Michael,What?
Pam,Do you have something in your pocket?
Michael,...Chunky. Do you want half?
Pam,No thank you.
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera."
Kelly,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God..."
Ryan,"It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited."
Kelly,"I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't..."
Michael,Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,Yes. But this seems to be...
Karen,Hey Jan.
Michael,"And now, the chains."
Jan,Not too good.
Michael,"A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school."
Rachel,Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad?
Michael,"MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. Can he do it? I don't see how he can."
Michael,Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
Dwight,I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
David,"What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?"
Michael,"No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!"
Jim,I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Jim,"Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?"
Dwight,"The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party."
Michael,"I will get out. Oh yes, I will."
Roy,What?
Pam,"So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?"
Pam,I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Michael,"No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go."
Roy,That's awesome. That's what I want.
Michael,AHHHH!
Pam,"Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us."
Kevin,"Is everything ok, Michael?"
Roy,"I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all."
Michael,Yes.
Pam,Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
Michael,"I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key..."
Roy,What?
Michael,Alright.
Pam,"He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed."
Dwight,
Roy,Jim came on to you?
Michael,Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Pam,Just listen.
Jim,"Another worm? Like, are they friends?"
Roy,"No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!"
Dwight,It's early bird gets the worm.
Pam,Don't yell!
Michael,"Pam, would you smell my breath?"
Roy,Don't yell?!
Pam,"No, no."
Pam,This is over.
Dwight,"Let me smell. Good, not great."
Roy,"Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!"
Michael,"""Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?"" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special."
Kenny,Damn jet skis!
Michael,"Jimbo, last chance to carpool."
Michael,"Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle..."
Jim,"Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car."
Jan,I feel sick.
Michael,Sure? Might be a good idea.
Michael,You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Jim,Yeah.
Jan,"No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public."
Michael,"Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip."
Michael,"Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly."
Jim,Thanks.
Jan,Please don't cry.
Michael,Play some games?
Michael,I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
Jim,Oh. Um. I think we're good.
Jan,"It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him."
Michael,I spy?
Michael,"I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling."
Jim,Yeah.
Jan,I didn't mean it. I was...
Jim,"Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?"
Michael,Whatever.
Dwight,Thanks for inviting me along.
Jan,"Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it."
Michael,"Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Heh-woh you."
Michael,"That's all, you didn't mean it?"
Jan,Michael?
Jan,That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Michael,"Hey, Buttercup."
Michael,"I love you, Jan."
Jan,Hi.
Jan,Ok.
Michael,I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
Dwight,"Don't break up you guys, you're great together."
Jan,Let's just blow this party off.
Roy,Are they going to call the cops?
Michael,That's what she said.
Kenny,"No, I paid them off."
Jan,Am I on speaker phone?
Roy,Jet ski money?
Michael,"Uh, yes you are."
Kenny,All of it.
Jan,Is anybody else in the...
Roy,I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
Dwight,"Hello, Jan."
Jan,"Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone."
Michael,No problem.
Jan,Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
Michael,Ok.
Jan,...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Michael,"Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I..."
Jan,Still on speaker?
Michael,Ummm... I don't know.
Jan,Are camera's there?
Michael,Maybe.
Jan,See you soon.
Michael,Ok.
Dwight,"Talk to you later, Jan."
Michael,Alright. Bye.
Pam,"Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come."
Roy,"I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered."
Pam,"Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things."
Roy,Ok.
Pam,"I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy."
Michael,Beauty. Thank you sir!
Dwight,Salad.
Michael,Thank you.
Dwight,You dressed exactly like the servants.
Michael,"Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me."
Dwight,Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Michael,"I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that."
Dwight,That would have been really embarrassing.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,Crisis averted.
Michael,Ok.
Pam,"Oh, that duck is so cute."
Kevin,Hey Pam.
Pam,Hey guys.
Kevin,Oscar. Angela.
Michael,Hi.
Michael,"Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend."
Michael,"Oh, um, potato salad."
Dwight,It's from both of us.
Michael,"No, it's not."
Rachel,"Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok."
Michael,"Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here."
Michael,"It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know."
Pam,"Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?"
Kevin,Yeah.
Kelly,"Oh my God, when is it?"
Kevin,It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
Roy,Hey.
Pam,Hey. You made it.
Roy,"You said it was important, so... How's it going?"
Kenny,"What's up, Pam."
Pam,"Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis."
Roy,"You guys, uh, want a round, on me?"
Everyone,Yeah.
Roy,Yeah? Get you a drink.
Kenny,Thanks man.
Angela,"No thank you, Roy."
Dwight,"Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces."
Michael,What are you looking for? You bring dip?
Jan,"I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR."
Michael,Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
Jan,You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Michael,Over our love.
Jan,I've never told you that I love you.
Michael,"You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all."
Jan,"I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star."
Jan,"What's this over the ""i""?"
Michael,It's a heart.
Jan,Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Michael,I love this woman!
Jan,"Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please."
Dwight,Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
Dan Gore,No.
Dwight,No? Then you are an idiot.
Rachel,Hello Michael.
Michael,"Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So..."
David,"Jan, glad you could make it."
Jan,"Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?"
David,Of course I do.
Jan,From the Scranton Branch.
Michael,Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Jan,"David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please."
Rachel,Excuse me.
Michael,Ok.
Pam,"Oh. No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite."
Bartender,"Oh, sorry."
Man,"So did the merger go smoothly, or?"
Michael,"It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them."
Karen,I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Michael,"Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?"
Jan,"We're good. Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?"
Rachel,"Can I get anyone anything, or?"
Michael,I could go for an appeteaser.
Jan,Martini please.
Michael,Bagel bites or something.
Karen,"Rachel, your house is beautiful."
Rachel,Thank you.
Dwight,What's the square footage?
David,"About 5,000."
Dwight,Does that include the garage?
Michael,"Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate."
Dwight,I'm just...
David,I don't know
Dwight,It's a common question.
Michael,"David, how much did this house cost?"
Dwight,"These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around."
Rachel,I'll show you around.
Dwight,"Cool, let's start with the banisters."
Karen,"Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?"
Jim,Yep.
Karen,"That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date."
Jim,"Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me."
Karen,And it didn't end well.
Jim,Gotcha. Alright.
David,"This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch."
Michael,"Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean."
Jan,You ok?
Michael,Yeah. Do you have any ice?
David,Sure.
Michael,How about some Splenda?
Roy,"One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here."
Kenny,Where?
Roy,On this side.
Kevin,"No, it is definitely under one of these hands."
Ryan,I think I heard it on Roy's side.
Kevin,"No, it is here."
Ryan,Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
Kevin,Good thing you didn't listen to me.
Ryan,"Yeah, close one."
Roy,Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. Not here..
Kenny,YES!
Pam,Nice job.
Roy,I can read you like a book.
Pam,Oh yeah?
Roy,You can't keep anything from me.
Student 1,Hey Creed.
Creed,Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Student 2,You're the man buddy.
Creed,I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
Dwight,"Huh. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here?."
Rachel,"Uh, that's a guest room."
Dwight,Just the one window?
Rachel,Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.
Dwight,Are those real pearls?
Rachel,"Uh, yes."
Dwight,Good.
Jim,"Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care."
Karen,"Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated."
Jim,Oh. Hadn't noticed.
Karen,Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Jim,"No, it was before I knew you so, its fine."
Michael,This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
Jan,It's nice.
Michael,You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
Jan,"I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family."
Michael,"Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo."
Jim,Oh.
Michael,Crazy.
Jan,I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Michael,Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
Jan,"Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just."
Michael,What are you doing?
Jan,Don't you know what I'm doing?
Michael,"Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy."
Jan,Shut up.
Michael,What has gotten into you?
Jan,Come on.
Michael,"No, no, no."
Jan,What?
Michael,"Come on, let's go back to the party."
Jan,Just let me loosen my dress.
Michael,"Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan."
Jan,Michael.
Michael,"No, no, no, means please don't. Please."
Jan,"Slam me up against the wall, right here."
Michael,I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
Jan,"Oh, please."
Michael,You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
Jan,"Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out."
Toby,Here.
Pam,"Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you."
Toby,I was...
Pam,"Hey, don't you have a daughter?"
Toby,Yes.
Dwight,"Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?"
Child,"I don't know, it was here when I was born."
Dwight,I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
Child,I don't know.
Dwight,What do you know?
David,"God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes."
Jim,"You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace."
Karen,"Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me."
Jim,"Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? Wow. Ok. You got me."
Karen,I so got you.
Jim,"So, none of them?"
Karen,"Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first."
Jim,Really?
Karen,"Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun."
Karen,So do you want to see it or not?
Jan,"Michael, he's your branch's HR rep..."
Jim,I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Michael,"No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known."
Karen,"Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic."
Jan,"...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it."
Jim,Agoraphobic?
Michael,Fine.
Karen,Yeah.
Kelly,You are so mean.
Jim,Really?
Ryan,I don't know what you're talking about.
Karen,"Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend."
Kelly,"Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid."
Jim,Absolutely correct.
Ryan,"No, I said your idea was stupid."
Kevin,"Later, Jim."
Michael,"Toby, come on. Let's go."
Jim,"Kev, have a good weekend."
Toby,Where?
Karen,"Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up."
Michael,"Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go."
Jim,Here we go...
Kelly,What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Karen,...and we're gonna go to dinner.
Toby,Alright.
Jim,Ok...
Kelly,Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
Karen,And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Ryan,Don't you see why that's insane?
Jim,Sounds good.
Kelly,"Oh, so I'm crazy now?"
Roy,Hey Halpert!
Darryl,"Comfortable, Mike?"
Jim,Hey...
Michael,Yeah. Fine.
Pam,ROY!
Darryl,"How about you, man. Comfortable?"
Karen,
Toby,No.
Pam,Roy don't!
Michael,"Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way."
Roy,Ahh God!
Darryl,Thank you.
Dwight,"Pam, please call security!"
Michael,Well...
Dwight,"Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?"
Darryl,I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Michael,"No need for consternation, everything is under control."
Michael,"Mm, the Big Apple."
Jan,"Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!"
Darryl,Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there.
Michael,"It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled."
Toby,How would we get home?
Jan,Is Toby there?
Darryl,Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.
Michael,No...
Michael,Maybe I'll stay.
Toby,"I'm... here, Jan."
Darryl,"Mm, it's not that big."
Jan,"Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?"
Michael,Well...
Toby,"Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company."
Darryl,"Busses, though. They get you home quick."
Jan,Thank God.
Michael,"Oh, I..."
Toby,"Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his..."
Kelly,"And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like ""No!"""
Michael,"No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage."
Angela,Then what'd he do?
Jan,"All right, well are you gonna take care of this?"
Kelly,"You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams..."
Michael,Yeppers.
Hunter,"Hey guys, Jan is ready for you."
Jan,"What did I tell you about ""yeppers?"""
Darryl,"Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you."
Michael,I don't... remember.
Michael,"Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity."
Jan,I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?
Darryl,Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me
Michael,Yeesh...
Michael,All right.
Pam,"I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked."
Darryl,"Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself."
Jim,"I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars."
Roy,"Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. Thanks. Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?"
Jim,"Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you."
Pam,I don't know.
Dwight,"Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded."
Roy,Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you.
Jim,Okay. Um... Got you something.
Kevin,Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Dwight,Don't want it.
Jim,"Thanks, Kev. I'm good though."
Jim,You don't know what it is.
Jan,"Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Ah, Okay."
Dwight,Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
Michael,Who's the boy toy?
Jim,"It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven."
Jan,That's my new assistant.
Dwight,"No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes."
Michael,Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Oscar,"Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up."
Jan,I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Kevin,"Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight."
Michael,"Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers."
Oscar,It was crazy.
Toby,"Hi, Jan."
Angela,You saw it? Describe it please.
Jan,"Hi, Toby. First--- First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear?"
Oscar,"Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero."
Michael,Pippity poppity.
Angela,Oh...
Jan,Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Oscar,It was insane!
Michael,Six percent? After all we've been through?
Angela,Well... good for Dwight.
Jan,"Oh, God."
Michael,"Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you."
Michael,I got you... jade earrings.
Jim,Where'd you get that?
Jan,Michael---
Michael,Wikipedia.
Michael,No!
Michael,"Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information."
Jan,Michael---
Michael,"Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise."
Michael,"No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x. What are you writing, perv-ball?"
Jim,"Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise."
Toby,Just preparing for the deposition.
Michael,"Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... that maybe you should..."
Toby,This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold s*x from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
Jim,I can't hear you.
Roy,"I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong."
Michael,"What I'm saying is that,"
Pam,"I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices."
Jim,Still nothin'.
Roy,So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Michael,"Ok, see what I did?"
Pam,"Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend."
Jim,No.
Roy,"Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy."
Michael,"By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position."
Pam,"No, there were a lot of reasons."
Jim,Nice.
Roy,But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? I don't get you Pam.
Michael,"Ok, let's try another one. Um..."
Pam,I know.
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,What's this?
Michael,Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
Jim,What's what?
Jim,And what happens in this one?
Dwight,"Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. ""Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute"""
Michael,It's a surprise.
Jim,Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor.
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Michael,"Go ahead, ask me for a raise."
Jim,Didn't think you'd notice...
Jim,Can I have a raise?
Michael,"Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!"
Michael,
Jan,"Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere."
Jim,"s*x, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher."
Michael,"Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere."
Michael,What?
Jan,"Ok, Toby, how about if you..."
Jim,What?
Toby,Sure.
Michael,"No, what did you say?"
Jan,Great.
Jim,I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.
Jan,What's wrong with you?
Michael,Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
Michael,"Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---"
Dwight,"I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place."
Jan,"Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15."
Toby,Which is where?
Michael,Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Dwight,"Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end."
Jan,"No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay?"
Toby,Thanks Dwight.
Michael,"Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise."
Kelly,That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Jan,No. But we can offer you 12.
Ryan,I can't imagine what I would have done.
Michael,But you just said 15.
Kelly,I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Michael,"Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--"
Ryan,"Well that was funny, that's why."
Jan,Michael!
Kelly,Oh it was?
Stanley,So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Ryan,Mm-hmm.
Phyllis,"Mm-hmm, near the river."
Kelly,"Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night..."
Stanley,"Mm, how many bedrooms?"
Ryan,Okay.
Phyllis,Four.
Kelly,"...and you call me, to calm you down..."
Angela,Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Ryan,You know what? I didn't---
Dwight,Really?
Toby,Can you stop...
Angela,Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.
Kelly,"...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not."
Dwight,"Mm, good stuff."
Toby,"There's a bunch of people back here, maybe..."
Angela,"Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together."
Ryan,"Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night..."
Dwight,Sounds... fun.
Toby,Guys...
Jim,"I... will never say a word. And now, we are even."
Kelly,I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
Andy,"I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it. So look out Dunder Mifflin! I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you..."
Toby,"I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius."
Andy,"Hey guys! Guess who's back! AHHH! OH, GOD!"
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,No need to thank me.
Darryl,You ready for me?
Dwight,"I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono."
Michael,"Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat."
Darryl,Cool.
Michael,"You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room."
Darryl,Okay.
Michael,"No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room."
Michael,Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.
Michael,"Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control."
Michael,I am declining to speak first.
Darryl,"Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now."
Michael,"Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now."
Darryl,Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Michael,What?
Darryl,Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants.
Michael,"No, this is a power suit."
Darryl,That there's a woman's suit.
Michael,I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.
Darryl,"I'ma call Roy, man."
Michael,Ohh... kay.
Darryl,This is gonna make him feel better.
Michael,All right.
Darryl,This is too good.
Michael,"Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?"
Pam,"Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!"
Kevin,You're wearing a woman's suit?
Michael,"No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin."
Michael,"There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual."
Kevin,Who makes it?
Michael,"Uh, MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery."
Phyllis,"Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?"
Michael,Okay.
Phyllis,Did you see...
Michael,"Would you stop it, please?"
Jim,"So, none of that tipped you off?"
Michael,"It's European, OK? It's a European cut."
Pam,"Michael, the pants don't have any pockets."
Michael,"No, they don't. See?"
Pam,
Michael,Italians don't wear pockets.
Pam,It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Karen,"Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?"
Michael,"No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway."
Darryl,"Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton."
Michael,"Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes."
Darryl,"Okay, can you just stand right there? I gotta send some e-mails."
Michael,"Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes."
Kevin,"Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?"
Karen,"I feel great, Kevin. Thank you."
Stanley,You must have been scared out of your mind.
Karen,"Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared."
Angela,"What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story."
Karen,"Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry."
Angela,Mm-hmm.
Karen,"And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt."
Angela,Goodness.
Karen,"When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more."
Michael,Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
Darryl,"Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise."
Michael,
Darryl,What? I can't hear you.
Michael,That was a very good point.
Darryl,"I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---"
Michael,You make a very compelling argument.
Pam,Sorry I almost got you killed.
Jim,"Yeah, that was nuts."
Pam,"He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?"
Jim,"No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection."
Pam,"Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now."
Jim,We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Pam,Jim... I am really... sorry.
Jim,"Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it."
Michael,"I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me."
Darryl,Why can't I just... tell you?
Michael,"Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. No, slide--- slide it, yes."
Darryl,There you go.
Michael,Oh. Come on. Be serious.
Darryl,"I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want."
Michael,"I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much."
Darryl,"Come on, be for real Mike."
Michael,I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.
Darryl,Are you serious? You're earning this?
Michael,"Plus perks, yes."
Darryl,"Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog."
Michael,Fourteen years.
Darryl,Ho-ho!
Michael,"No, please, please..."
Darryl,"Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. Ah."
Michael,"Ok, let's take 15, again."
Michael,"A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that."
Jim,"Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something."
Dwight,"When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?"
Jim,Boy I---
Dwight,"No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?"
Jim,"It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating."
Karen,Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Jim,"Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?"
Karen,Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Kevin,"Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you."
Michael,"Oh, thank you."
Kevin,Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...
Creed,Here's the $40 you gave me.
Michael,I didn't give you $40.
Creed,In a way you did.
Stanley,"Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid."
Darryl,"Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later."
Michael,"Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia."
Darryl,What?
Michael,"I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise."
Darryl,"That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss."
Michael,Well what am I supposed to do?
Darryl,"Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son."
Michael,I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.
Darryl,"Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have."
Michael,That's true.
Darryl,"Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship."
Michael,You know what? I should.
Darryl,"Yeah, you should."
Michael,I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Darryl,Fourteen years long.
Michael,You know what? I deserve a bump.
Darryl,"Make it happen, cap'in."
Michael,"I am makin' it happen, sergeant."
Creed,"I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11"
Angela,You're useless.
Jan,"Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?"
Michael,"No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today."
Jan,"Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?"
Michael,"Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away."
Jan,"Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present."
Michael,"Yes, I'm bringing Darryl."
Jan,Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
Michael,Mm-hm.
Jan,"No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby."
Michael,"Hey, I'd rather kill myself."
Andy,"Good morning, Pam."
Jim,"I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?"
Pam,"Oh, welcome back, Andy."
Kevin,"Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds."
Andy,Drew. I'm Drew now.
Kevin,"If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude."
Pam,Oh. Drew. Sorry.
Dwight,Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Andy,Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place.
Michael,"Oooooh, my life!"
Andy,"Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies."
Dwight,Michael! What's wrong?
Andy,Mornin' Jim.
Michael,"Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed."
Jim,"Hey, Andy. How are you, man?"
Dwight,Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Andy,Good. Drew.
Michael,"Dwight, you ignorant slut."
Jim,What's that?
Jim,"Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee."
Andy,Dr--- You can call me Drew.
Michael,"And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!"
Jim,"No, I'm not gonna call you that."
Jim,"Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part."
Andy,Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do.
Angela,This is just offensive.
Jim,Andy.
Ryan,At least we're outside.
Andy,Drew. Dwight. How's it goin' man?
Creed,"Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there."
Dwight,"Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna."
Jim,"Oh my God, there is a castle."
Dwight,"Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned."
Dwight,"No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael."
Jim,"Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug."
Michael,Damn it.
Dwight,"Ok, tell him that's not true."
Pam,"Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump."
Jim,Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
Jim,"Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself."
Andy,You guys...
Pam,Yeah...
Dwight,"Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!"
Jim,"Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured."
Jim,"Andy! Nah, that's too far."
Pam,"Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it."
Dwight,Damn you.
Michael,What is it?
Michael,"Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity."
Pam,Come down and... open it and you'll see.
Darryl,"Now, this is the forklift. You need--- You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. ... Quiz! Mike."
Michael,"Dwight, find out what the present is."
Michael,Hmm.
Dwight,"Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing."
Darryl,Should you drive the forklift?
Jim,Dwight...
Michael,"I can, and I have."
Pam,"Dwight, what are you---"
Darryl,"No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?"
Dwight,"Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan."
Lonny,You're not allowed to drive the forklift.
Michael,"Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?"
Darryl,"It's not safe, you don't have a license."
Darryl,"Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself."
Michael,"Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. Pudge has driven the forklift."
Michael,"You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life."
Madge,Madge.
Darryl,"Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for."
Michael,I thought your name was Pudge?
Michael,What do I have to live for?
Madge,"No, it's always been Madge."
Darryl,"A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right?"
Michael,"Okay. Um, her."
Michael,"It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The s*x isn't nearly as good as it used to be."
Darryl,"Her. Yes, ""her"" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?"
Darryl,"Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you."
Michael,"Ah, fine."
Michael,Do you really mean that?
Darryl,Do you understand that?
Darryl,I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave.
Michael,Yeeesh.
Michael,I'm braver than you?
Darryl,"We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled..."
Darryl,"Way braver! You Braveheart, man."
Michael,"""Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"""
Michael,I Braveheart. I am.
Darryl,And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Darryl,"Come down, okay?"
Darryl,The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Michael,"Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present."
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,"An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes."
Andy,It's on!
Darryl,How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Michael,Bail'er? I hardly know her.
Lonny,"Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man."
Darryl,Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody?
Kevin,Five bucks says it's over 50.
Jim,You really wanna bet?
Darryl,Anybody?
Kevin,"Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored."
Guy,How many?
Jim,"Ok, you're on."
Darryl,"Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?"
Kevin,Damn...
Darryl,"You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful..."
Jim,"No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'."
Kevin,On what?
Jim,"I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out."
Kevin,Nice.
Oscar,What are you guys talkin' about?
Darryl,"These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, Michael, should not go anywhere near them."
Michael,"Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody..."
Darry,It would be the worst thing in the world! It would! Very much so.
Lonny,What the hell is wrong with this man?
Michael,It's a big red trash compactor!
Lonny,What are you---
Darryl,It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!
Lonny,Don't disrespect the baler!
Michael,"Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions..."
Darryl,No do not touch it!
Michael,...would I go near---
Darryl,"There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?"
Michael,"Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!"
Toby,"Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour."
Michael,"Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and..."
Toby,"Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour."
Michael,"Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?"
Darryl,Take them at the same time.
Michael,"Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?"
Toby,"No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty."
Ryan,What about a long sleeve T?
Toby,"Well, that'll work."
Kevin,Long johns? A shaw?
Toby,"You know, anything that warms you."
Michael,"Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. Sorry, he is very lame. Um, let's see. ""Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."""
Darryl,Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Lonny,"Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?"
Michael,"Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation."
Darryl,"Actually, you did."
Michael,"Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. ""A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"""
Toby,Sedentary.
Michael,"Yes. ""Which can contribute to heart disease."" Heart disease kills more people that balers."
Lonny,"That's called having a fat butt, Michael."
Michael,"Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary..."
Lonny,"Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from?"
Michael,No.
Lonny,"Fat butt disease, Michael?"
Kelly,"Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds."
Lonny,"Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?"
Kelly,Ryan?
Lonny,"Dude, tell your girl to shut up."
Kelly,What?!
Ryan,"Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize."
Kelly,Are you kidding me?
Darryl,"Alright, we outta here."
Michael,"Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---"
Lonny,"Yeah, but ours was real, Michael."
Darryl,"That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it."
Michael,"Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?"
Michael,"Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... ""Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today."" ... This is one example."
Kevin,Ten.
Oscar,"Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant."
Jim,There's like ten green ones.
Oscar,Forty-two.
Jim,I'm gonna say fifty.
Karen,Fifty-one.
Jim,"Oh, don't be that person."
Kevin,That is lame.
Karen,It's a strategy!
Pam,It's called being smart.
Karen,Thank you.
Kevin,"Oh, geeze."
Pam,"I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun."
Pam,Ten...
Jim,Kev's out.
Kevin,Damn it.
Pam,"47, 48, 49! Jim wins!"
Everyone,Oooh!
Kevin,That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours.
Jim,"Okay, okay."
Kevin,"No, constantly. Like, for years."
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?"
Pam,I don't understand the question.
Michael,Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.
Pam,Yeah...
Michael,"I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that..."
Pam,It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.
Michael,"Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science."
Pam,"So, you're okay?"
Michael,Indubitably.
Michael,"They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes."
Dwight,"Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?"
Michael,"I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---"
Dwight,Wolves.
Michael,Nn--- Depression.
Dwight,Visual aids.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,A quilt. Depression quilt?
Micheal,No time to sew a quilt. ... I got it. Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
Michael,"You may be asking yourself, ""What am I doing on a trampoline?"" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, ""Hey! You ever seen a suicide?"" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note"
Kelly,"So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five,number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome. And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works?"
Ryan,I guess I forgot.
Kelly,You're such a ditz.
Kevin,"Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said ""awesome"" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies."
Dwight,"Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!"
Michael,"Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or..."
Dwight,We measured it once...
Michael,Go buy some watermelons.
Dwight,Seedless?
Michael,Just...
Toby,Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato.
Pam,Hey Creed.
Creed,Hey!
Pam,Hey.
Creed,Hello.
Pam,Yes!
Kevin,Here you go.
Toby,Nice.
Karen,I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out.
Dwight,Ready?
Michael,Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
Dwight,
Michael,BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,"Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes."
Dwight,Got it.
Michael,"Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler."
Dwight,We're not allowed to use the baler.
Michael,"Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster."
Dwight,I'm on it!
Dwight,I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
Andy,Thank you.
Dwight,It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.
Andy,Anything.
Dwight,"Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle."
Andy,You mean a moon bounce.
Dwight,What do you think? You've got an hour.
Andy,I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
Dwight,Shunning resumed.
Andy,"Do you, do you want a drawbridge?"
Dwight,Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.
Dwight,"Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision."
Michael,"Yes, thank you for seeing that."
Dwight,"When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults."
Michael,I don't know if I wanna do this.
Dwight,Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Michael,"No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking."
Dwight,That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!
Michael,Rock n' roll!
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,That's right! I am not thinking.
Dwight,Near near near near near!
Michael,Yes! Yeah!
Dwight,Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!
Michael,Woo!
Dwight,Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!
Michael,Woo!
Dwight,Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Michael,I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!
Dwight,"Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!"
Andy,Whoa! What's the situation?
Dwight,Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Andy,"Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?"
Dwight,Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Stanley,Is it nice outside?
Dwight,It's gorgeous. Let's go!
Stanley,Do I need my jacket?
Dwight,"No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!"
Ryan,Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Dwight,"Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!"
Dwight,"Come on, hurry up you guys!"
Michael,"My life! Oh, my life..."
Dwight,"Michael, what's wrong?!"
Michael,"Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression."
Dwight,Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael,"Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!"
Dwight,Is that the last year the data was available?
Michael,Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
Dwight,Don't do anything rash!
Michael,"Wait, where are the warehouse guys?"
Dwight,I didn't... I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Michael,Okay... that's...
Dwight,you said to just...
Michael,"That's the whole point, dummy."
Dwight,"Okay, I'm on it!"
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,Attention blue collar workers!
Pam,What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Jim,It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question. What kind of bear is best?
Dwight,Pam.
Dwight,That's a ridiculous question.
Pam,"Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today."
Jim,False. Black bear.
Dwight,Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
Dwight,Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---
Karen,"Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp."
Jim,Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
Dwight,"Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?"
Dwight,Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Jim,Do you?
Jim,"Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... eleven dollars."
Karen,No.
Dwight,"You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!"
Jim,OK.
Jim,... MICHAEL!
Karen,I'm good. Thanks.
Dwight,"Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!"
Jim,Look at that.
Pam,"Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?"
Dwight,I'm Jim Halpert.
Jim,Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Jim,Spot on.
Phyllis,"I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this."
Dwight,"Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh."
Stanley,I am upset. Don't I sound upset?
Michael,"It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper."
Michael,"We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan."
Michael,"Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime."
Dwight,Cri-Man-Squa?
Michael,Crisis Management Squad.
Ryan,"F and C, doubletime?"
Michael,Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?
Jim,One more. Why are you talking like that?
Michael,"To save time, Jim."
Karen,Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Pam,"Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time."
Michael,You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?
Creed,Here.
Michael,"Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy."
Creed,"Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens."
Michael,"We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today."
Oscar,That's really not our job.
Michael,"Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first."
Angela,Kelly's training us?
Kelly,This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This day is bananas! B-A-N-A-
Angela,I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing.
Michael,"Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids."
Jim,"Yeah, I gotta call out on that."
Michael,"No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person."
Jim,All right.
Michael,I want you to bring a partner.
Ryan,I'll go.
Michael,"No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go."
Andy,"William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do."
Jim,"Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone."
Michael,"No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference."
Dwight,"Yes! You are entering the ""No Spin Zone!"""
Pam,We're having a press conference?
Michael,"No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves."
Dwight,Not!
Michael,"Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J."
Michael,"I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story."
Jim,"Oh, did the press ask for a story?"
Michael,"Here is your headline. ""Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done."" Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!"
Creed,"Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect."
Creed,The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
Kelly,"Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause."
Oscar,I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Kelly,"I know, right? Probably a lot."
Angela,Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Kelly,"OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say ""Customer Service, this is Kelly!"" Except don't say ""Kelly,"" say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, and I talked like this for the whole conversation!"
Kevin,"Oh! Can I be Australian, mate?"
Kelly,Absolutely!
Kevin,"'ello, mate!"
Kelly,I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend.
Kevin,"I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies."
Andy,Beer me!
Jim,What's that?
Andy,"Hand me that water. I always say ""Beer me."" Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?"
Jim,You know her name.
Andy,"Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?"
Jim,It's fine.
Andy,"Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet."
Jim,What about music? Do you have any music?
Andy,"Uh, yeah. Should have said so. Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--"
Jim,"I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD."
Andy,"Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc."
Jim,"Lord, beer me strength."
Andy,"So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?"
Jim,Did that really need to be said?
Andy,Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
Andy,Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
Jim,"Oh, is she that teacher in the white?"
Andy,"No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef."
Jim,Which one... is she?
Andy,The one in the green hoodie.
Jim,Wow.
Andy,"I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?"
Jim,"No, I don't think so."
Andy,"She's like, probably a tutor."
Jim,Nope.
Andy,She probably a t--
Jim,No.
Andy,Sh---
Jim,No.
Michael,"OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice."
Dwight,"On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair."
Dwight,First rule in road-side beet sales
Dwight,"Hey! Look sharp! Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute."
Chad Lite,"Hi, uh---"
Dwight,"And you must be uh, from the Washington Post."
Chad Lite,"Scranton Times. Chad Lite, ""Lighter Side of Life."""
Dwight,"And ""Breaking Corporate News."""
Chad Lite,And obits.
Dwight,"Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance."
Chad Lite,Oh...
Dwight,"Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?"
Chad Lite,"Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---"
Dwight,Great.
Jim,"Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably..."
Andy,Jamie!
Jim,Andy--- Ohh...
Andy,What are you doing here?
Jamie,Andy?
Andy,Are you a student here?
Jamie,Oh... yeah...
Andy,You never told me you were in high-school!
Jamie,This is weird. I... gotta go to Spanish.
Andy,OH MY GOD!
Jim,Oh my God.
Andy,I had no idea.
Jim,Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Andy,Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
Kevin,"Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am so sorry."
Oscar,"Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale."
Angela,"Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me."
Kelly,"OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing sooo good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?"
Creed,"When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment."
Dwight,Emergency dentist appointment.
Creed,"Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this."
Pam,"Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye."
Barbara,"Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott."
Michael,"Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really."
Michael,"And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first."
Dwight,You look good in this.
Michael,"So, let us consider this matter ended."
Barbara,Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
Michael,"I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry."
Barbara,I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
Michael,"Well, we are extremely sorry."
Barbara,I don't accept.
School Official,I'll be with you in a moment.
Jim,All right.
Andy,Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.
Jim,Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.
Andy,But who was that guy?
Jim,Probably another high-school student.
School Official,The issue with the watermark is very serious.
Jim,Absolutely.
School Official,We teach our students that character counts.
Jim,And you should.
School Official,But---
Andy,Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch.
Jim,Andy... is having a real rough day today.
Andy,"I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---"
Jim,"""Good luck."""
Andy,That's not what I had in mind.
Kelly,Ask where he's from.
Angela,Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? He's upset about the watermark.
Kelly,"OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry."
Angela,It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back...
Kelly,And you're sorry.
Angela,"...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. I think he had Tourette's or something!"
Michael,"We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again."
Barbara,"Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me."
Michael,The watermark... it's a one time thing.
Barbara,I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having s*x?
Dwight,May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.
Michael,OK...
Dwight,"I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right."
Michael,"What... can I do, for you?"
Barbara,"I, for starters, I think that you should resign."
Michael,"Well... OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---"
Barbara,You're the head---
Michael,The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Barbara,You're the head of the company!
Michael,I'm the head of the company?!
Barbara,"Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---"
Michael,"No, I'm a regional manager---"
Barbara,And so you should lose your job!
Michael,"No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!"
Barbara,Fine.
Michael,That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Barbara,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,It's non-transferable...
Michael,Doesn't matter. Out please!
Barbara,I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.
Michael,"Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! Did you get all that?"
Chad Lite,Everything.
Michael,"We gotta do something. This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not..."
Pam,It's just the Scranton Times...
Michael,"No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it..."
Pam,You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Michael,You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. Do you know what this is for?
Pam,Yes.
Pam,Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.
Michael,"OK, I think that's good."
Michael,"""Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."""
Dwight,"Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team."
Michael,That's how devoted I am to this job.
Dwight,I'm just saying...
Michael,I know.
Dwight,They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.
Michael,"I understand that, Dwight."
Dwight,"You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb."
Michael,"Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?"
Dwight,Cut.
Michael,So I'll know where---
Pam,Cut.
Michael,"I'm asking Pam to do it, please."
Pam,Cut.
Michael,"OK, ready?"
Angela,"Kevin, what's four plus seven?"
Kevin,Eleven.
Angela,"Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form."
Kevin,"Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial."
Oscar,Yes.
Angela,You two are apes.
Oscar,"I expect you to apologize for that, Angela."
Angela,I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
Kevin,"Oh, but you still said ""I'm sorry."""
Angela,I called you morons.
Kevin,Still said it.
Oscar,"Still said it, so..."
Michael,"Five, four, three. ""There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day."""
Pam,One day for what?
Michael,That's... they always give an ultimatum.
Pam,OK.
Michael,"Good, cut?"
Pam,Cut. That was your best apology video ever.
Michael,Thought so too.
Creed,Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children.
Creed,"I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic."
Jim,You want music?
Andy,I don't care.
Jim,"Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right."
Andy,Yeah.
Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
Andy,You know what--- I don't---
Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
Andy,Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
Andy,Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
Andy,Sweet.
Jim,Hey.
Michael,Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Jim,"Oh, what's this?"
Pam,"I don't think we really need that, Michael."
Dwight,That is a demerit.
Michael,Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
Jim,"""Jim Halpert, tardiness."" Ugh. I love it already."
Pam,"You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. Coming!"
Dwight,"You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law."
Andy,Think we'll find him?
Jim,"Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?"
Dwight,"Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests."
Dwight,Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Andy,Halvsies?
Jim,Lay it on me.
Dwight,No. Wholesies.
Dwight,Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Andy,"Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot."
Jim,Now that sounds serious.
Dwight,Natch.
Dwight,"Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior."
Andy,"Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera."
Jim,Which would be me.
Dwight,"You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass."
Dwight,That is correct.
Michael,"OK, I am really going to do this."
Jim,"OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation."
Pam,"Good luck, Michael."
Dwight,What's a dis... what's that?
Michael,"You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it."
Jim,"Oh, you don't want to know."
Karen,"OK, remember, be strong."
Pam,"Hey, Phyllis. You all right?"
Michael,I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.
Phyllis,I think I just got flashed.
Pam,Don't leave a -
Pam,What? Really?
Michael,"Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later."
Phyllis,In the parking lot.
Jan,"Michael... I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... I'm sorry."
Pam,"Oh, my God."
Michael,Thank you.
Dwight,Move!
Jan,So... we're good?
Jim,"OK, I'll call the real police."
Michael,Abso-fruit-ly.
Andy,What happened? What can I do to help?
Jan,"Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry."
Jim,OK.
Michael,No... No...
Andy,I'll check the web.
Jan,"One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?"
Jim,Thank you. The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,Can you tell us what happened?
Jan,"OK. ""It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..."""
Phyllis,"Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map."
Michael,"Maybe some Italian. ""... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"" Chinese? ""who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy."""
Angela,Phyllis. You're a married woman.
Jan,Oh.
Creed,"The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?"
Michael,"Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. ""Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?"" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all."
Creed,"If that's flashing, then lock me up."
Dwight,"Dunder-Mifflin paper/s*x predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute."
Pam,"It's just, like, so creepy."
Jim,"Hey, Dwight. It's Jim."
Ryan,Yeah.
Dwight,"Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy."
Michael,What's happening?
Jim,"No, you're not. I'm looking right at you."
Pam,"Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot."
Dwight,Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Michael,Really? Is she OK?
Jim,Don't. I have information about the s*x predator.
Pam,"Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down."
Dwight,You have information about the s*x predator?
Michael,"OK. Phyllis, you say? Hmm."
Jim,I saw him two minutes ago.
Angela,What is so funny?
Dwight,Where?
Michael,"Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?"
Jim,"In the women's bathroom, above the sink."
Kevin,I'm guessing not.
Dwight,Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. PAM!
Michael,I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Jim,"Mm... not really, no."
Pam,It's disgusting and demeaning.
Michael,"Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? OK. He's back! OK. Hmm. Waagh!"
Toby,"Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the..."
Michael,What? Oh.
Toby,What's going on?
Michael,"Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh..."
Toby,I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Michael,"Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul."
Toby,I don't think the women in this office -
Michael,"Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher."
Toby,I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Michael,"Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your pen1s.I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong."
Michael,"In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me."
Jan,"Michael, ..."
Michael,Huh?
Jan,"...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body."
Michael,I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Jan,"I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser."
Michael,"Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable."
Jan,$300?
Michael,"I... uh, well, I don't know."
Jan,"You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?"
Hunter,"You got it, Jan."
Dwight,"Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free."
Michael,I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
Dwight,Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Michael,OK.
Dwight,"There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert."
Michael,"This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight."
Dwight,Look at that one.
Michael,"Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid."
Michael,"Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say."
Dwight,"Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his pen1s - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force."
Jim,Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Dwight,Answer
Pam,Phallus?
Dwight,"Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody."
Pam,"I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things."
Phyllis,I didn't really get a good look.
Pam,That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Karen,"Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? ""Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute."" This is ridiculous."
Dwight,Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Karen,"Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting."
Dwight,Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Pam,"""Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors."" Nobody dress like that."
Michael,"OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that."
Karen,"Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect."
Michael,"See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?"
Dwight,"Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?"
Michael,"No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation."
Jim,"Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?"
Michael,"Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?"
Dwight,"Mm, less than three."
Michael,That is not current.
Dwight,You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Jim,Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Dwight,Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Michael,You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Michael,"I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter."
Creed,"Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?"
Michael,"Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited."
Meredith,I don't remember doing that.
Angela,What a surprise.
Michael,"OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie."
Dwight,Alien. Blagh!
Michael,"What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this."
Andy,"If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models."
Kevin,"Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me."
Karen,What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
Michael,"Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything."
Karen,I'm saying that you're being sexist.
Michael,No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Karen,That - it's the same thing.
Phyllis,Michael.
Michael,Yes.
Phyllis,"When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian."
Michael,Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
Angela,"And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods."
Michael,I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Dwight,I wish I could menstruate.
Dwight,"If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides."
Karen,Can we just get back to work?
Michael,"Ye - OK, yes."
Angela,This is not work talk.
Michael,"You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall."
Karen,"Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that."
Angela,Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Michael,"OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. Let's go!"
Dwight,Have you finished with the sketch?
Pam,Yeah.
Dwight,"Hmm, doesn't seem like the type."
Pam,"Uh, Phyllis got a good look."
Dwight,Hmm.
Dwight,"I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide."
Pam,Oh.
Angela,"Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead."
Meredith,Thanks. I know how to drive.
Pam,"Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter."
Meredith,"My car, my rules."
Kevin,"Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?"
Jim,"No. Thank you, though."
Kevin,You aren't curious?
Jim,Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
Kevin,"Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy."
Jim,"I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it."
Kevin,Yeah. I'm going in.
Jim,Go crazy.
Kevin,Oh... my... God.
Andy,I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Dwight,"Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building."
Andy,This guy looks like a real deviant.
Dwight,"No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those."
Andy,"Aye, aye, Cap'n."
Dwight,"More like, ""Aye, aye, General."""
Michael,I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it -
Meredith,It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Michael,Many women are competent drivers. OK. Come on.
Dwight,This is what we know.
Jim,"Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool."
Kevin,Yes.
Toby,"Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?"
Jim,Anna Maria's.
Ryan,What's the occasion?
Jim,Six-month anniversary. What?
Ryan,"Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up."
Jim,"No, we've been dating for six months."
Ryan,"Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -"
Jim,"Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend."
Ryan,I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Michael,All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
Kelly,"Thanks, Michael."
Angela,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael,"You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish."
Pam,What do you want to dish about?
Michael,"Anything you guys want. This is your time. Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it ""shmear?"" Like the cream cheese."
Pam,"OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?"
Kelly,"Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome."
Michael,"What, um... what do you think of role-play?"
Phyllis,"Oh, it can be fun."
Michael,"Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy."
Karen,It's a pretty common one.
Michael,I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Angela,OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Angela,"Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls."
Pam,"Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with."
Michael,Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.
Pam,"Oh, my God."
Michael,And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
Karen,That is not healthy behavior.
Michael,"No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it."
Pam,"Michael, you need to get out of this."
Michael,"No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing."
Pam,"No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad."
Michael,"No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?"
Pam,Read the pros first.
Michael,"OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt."
Phyllis,She does have very nice clothes.
Karen,"OK, OK. Um, cons."
Michael,Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts
Pam,What was the last one?
Michael,She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Phyllis,"No, the one before that."
Michael,I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
Pam,Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Michael,I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having s*x.
Karen,"Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes."
Michael,"Yeah, that's smart."
Pam,Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Michael,That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
Phyllis,"I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?"
Michael,I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Phyllis,My mom taught me that.
Michael,"Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories."
Pam,No one said it has no calories.
Michael,"Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. Come on. Get in here."
Michael,"Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked."
Kevin,"This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often."
Toby,I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Creed,What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Kevin,You're in here.
Creed,I pay for that privilege.
Kevin,OK.
Creed,I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Michael,"Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear."
Karen,Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Phyllis,Jim's gonna love it.
Pam,I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Angela,Slower. Slower. Meredith. Slow it up.
Michael,"Oh. Oh, no. It's Jan. What do I do?"
Karen,Answer it.
Pam,Don't answer it.
Michael,"OK, it stopped."
Kelly,Whoa.
Meredith,Crap.
Jim,That is pretty cool.
Kelly,"Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?"
Michael,"Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will..."
Pam,"Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on."
Michael,"Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. There we go! Good. Yes, we have the... all right."
Pam,I think I've got it.
Michael,Ughh... Blech.
Group,"One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael."
Dwight,"OK, where does it hurt?"
Michael,Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Michael,Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Creed,On the go that's after three.
Dwight,"No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,Right there.
Group,"One, two, three, go!"
Dwight,"""Abdomen. Menses."""
Dwight,No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Michael,Maybe.
Michael,"Don't, don't."
Dwight,"""The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."""
Dwight,I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Michael,Not it. I don't have eggs.
Group,"Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving."
Pam,"About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned."
Dwight,GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!
Dwight,"Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?"
Michael,I'm not going to give it to you.
Michael,That's possible.
Dwight,"Aaagh, aaagh!"
Pam,Michael?
Group,
Michael,Uh-huh?
Pam,"Michael, do something!"
Pam,David Wallace is on line one.
Dwight,"Aggggh, that stings!"
Michael,The CFO? Ohh...
Michael,"Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. ""Outside Hire."""
Michael,"OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK."
Angela,"Or Mrs. ""Outside Hire."""
Michael,"To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?"
Michael,"Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor."
David,"Michael, I am calling---"
Kelly,Who's Bob Hope?
Michael,And Gromit. Jan? Is Jan there?
Michael,God! He's a comedian.
David,Jan is out of town right now.
Kelly,"Oh, like Amanda Bynes."
Michael,"Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes..."
Michael,Who's Amanda Bynes?
David,Michael?
Kelly,"She's from ""What a Girl Wants."""
Michael,...you just gots to get your freak on.
Michael,"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got."
David,Michael?
Jim,"Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement."
Michael,Yeah.
Michael,You are being too modest.
David,Michael?
Jim,"Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York."
Michael,Hmmm.
Michael,"Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us."
David,I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Dwight,"The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, ""Describe your act."" And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, ""What do you call yourselves?"" And the man says, ""The Aristocrats!"""
Michael,Really?
Pam,"Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh..."
David,Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Dwight,I mean truly repulsive acts.
Michael,Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
Michael,"That is a very, very funny story."
David,That's not necessary.
Pam,"Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day."
Michael,May God guide you in your quest.
Michael,"Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background."
David,Yes.
Group,"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da. From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!"
Michael,"OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus."
Michael,WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
Meredith,"Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt Oh, yeah... I packed it in my purse."
Andy,Nice!
Michael,"Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?"
Oscar,"I don't wear a Speedo, Michael."
Michael,"Well, you can't swim in leather pants. I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally."
Toby,Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
Michael,"Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going."
Toby,It's Beach Day...
Michael,"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here."
Michael,I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Toby,"Hey, want my sun screen?"
Pam,"Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece."
Toby,Uh-huh.
Pam,Thanks Toby.
Michael,"Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you"
Pam,I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Michael,"We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me."
Michael,What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
Pam,You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Michael,"I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?"
Pam,"I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?"
Michael,This way to the partay bus.
Kevin,I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
Kevin,"And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right."" You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done."
Michael,"Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach."
Stanley,"Oh, sweet mother of God."
Michael,"If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus."
Stanley,Excuse me?
Michael,"Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!"
Dwight,Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Michael,"Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off."
Dwight,I hope there will be management parables.
Michael,"Well, Hey Pam, did you get that down?"
Pam,Like what?
Michael,Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Pam,"Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?"
Michael,Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Michael,Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. Watch out for snakes!
Angela,Everyone put on sunscreen.
Michael,"Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor."
Oscar,What?
Michael,"Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley."
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Michael,Jim Halpert. Pros
Dwight,I choose Michael!
Michael,I'm not playing.
Dwight,"OK, temp."
Michael,"Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot."
Michael,We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Dwight,We will be called Gryffindor.
Jim,Really? Not Slytherin?
Dwight,"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim."
Jim,"I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort."
Dwight,He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Jim,"Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!"
Dwight,"OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that."
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?"
Stanley,I don't care what you call my team.
Michael,Then I will name your team the Red team.
Stanley,"No, the blue team."
Michael,I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Andy,We will be team U.S.A.
Michael,"Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic."
Michael,Andy Bernard. Pros
Michael,It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Stanley,"There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon."
Michael,"Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!"
Oscar,"Come on Phyllis, you can do it. Ahh..."
Stanley,Thank you so much.
Andy,"Phyllis is out. Yes! Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good."
Kelly,I don't want to hit the big rock!
Andy,Don't worry. You're not...
Kelly,I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Andy,No where near the big rock.
Kelly,I just don't want to get hit by it...
Andy,"What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified."
Andy,I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!
Jim,"Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole."
Karen,Hole?
Jim,"Yup. Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left."
Dwight,Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Ryan,"Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore."
Dwight,What are you saying?
Ryan,You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Dwight,"OK, I apologize for yelling at you."
Ryan,That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Dwight,I am trying to bring team spirit.
Jim,"Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. Yes!"
Karen,Oh my God! You ass!
Pam,"There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking."
Michael,Pam...you're missing things.
Dwight,Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you b*st*rd! What the? Damn it temp!
Andy,"Great job everyone, that was fantastic."
Michael,"Okay Pam, I have another little project for you."
Pam,Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Michael,"Smart as a whip! Yes! These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it."
Pam,When's the contest?
Michael,Like umm... ten minutes?
Pam,How am I supposed to... get...
Michael,Thanks a bunch.
Michael,A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
Michael,"OK, who's hungry No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set."
Kelly,Can I have a turkey burger?
Michael,"No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?"
Oscar,Turkey is a healthy meat.
Dwight,It's very good for you.
Michael,"Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!"
Phyllis,Is there any mustard?
Michael,"No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily."
Michael,"Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize."
Meredith,What is it?
Michael,I can't say.
Jim,"You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?"
Michael,"The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world."
Kelly,Can we just take those first two things?
Michael,The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
Dwight,You're leaving?
Michael,I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Andy,I am so hungry!
Stanley,Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
Michael,Word. There we go. Let's see it.
Stanley,I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Michael,"Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!"
Kelly,Team U.S.A.!
Andy,One came up.
Michael,"13 hot dogs, everybody!"
Dwight,Damn it!
Creed,Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
Dwight,Sabotage.
Angela,What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Dwight,No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
Angela,I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Dwight,"If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me."
Michael,It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Stanley,"Uh, we don't have any safety mittens"
Michael,Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.
Karen,Get 'em big boy!
Michael,"Aaaaaand, go!"
Karen,"C'mon, Jim!"
Stanley,
Jim,What are you doing?
Michael,"Nice, Stanley!"
Stanley,Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
Jim,Yeah. No. Good.
Jim,"Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day."
Oscar,If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Dwight,Gaaaaa....
Michael,One. Two. Three.
Dwight,Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Michael,Excellent!
Dwight,Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Andy,I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
Dwight,That's not why you lost.
Andy,Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Dwight,"Yeah, right."
Andy,"Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon!"
Dwight,Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Andy,"Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!"
Angela,"What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them?"
Andy,"Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!"
Angela,I don't understand what you want from me.
Andy,"Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!"
Angela,"Sorry! Bye, Andy!"
Andy,Angela!
Michael,"I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?"
Pam,"I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units."
Michael,Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Pam,"I really doubt it, Michael."
Michael,Please just check.
Jim,"Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye."
Karen,"Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well."
Jim,In well?
Karen,As well.
Jim,How would that work in well? I just want to know.
Karen,"Yes. uh, huh."
Jim,Wait a minute.
Karen,That would be fine.
Jim,"If this job is in a well, I don't want it."
Karen,Cut it out!
Jim,I don't!
Michael,What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Stanley,"How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus."
Michael,"Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!"
Michael,Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
Kevin,Are you going to try it?
Angela,I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Kevin,"Angela, it is a million degrees."
Pam,"I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?"
Michael,"No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score."
Pam,I'd like to try it.
Michael,Pointless.
Pam,But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it.
Michael,"Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up."
Jim,Nope.
Michael,Ji.. why not? C'mon.
Jim,"Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned."
Michael,You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Jim,That's harsh.
Michael,Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Andy,"Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello?"
Kevin,Why don't you go Michael?
Michael,Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Jim,"And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself."
Michael,Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay.
Pam,Do you want us to count to three?
Michael,"Yes. Count to three, please."
Group,Three. Two. One.
Michael,"Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one."
Michael,David!
Karen,"No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me."
Jim,How are your feet?
David,"Oh, Michael?"
Jim,Oh...
Pam,Medium rare. Thanks.
Michael,Are we all set?
Karen,'Cause I'm going to get the job.
Jim,The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
David,Isn't our interview tomorrow?
Pam,I know.
Michael,"Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello."
Jim,"And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back."
David,You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Pam,"Well, I wish you would."
Michael,Thought I'd catch a show.
Michael,Remarkable.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you."
David,In the middle of a work day?
Jan,Thanks.
Pam,"I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally---"
Michael,"Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job."
Michael,"Wait, wait. Check one more time."
Jim,"Pam. Sorry. Um, are you free for dinner tonight?"
David,Okay.
Jan,"Oh, okay."
Pam,Yes.
Michael,"Um, how many people are you interviewing?"
Michael,Very good
Jim,All right. Then... it's a date.
David,We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Jan,"Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?"
Pam,"I'm sorry, what was the question?"
Michael,"Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?"
Michael,"Yes, indeed."
David,"So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here."
David,I don't think so.
Jan,Good luck with your interview. Bye.
Ryan,I'm excited too. Okay. Bye.
Michael,Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
Michael,"So, I guess we're getting back together."
Kelly,Who was that?
David,I believe we put you in charge.
Pam,What happened?
Ryan,Nobody. You and I are done.
Michael,"Ah, great. No further questions."
Michael,"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger."
Kelly,What?!
David,"Okay, Michael."
Michael,"Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery."
Michael,Okay.
Karen,So we have all night. Where do you want to go first?
David,I'm really looking forward to our interview.
Jim,"Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?"
Michael,And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
Karen,How often do you come here?
Michael,"I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late."
Jim,"Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip."
Kevin,Hey.
Karen,"I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim."
Jim,"Hey, Kev."
Michael,"Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song"
Kevin,What's different about you? You look worse.
Dwight,Who's ready to work?
Jim,Thank you.
Jim,"Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels."
Meredith,"You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot."
Karen,That wasn't him.
Jim,Ohhh...
Karen,So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Meredith,Turn around.
Jim,Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Jim,No.
Karen,"Well, if you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there."
Meredith,Yes.
Jim,You mean Kevin?
Jim,No way.
Karen,"Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there."
Meredith,Do it!
Jim,"Yeah, I do. C'mon."
Andy,"Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut."
Michael,How are you guys doing? Need anything?
Jim,Andy...
Karen,"Uh, no, we're good. Thanks."
Andy,"What is it, Big Haircut?"
Michael,"I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me."
Jim,Nothing.
Jim,Who's that?
Andy,"Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut."
Michael,That is Beardy.
Jim,Yup.
Jim,Beardy?
Andy,What?
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Jim,"Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless."
Jim,I'm gonna introduce myself.
Pam,Hey. I think it looks great.
Michael,"No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so..."
Jim,"Thanks, Pam."
Michael,"I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep."
Pam,"After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so thank you."
Dwight,Michael is gone.
Michael,Yeah.
Andy,Hail to the chief!
Dwight,You wanted to see me?
Dwight,My first order of business
Michael,"Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute."
Andy,My first order of business
Dwight,"But that's my name. Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. Thank you."
Dwight,As if you had a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime.
Michael,Okay. Uh...
Andy,"Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad."
Dwight,"Thank you, Michael."
Michael,"Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire."
Michael,"Uh, okay."
Hunter,"Uh, administrative assistant."
Dwight,Thank you so much.
Michael,Jan in yet?
Michael,Stop crying.
Hunter,I think she's comin' in... later.
Dwight,Thank you.
Michael,"Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?"
Michael,Ohhhhh...
Hunter,Sure.
Pam,Hey.
Michael,"Just say, ""I want to squeeze them."" It's code. She'll know what it means."
Karen,Hey.
Hunter,Okay.
Pam,"Um, about the beach..."
Michael,"Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, ""Brbrbrbrbr!"" also?"
Karen,"It's okay, we all say things without thinking."
Dwight,You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Pam,"Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird."
Pam,Thank you.
Karen,Oh. Okay.
Dwight,"I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager."
Karen,Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Pam,Really?
Karen,"Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit."
Dwight,"Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position."
Jim,"Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it."
Pam,You will be your own assistant.
Jim,So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Dwight,"Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills."
Michael,Why so you can do it?
Pam,"Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager, and the Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager."
Karen,
Dwight,"Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager."
Jim,Whoops.
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Michael,"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger..."
Dwight,Do you accept?
Jim,Hmmm.
Pam,"Absolutely, I do."
Karen,Heh.
Pam,"I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, ""Absolutely, I do."""
Michael,Moon each other.
Michael,"Hello, hello!"
Jim,"Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?"
David,"Michael, good to see you!"
Michael,All right.
Michael,Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Jim,All right.
David,"Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?"
Michael,Your loss.
Michael,Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
Karen,"Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?"
David,Okay. And your strengths?
Michael,Cruise control.
Michael,"Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths."
Karen,Oh.
David,Oh. Yes. Very good.
Kevin,"So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?"
Michael,Thank you.
Jim,"Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now."
David,Very good.
Kevin,Pam is taller.
Phyllis,Dwight is our new boss.
Jim,You sure?
Oscar,"Oh, Michael's not going anywhere."
Kevin,"Yes. She has bigger breasts, too."
Pam,Then who do you think will get the job?
Jim,Wow.
Kevin,Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.
Kevin,I think Karen has a prettier face.
Phyllis,I think it's gonna be Michael.
Jim,"Uh, hmm. Uh, hmm. What else?"
Oscar,Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
Kevin,Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Phyllis,"No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one."
Jim,Hm. Really tough call.
Oscar,Mm. Yeah.
Kevin,Yeah.
Dwight,"Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch."
Jim,"You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got."
Pam,What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Kevin,Will do.
Dwight,"Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent."
Jim,All right.
Oscar,So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar?
Oscar,"Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship."
Dwight,Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!
Pam,"Wow, very funny."
Stanley,Amen.
Stanley,I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Dwight,"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper."
Kelly,"Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam."
Kevin,Do we have to?
Pam,
Dwight,"Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is ""me."" Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!"
Meredith,"You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said."
Pam,I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.
Creed,I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
David,What do you think we could be doing better?
Creed,www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
Michael,"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, ""Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, ""Super Duper Paper. It's super duper."" I don't know, something like that."
Ryan,Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
David,Okay!
Michael,"There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks."
Michael,Okay.
Kevin,Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
David,"Thanks for comin' in, Michael."
Michael,"No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me."
Michael,Thank you.
Oscar,Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
David,It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Michael,"No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo."
Michael,"It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again."
Oscar,Michael...
David,You're back together.
Kevin,What?
Michael,"Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals."
Angela,Why?
David,"Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job."
Oscar,"I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense."
Michael,"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?"
Michael,"Yes, I..."
David,"No, we're letting Jan go."
Angela,Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Dwight,Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from?
Kevin,"Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo..."
Kevin,Trees.
Michael,I have to buy another place.
Dwight,Trees! And where do trees grow?
Angela,But you said you were in debt.
Kevin,Forest.
Oscar,You're not sure that you have the job.
Dwight,"Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?"
Michael,"I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time."
Stanley,Liquid.
Dwight,"How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?"
Dwight,Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Angela,"No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome."
Stanley,I don't want it.
Dwight,"No, no, not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job."
Dwight,Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Angela,"Not now. Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor."
Stanley,Make it 100.
Dwight,"Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim."
Dwight,We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
Jim,"Oh hey, Dwight."
Stanley,"No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again."
Dwight,I am gonna be your new boss. It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.
Dwight,What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Jim,Does my room have cable?
Stanley,The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
Dwight,No. And the sheets are made of fire.
Dwight,Okay---
Jim,Can I change rooms?
Andy,That's it!
Dwight,"Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town."
Dwight,What---
Jim,Can I have a late checkout?
Andy,"Class is canceled, everybody out!"
Dwight,I'll have to talk to the manager.
Dwight,"No wait, what are you doing?!"
Jim,You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Andy,I'm punishing them.
Dwight,I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!
Dwight,"No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled."
Jim,"Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?"
Everyone,
Dwight,"Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet."
Pam,HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation!
Jim,Go.
Oscar,What--- What are you winking for?
Dwight,Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Dwight,Zip your lid!
Dwight,Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Karen,"So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows?"
Andy,I will see you at the inter-view.
David,"Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but..."
Dwight,Yes you will.
Karen,Yeah?
Michael,Who is D. Abramson?
David,...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Pam,He's from that company in Pitts...
Karen,He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
Jan,Michael.
David,This is off the record.
Michael,Why... are you here?
Karen,He would be disaster.
Jan,"Uh, how are you?"
Jan,Hey you!
Michael,"I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you."
Michael,Hey.
Jan,"I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?"
Jan,How was your interview?
Michael,Why privately?
Michael,Pretty good.
Jan,"I just, I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things."
Jan,Yeah?
Michael,"Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of."
Michael,Could have gone better I guess.
Jan,Okay.
Jan,Oh. I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael,Okay.
Michael,Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Michael,"Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem."
Jan,What?
Pam,What do you want me to do?
Michael,"Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun."
Michael,"Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen."
Jan,What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there?
Pam,What about Meredith?
Michael,I can't tell you.
Michael,No. She's an alternate.
Jan,Tell me what?
Michael,"So, how you been?"
Jan,You son of a bitch!
Jan,Been good.
David,"Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---"
Michael,Good.
Jan,You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Jan,Good.
David,"Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic."
Michael,Yeah.
Jan,Erratic?
Jan,"Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail."
David,"Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---"
Michael,"Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages."
Jan,Is it because of these?
Pam,"So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room."
Michael,"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---"
Karen,'Cause of Jan again?
Jan,"No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!"
Karen,"Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?"
David,It's not.
Pam,"Uh, sure."
Jan,No?
Karen,Thanks.
David,It's not.
Pam,I really hope you get the job.
Jan,"'Cause he likes them. Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about."
Karen,Thanks.
David,The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.
Jan,"After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation."
Michael,Hey! You're unstable!
Michael,Hmm.
Jan,Yeah!
Jan,To kinda clear my mind.
Michael,No--- We're all unstable.
Michael,Sound good. Sounds fun.
Jan,"Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving."
Jan,"It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time."
Michael,"David, I did not tell her."
Michael,Hmm..
Andy,"It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall."
Jan,I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Dwight,"It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black."
Michael,Would you excuse me for a second?
Andy,This is gonna look so awesome!
Jan,Ohh...
Dwight,"It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!"
Michael,Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.
Andy,Totally!
Phyllis,What are you gonna do?
Jan,Bye Hunter.
Michael,"I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please..."
Hunter,Bye.
Karen,Do you want to get back together with her?
Jan,Good luck with your band.
Michael,"No, no. What do I do?"
Hunter,"Oh, thank---"
Pam,Just don't get back together with her.
Jan,"Don't let them change you, okay? So long,."
Michael,What if she makes me?
Michael,"So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job."
Angela,How can she make you get back together with her?
David,"Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction."
Michael,She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
Michael,"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions."
Pam,This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
David,"No, we're not giving you the job."
Michael,I wasn't.
Michael,"You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?"
Pam,You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
David,I do.
Michael,You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Michael,"Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though."
Pam,Right.
David,Yes.
Michael,Wow.
Michael,Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two. Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Karen,Do it.
Karen,Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Michael,I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Jim,Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.
Michael,"Okay. Jan, we need to talk."
Karen,Don't! She's nuts!
Michael,"Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out."
Jim,"Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want."
Pam,Oh my God. Huge!
Karen,"Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so..."
Jim,"Yeah, bigger actually."
Jim,Okay.
Pam,That's crazy!
Karen,Just call me when you're done.
Jim,Mm-hm.
Jim,Sure.
Pam,Wow!
Karen,"Good luck, Halpert."
Karen,Oh my God. Can you believe that?
Jim,Thank you.
Jim,Unbelievable.
Receptionist,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure."
Karen,Wow!
Jan,"Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy!"
Jim,She could put the cup right there.
Michael,"I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible."
Karen,I know!
Jan,"Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so..."
Pam,"No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that one time."
Michael,"Well, it's... No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK."
Meredith,"I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front."
Jan,"Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?"
Kevin,"I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers."
Michael,I don't know. Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
Creed,"I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots."
Jan,"Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5"
Jan,So... there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Michael,I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,How'd it go?
Jan,"I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities."
Michael,"No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon."
Michael,First got priorities.
Michael,"Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. ""Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in."" Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?"
Jan,And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Dwight,To intimidate my subordinates.
Michael,Let's get back together.
Michael,That's stupid.
Michael,"No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent."
Dwight,It was Andy's idea.
Dwight,"Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process! Andrew Bernard."
Michael,"You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. Ryan, coffee."
Andy,Saving the best for first!
Ryan,I don't do that stuff anymore.
Karen,"All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck!"
Michael,"No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids."
Dwight,"No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael."
Michael,"So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones."
Oscar,"Good luck, you guys!"
Pam,Did... Karen get the job?
Dwight,What did I say!?
Michael,Back to work. Still waitin' on that coffee.
Pam,Good luck.
Dwight,"Pam, hello."
Jim,Thanks.
Pam,"Dwight, hello."
Pam,"I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. That's Popeye."
Dwight,"I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity."
Dwight,I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?
Pam,"No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay."
Andy,"White, because it contains all other colors."
David,I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Dwight,Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?
Jim,I should leave.
Andy,"You make a chair, but you don't sit on it."
David,"Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy."
Dwight,What is the capital of Maine?
Jim,Thanks.
Andy,"The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell."
David,"Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---"
Dwight,"Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company."
Jim,"I'm sorry, wait, so is the question ""How'd I get to be so awesome?"" Because, I don't have an answer for you."
Andy,Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
David,"Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?"
Dwight,"You're not off to a very good start, Bernard."
Jim,"Yes, absolutely."
Andy,"I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?"
David,"And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out..."
Andy,I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has
Jim,"Oh, no, absolutely."
Dwight,"Time! No, you failed."
David,"...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like. Kendall. Ugh. So, first up..."
Andy,Damn it!
Jim,There you go.
Dwight,This interview is over. I'll let you know.
David,How do you think you function here in New York?
Karen,"Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview."
Jim,"What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight. So that's a... bonus."
Jim,"Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or..."
David,You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. What have you liked most about that place?
Karen,"Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house."
Jim,The friendships.
Jim,"Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish?"
David,"Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years?"
Michael,"Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours."
Kevin,"Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!"
Michael,This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed.
Pam,"I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know."
IT Tech Guy,You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?
Pam,"Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam."
Pam,It was for a video.
Michael,Pro-Am.
IT Tech Guy,"Yeah, what kind of video?"
Pam,Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
Pam,A celebrity s*x tape.
Michael,"A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that."
Jim,"Really, what kind of celebrity?"
Stanley,"No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?"
Pam,Not relevant.
Michael,"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?"
Jim,How much did you pay for it?
Stanley,Zero.
Pam,Not relevant.
Michael,"Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00."
Jim,You paid for it?
Andy,Isn't that your money?
Pam,It all happened so fast.
Michael,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?"
Jim,"I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody."
Phyllis,"Oh, it's coming."
Pam,Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
Michael,"Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis."
Kevin,"Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile"
Kevin,Michael?
Oscar,"I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things."
Michael,Yes.
Kevin,Are you kidding me?
Kevin,You cannot make me run.
Pam,And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Michael,OK.
Jim,Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Kevin,"It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it."
Pam,Cool.
Michael,"Alright, alright."
Jim,Yeah.
Kevin,You didn't run for me...
Pam,Well have fun with that.
Michael,Shhh...
Michael,Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Kevin,...when I thought I had skin cancer.
Jim,What?
Michael,I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
Dwight,Where?
Kevin,No.
Michael,"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK."
Michael,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant."
Stanley,What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Kevin,I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Oscar,So she's really going to be fine?
Michael,"Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore."
Michael,"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse."
Andy,"I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions."
Pam,Thank God you were there.
Andy,"Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat."
Michael,Yeah.
Angela,"This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, just a couple of kittens out on the town."
Andy,Did you see who did it?
Angela,"Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice."
Dwight,No need we can just check the security tapes.
Pam,What's wrong?
Michael,Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
Angela,"I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat."
Jim,Who was driving?
Pam,Hmm...
Pam,"Oh, Michael."
Angela,"When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds."
Jim,One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
Pam,Ah.
Dwight,It's only Meredith.
Angela,Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
Michael,"Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something."
Pam,"Angela, I'm sorry."
Dwight,Hey... Why did you do it?
Angela,Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Michael,It was an accident.
Pam,I'm more of a dog person.
Dwight,Was she talkin' back?
Angela,
Michael,No.
Jim,So what's your strategy for this race?
Dwight,Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Pam,Well I'm gonna start fast.
Pam,"Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers."
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Kevin,"Who's we, you and Jim?"
Pam,Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
Pam,"No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far."
Jim,What?
Kevin,"Oh, I bet Jim goes too."
Pam,Then I'm gonna end fast.
Pam,"Yeah, I haven't asked him yet."
Jim,Why won't more people do that?
Kevin,"Oh, I bet you ask?"
Pam,Cause they're just stupid.
Pam,I was planning on it.
Jim,What?
Kevin,I bet you were.
Jim,"Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah..."
Pam,Angela?
Pam,Yeah... That was um...
Oscar,Subtle.
Jim,"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything."
Kevin,What
Pam,"Yeah, I gave him a ride home because..."
Pam,Are you coming?
Jim,Right!
Angela,"I can't, Sprinkles is sick."
Pam,... We're dating.
Angela,"She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles."
Jim,Wow! There it is.
Angela,"I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?"
Pam,"Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. Right?"
Pam,Can't your other cats keep her company.
Jim,It is going really great.
Angela,"There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques."
Dwight,Oww!
Pam,"Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job."
Angela,Shut up.
Angela,All right!
Dwight,"You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger."
Michael,My lord my liege.
Angela,"Oh, really?"
Ryan,Yes Michael?
Dwight,You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
Michael,"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?"
Angela,I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
Michael,So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
Michael,"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?"
Ryan,Back? Why is that Michael?
Pam,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?"
Michael,"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car."
Michael,Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
Ryan,Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
Jim,"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check."
Michael,"No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in..."
Pam,Giant check it is.
Ryan,Did this happen on company property?
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine."
Michael,Yep.
Ryan,I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Dwight,"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control."
Michael,"Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is"
Jim,Bat birth control
Ryan,
Dwight,"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed."
Ryan,"People keep calling me a ""Wunderkind"""
Michael,You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Angela,Hey D.
Pam,"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check."
Dwight,"Hey monkey, what's up?"
Jim,Which we are.
Angela,Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Pam,And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Dwight,Sure.
Michael,What about a rabies nurse?
Angela,I have to visit the alchy.
Pam,I don't think so.
Dwight,"Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what"
Jim,"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events."
Angela,I wouldn't put it past her.
Michael,That's possible. Look into that.
Dwight,So what do you need me to do?
Jim,"Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips."
Angela,I wrote it out.
Dwight,Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Dwight,Mm-hmm.
Michael,Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
Angela,"There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail."
Pam,"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles."
Michael,"Ok, I have an announcement."
Michael,Come in.
Oscar,You pushed Darryl out the window?
Pam,Hey.
Michael,No.
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey"
Phyllis,You shot Dwight?
Pam,Oh my God.
Michael,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree."
Michael,What are you doing?
Jim,"Oh good, so we don't have to work."
Pam,You said come in!
Pam,"OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1."
Michael,"No I didn't, just please don't..."
Michael,"So, like a freedom tree."
Pam,Oh my God.
Pam,I can take 3 people.
Pam,So I closed the door but the image of his...
Jim,I can also take 3 people.
Jim,Baquette.
Oscar,Separate cars.
Pam,... dangling participle...
Michael,Pam.
Jim,Eww.
Pam,"Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room."
Pam,... still burned in my eyes.
Michael,Pam.
Jim,I can imagine.
Pam,Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Pam,Come in.
Michael,"Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch."
Michael,May I enter the room?
Pam,I...
Pam,Yes. Or come in.
Michael,Excellent!
Michael,See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
Pam,I was thinking that we...
Jim,You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
Michael,Good work Pam.
Michael,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that."
Pam,But...
Pam,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark."
Michael,"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?"
Michael,European offices are naked all the time.
Stanley,You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
Pam,They're so not.
Michael,"Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!"
Michael,Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
Michael,"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make."
Pam,I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
Michael,Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
Jim,Gross.
Kelly,She looks awful.
Michael,"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun."
Michael,"No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault."
Jim,Alright.
Jim,I think she's awake.
Pam,They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
Michael,No... She's in a coma.
Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?"
Nurse,No.
Jan,"OK, name please."
Michael,"OK... Meredith, Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear."
Creed,"Creed Bratton, 75 plus division."
Meredith,At the same time.
Jan,You're over 75 years old?
Michael,Yeah.
Creed,82 November first. How much is the prize money?
Stanley,Hello Meredith.
Jan,There's no prize money.
Meredith,This is weird.
Creed,"What, is any of this real?"
Michael,"Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!"
Michael,"Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?"
Kevin,Whoa!
Jan,So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Michael,Nurse.
Pam,"What? Look, no it was not..."
Meredith,"No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in."
Jan,"I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off."
Michael,I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
Michael,"OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth"
Jim,I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Darryl,I'm giving him a peanut.
Nurse,"What, what are you doing? Just gimme that."
Michael,"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?"
Meredith,Thanks.
Darryl,Look how happy he is.
Kevin,
Michael,"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? This is the reason we're here."
Phyllis,Does it hurt terribly?
Elizabeth,Hello Michael.
Meredith,"No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers."
Michael,"Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?"
Creed,"Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What..."
Elizabeth,Yeah.
Meredith,I have no idea.
Michael,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands."
Creed,Oh.
Elizabeth,Great.
Meredith,Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Michael,You got it?
Michael,"Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody."
Dwight,Mm-hmm.
Meredith,"Michael, I'm not gonna do that."
Michael,"OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load."
Michael,Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
Michael,"Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing."
Angela,"No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness."
Dwight,"On your marks, get set..."
Michael,"Well, just shhhh... just just..."
Michael,Beow!
Meredith,You cracked my pelvis
Toby,Hey!
Michael,"Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug."
Michael,On your left!
Meredith,You're not forgiven.
Oscar,"You're doing great Michael, look at you go!"
Michael,Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Creed,That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
Pam,Michael! Michael!
Michael,"I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot."
Meredith,
Stanley,Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
Michael,Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
Andy,"I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance."
Angela,Hey.
Pam,Yeah. Oh we're in last place.
Dwight,Hey monkey.
Jim,"Oh, would you look at that."
Angela,Any problems?
Pam,Darn it.
Dwight,"Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead."
Jan,Water? Water? Water babe?
Angela,What!?
Michael,"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!"
Dwight,"Sparkles, the white one, is dead."
Jan,Michael that's irrational.
Angela,Sprinkles.
Michael,Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
Dwight,"That was the sick one, right?"
Andy,"Oh God! My nipples, it's starting."
Angela,Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
Creed,Can we get another round?
Dwight,No.
Waitress,OK.
Angela,Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
Creed,Thanks.
Dwight,Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
Stanley,"So we've got what, another 20 minutes?"
Angela,
Oscar,More or less.
Dwight,"So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place."
Stanley,Hmmm...
Angela,Alright.
Michael,That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
Dwight,"Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor."
Dwight,"You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race."
Angela,
Michael,"Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?"
Pam,It's gonna be OK.
Toby,"I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today."
Michael,"OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just..."
Jim,Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
Pam,"Michael, Angela's cat died."
Pam,I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
Michael,Sprinkles?
Jim,"OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured."
Angela,
Pam,Mmm... Yes.
Michael,"Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the p0rn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it."
Jim,That's what I thought.
Michael,"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
Jim,Right. Let's do some good.
Oscar,Like what?
Ryan,"for the cure... leave a message"" Ryan hangs up]"
Michael,Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
Michael,"Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch."
Toby,"No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies."
Andy,"Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin."
Pam,That's cool.
Kevin,Back off me.
Toby,Yeah.
Dwight,"How ya feeling, better?"
Michael,Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Angela,No.
Angela,Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Dwight,Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Dwight,She's only a cat.
Angela,The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Angela,You never... you don't like them.
Dwight,I am a farmer Angela.
Dwight,Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Angela,What does that mean?
Oscar,Dwight please!
Dwight,"OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do."
Michael,"Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?"
Angela,You did kill her!?
Dwight,"No, I have not."
Dwight,"I... I sang her, her favorite songs."
Michael,"Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects."
Angela,You put her in my freezer.
Dwight,"I do not respect her, but I will go."
Dwight,It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Michael,"Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs."
Angela,Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Toby,"Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs..."
Dwight,Well I'm not responsible for that!
Michael,Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
Angela,You!
Toby,"Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs."
Dwight,"Hey, Oww! It's OK."
Michael,"Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in."
Angela,It's OK.
Stanley,"I'm... um, Catholic."
Dwight,"It's nothing, I'm robbing her."
Michael,OK.
Angela,It's nothing.
Darryl,Presbyterian.
Dwight,It's fine. What?
Michael,Alright.
Angela,How could you do that without telling me?
Pam,Oh me too.
Dwight,"I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how."
Darryl,Oh?
Angela,"Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized."
Pam,Same religion.
Dwight,"I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good."
Darryl,Alright!
Angela,You don't understand.
Phyllis,I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Michael,Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
Angela,That's why we're cursed.
Dwight,"Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?"
Creed,"I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader."
Angela,Don't touch me Dwight!
Michael,"Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha."
Pam,"You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00."
Kelly,That's Buddhist.
Jim,"Oh, and I get to carry it."
Michael,Are you sure?
Toby,And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
Kelly,No.
Kelly,"Have a seat, I'll write it down."
Michael,What are you?
Toby,Where are we?
IT Tech Guy,"Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time."
Kelly,"I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office."
Michael,"OK, 1 Sikh, and..."
Toby,He couldn't have made it a circle?
Dwight,"As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical."
Michael,"I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it."
Dwight,Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Jim,...talk about it.
Meredith,Don't pull any plugs.
Pam,"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?"
Intern,How are you doing Ms. Palmer?
Jim,"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or..."
Meredith,Better.
Michael,"I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just..."
Intern,Excellent.
Jim,"Well, you're probably dehydrated."
Dwight,"Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?"
Michael,What do you want me to do Jim?
Intern,"Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but..."
Jim,Glass of water would be a start.
Dwight,"Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one."
Michael,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins."
Intern,"Ah, so uh... so that is where her uterus went... Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?"
Jim,Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Meredith,"Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head."
Pam,I'm still having a nice day.
Dwight,Just doing my job.
Jim,You are?
Intern,It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
Pam,"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00."
Meredith,And a rat. Separate occasions.
Michael,That's a good deal.
Michael,"You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead."
Pam,"And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much."
Kelly,If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
Michael,"Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done."
Michael,"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine."
Pam,"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping."
Jim,I will do some research.
Michael,"You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference."
Pam,I can help you with that.
Pam,"I know you Michael, I saw you naked."
Dwight,"So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine."
Michael,"You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my pen1s. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k No, no!"
Michael,"Oh God, Rabies?"
Michael,"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that."
Dwight,Mm-hmm.
Meredith,Hey Michael.
Michael,"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?"
Michael,Hey Mer. How ya doing?
Dwight,"No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something."
Meredith,Better.
Michael,This place is so cursed.
Michael,"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water."
Dwight,"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw."
Meredith,"I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore."
Michael,"I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it."
Michael,"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. Wanna share?"
Jim,"Six of one, really."
Meredith,Sure.
Michael,"Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished."
Michael,"I'm not really sick. Nah, I'm good."
Michael,"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?"
Pam,Hey.
Robert Dunder,"Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy."
Michael,"We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!"
Jim,Hey.
Michael,"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you."
Dwight,Take a stand!
Pam,I gotcha one.
Dwight,"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation."
Pam,"So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo."
Jim,"Oh wow, thank you."
Robert Dunder,I started this company in 1949.
Ryan,"I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,Wow.
Pam,Thanks.
Jim,"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?"
Robert Dunder,"Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction."
Ryan,I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Pam,"No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?"
Michael,"Oh, boy."
Pam,That'd be great.
Jim,I guess. How dare you.
Robert Dunder,"And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club."
Ryan,Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Michael,Hey Toby. What's this?
Michael,Great.
Pam,Oh... is it...
Toby,Ohh.
Robert Dunder,"And he was, he was at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys."
Ryan,Wear something nice.
Michael,I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Michael,Great.
Pam,No...
Toby,"Yes, uh some people in the office have complained..."
Robert Dunder,And...
Ryan,What?
Michael,Oh really.
Michael,That's great. Thank you for coming in. Robert Dunder everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Pam,Um...
Toby,"...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that."
Robert Dunder,"Well I, I, I came here in a cab."
Ryan,I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Michael,"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight..."
Michael,Perfect.
Pam,"I'm uh, I'm dating Jim."
Toby,"Ok, look the memo is not about you..."
Robert Dunder,"Well, cou, could you get me another..."
Ryan,You're kidding?
Angela,"For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity."
Michael,"Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail."
Pam,We're together.
Toby,"Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So..."
Pam,I think that I should help him get home.
Ryan,"That's... great, I... that's awesome."
Michael,No way.
Michael,"No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. What a nice guy."
Pam,"Yeah, great."
Dwight,What?
Ryan,"So let me um, let me look at these."
Phyllis,You guys are together?
Pam,OK great!
Jim,"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are."
Ryan,Cool.
Michael,Woooah! Wow!
Michael,Good night guys.
Pam,Great.
Andy,Tuna!
Ryan,"Well, today was a fantastic waste of time."
Jim,I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
Michael,Awesome!
Michael,"I disagree, I think it was very valuable."
Ex-client,Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
Kevin,I knew it!
Ryan,"Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving."
Michael,"Give it back. The gift basket, give it back."
Michael,You guys! Yes! Yes!
Michael,I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Ex-client,Oh what is this?
Pam,"Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?"
Ryan,Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. Where do you wanna go?
Dwight,"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket."
Toby,Yes.
Kelly,"You know, some place romantic and expensive."
Ex-client,Maybe you should leave.
Michael,"Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, stand up. OK, here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one."
Ryan,"Kelly, come on."
Michael,"Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!"
Jim,"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months."
Kelly,"You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it."
Dwight,"Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna Oops, sorry!"
Michael,"I love you guys, so much."
Dwight,Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Michael,"Look, my clothes are so wet!"
Jim,Ohh..
Angela,Very much. How's your meat?
Dwight,"Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!"
Pam,Phone's ringing.
Dwight,Dry. Delicious.
Ex-client,"Alright here you go, take it back!"
Michael,"No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest."
Angela,I heard a joke today.
Michael,It's been opened.
Dwight,I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
Dwight,"Oh, that's funny."
Ex-client,Yeah it was mine!
Angela,It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
Angela,"Yes, it was."
Michael,What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
Andy,Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
Dwight,Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Ex-client,"Come on guys, get out of here!"
Michael,Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
Angela,I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
Michael,WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
Phyllis,Did you plan it?
Dwight,"Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here, it's an old sales trick."
Dwight,"Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!"
Michael,No.
Angela,I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
Ex-client,"I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!"
Pam,Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Dwight,"No, please don't do this, monkey."
Dwight,We'll bill you.
Michael,Blowing up balloons I thought.
Angela,I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.
Michael,"May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now."
Pam,You might want to trim it a little.
Ryan,That is not correct.
Phyllis,Michael...
Toby,"Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy."
Michael,Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Kelly,"Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?"
Pam,Hi.
Oscar,You did what?
Pam,"Yeah, he is."
Jim,"Hey, Amy. How ya doing?"
Michael,"I drove my car into a lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me."
Kelly,Oh.
Pam,Nice to meet you.
Jim,Into a lake.
Michael,Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
Jim,Nice to meet you.
Michael,Exactly!
Angela,What do you want?
Toby,This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
Phyllis,Did you get any clients back?
Dwight,To give you this.
Amy,"Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?"
Michael,"Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game."
Angela,"Oh, what is that?"
Toby,Absolutely.
Michael,"Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy."
Dwight,It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Amy,Whoa. Easy tiger.
Ryan,"I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars."
Angela,Her name was Sprinkles.
Toby,I just really like you.
Dwight,And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. Don't you Garbage?
Amy,Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you.
Ryan,You should come visit. The city is... amazing.
Angela,I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
Toby,Have a great day!
Jim,I know. I love it there.
Dwight,You haven't buried her yet?
Pam,"Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo."
Ryan,No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
Angela,Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
Toby,I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
Jim,"Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun."
Dwight,"Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him."
Michael,Smell that. Do you smell that?
Ryan,"No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless."
Angela,I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!
Dwight,Dry rot?
Jim,Sounds great.
Pam,Hey Toby.
Michael,"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer."
Ryan,No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
Toby,Hey... you two.
Andy,"Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles."
Jim,Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
Jim,"Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company."
Michael,"Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later."
Toby,"Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really."
Michael,"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food."
Jim,Oh.
Dwight,"Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items."
Pam,"Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official."
Angela,Thank you.
Toby,Uh huh.
Dwight,You're welcome.
Jim,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?"
Angela,Is that all?
Toby,Let's just wait and see what happens. You know?
Dwight,Yes... I miss you.
Jim,What?
Angela,Elevators.
Toby,Let's just wait.
Angela,"Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?"
Jim,"Oh, OK."
Dwight,Fine. Then I just want to be friends.
Pam,OK.
Angela,Good.
Jim,Great.
Dwight,"Plus a little extra. Also, I love you."
Pam,Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Angela,
Ryan,Hold on one second. Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Kelly,I don't understand what the big deal is.
Michael,Hey!
Ryan,You don't?
Pam,Yeah.
Kelly,No!
Michael,"There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs."
Ryan,You lied about being pregnant.
Ryan,OK. Should we get started?
Kelly,"Right, so?"
Michael,"Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.."
Ryan,You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
Ryan,"Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting."
Kelly,No!
Michael,...business meeting --
Ryan,We're never getting back together.
Kevin,Fire!
Kelly,Why not?
Ryan,Stop that! Stop that!
Jim,Hey.
Michael,That's right! That's right!
Pam,Hey.
Ryan,You scared me.
Jim,"Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?"
Michael,"Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan."
Pam,It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
Andy,Fire guy
Jim,"I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?"
Kevin,You weren't here for that.
Pam,"I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but..."
Andy,Here for what?
Jim,Be honest.
Kevin,When he started the fire.
Pam,I now find you repulsive.
Michael,"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man..."
Jim,"That's honest. Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?"
Kevin,Little old man boy.
Pam,Eh...
Ryan,"Michael and everybody, umm..."
Jim,"For me, it was."
Michael,Beard.
Pam,OK.
Kevin,Bearded man boy.
Jim,Alright.
Ryan,"...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan."
Michael,"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today."
Michael,"Oh, wow!"
Ryan,"What's, uh, going on here?"
Ryan,So...
Michael,"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back."
Michael,That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Ryan,With gift baskets.
Ryan,OK...
Michael,"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like."
Michael,Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Michael,"Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. ""You can't be on the team"", ""You can't move on to second grade"". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class."
Ryan,Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Michael,"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy."
Michael,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in 10 minutes?"
Stanley,I'm not driving with him.
Ryan,Perfect.
Andy,I'll go with you Stanley.
Michael,"Sounds good. OK, alright."
Stanley,Or him.
Michael,"Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, ""Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you."" His words."
Jim,Why don't we just go by ourselves?
Ryan,Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Michael,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
Jim,"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it."
Phyllis,Michael.
Ryan,This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Michael,Yes?
Michael,"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme."
Phyllis,This is stupid.
Ryan,I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Michael,"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis."
Dwight,What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Phyllis,How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Ryan,"This is company-wide, Dwight."
Michael,"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve."
Dwight,Got it.
Andy,"What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever."
Ryan,Andy.
Jim,What about a gift basket full of cash?
Andy,"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?"
Andy,Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Ryan,Any other questions? Kelly Kapoor.
Michael,"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me."
Kelly,Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Dwight,"Michael, wait. Let me go."
Ryan,Thank you everybody.
Michael,"No, this is my quest."
Michael,Ryan Howard everybody. Good job.
Dwight,"Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. Please."
Creed,That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Michael,Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Ryan,"As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system."
Ryan,Good luck Michael.
Creed,Cool beans.
Michael,We don't need luck.
Creed,We're screwed.
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,Who is?
Michael,"But thank you, that was really nice of you to say."
Creed,Us? You and me. The old timers.
Dwight,Thank you.
Michael,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Michael,"Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people."
Creed,"You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners."
Ryan,"Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing."
Jim,"Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months."
Creed,"Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater."
Pam,No..
Dwight,"Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?"
Jim,"Swear to God.. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun."
Michael,It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
Pam,"No, they have been dating for like two years. Since before your barbeque."
Dwight,"Ah, that's a pain in the ass."
Jim,Wait. What? You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Michael,I know. So who's next?
Pam,You didn't say anything to me?
Dwight,Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Jim,Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
GPS,"Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin."
Pam,Can you believe that...
Dwight,Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Phyllis,"Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here."
Michael,Who?
Jim,"Oh no, we're just sitting here."
Dwight,"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends."
Phyllis,"I couldn't see your hands. Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?"
Ryan,"Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn."
Pam,OK.
Kevin,No way!
Phyllis,OK.
Ryan,Literally.
Jim,OK.
Andy,"Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do."
Jim,And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
Ryan,... Later guys.
Ryan,"OK, what's up?"
Kevin,"Yeah, later dude."
Michael,"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?"
Andy,Later man.
Ryan,"Well it is business, but not as usual."
Kevin,"Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?"
Michael,"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?"
Jim,"Yeah, he's definitely something."
Ryan,"No. We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system."
Kevin,What does that mean?
Michael,"Good, so, we're on the same page?"
Jim,"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?"
Ryan,"No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself."
Andy,Ha! Tuna... Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Michael,"We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans."
Kevin,Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Ryan,"So, how are you?"
Andy,"He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes."
Kelly,Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
Kevin,And he can get any girl that he wants.
Ryan,Good.
Andy,"So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons."
Kelly,A lot. Black guys mostly.
Kevin,Tuna. Check you later.
Ryan,Kelly...
Michael,"Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?"
Kelly,What?!
Larry Myers,You know we closed our account with you right?
Phyllis,"Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?"
Michael,Yes we do.
Stanley,I don't know.
Larry Myers,We're with Office Depot now.
Phyllis,Did you even try?
Dwight,"Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you."
Stanley,"If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him."
Michael,Well...
Phyllis,I can't see half of the things.
Dwight,"And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us."
Stanley,It's too little. Use the phone.
Michael,Mmhmm.
Kelly,I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
Larry Myers,OK. I don't think we're coming back.
Ryan,"Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend."
Dwight,"Please, come back."
Kelly,"Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me."
Michael,"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch."
Ryan,"I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship."
Dwight,Remember what we had Larry?
Kelly,"Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant."
Larry Myers,"I mean, really it's about money."
Kelly,
Michael,"Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket."
Kelly,"And guess what buddy, I am keeping it."
Larry Myers,OK thanks.
Ryan,OK. OK.
Michael,Alright.
Kelly,Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
Larry Myers,I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.
Ryan,"I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?"
Michael,That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Kelly,We have a date!
Dwight,I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Dwight,Hello.
Michael,That is true.
Angela,"Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?"
Dwight,Like Angela in accounting.
Dwight,Really?
Michael,"Yes, she is nuts."
Angela,Yes.
Dwight,"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy."
Dwight,"I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side."
GPS,Make the next right turn.
Angela,I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
Michael,How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
Jan,"Hi, Pam."
Ryan,Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
Pam,Hi.
Pam,Uh totally.
Jan,Is Michael in?
Ryan,"Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?"
Pam,In his office. You can go right in.
Pam,Yeah.
Jan,Hey.
Ryan,Thank you very much.
Ryan,Jan.
Pam,Thank you.
Jan,"Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan."
Ryan,Cool.
Ryan,"So elephant in the room, I have your old job."
Pam,OK.
Jan,"Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title."
Pam,"Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited."
Ryan,"Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities."
Michael,"And the last guy says ""No, hairy body""."
Jan,"Different salary. You'll get there, don't worry."
Ex-client,You know I have heard it before.
Ryan,Well... you look great.
Michael,"Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?"
Jan,"Thank you, thank you."
Ex-client,"She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory."
Ryan,Scranton suits you.
Michael,"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider."
Jan,Best decision I ever made.
Ex-client,"Oh, OK."
Ryan,You were let go.
Michael,"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?"
Jan,You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.
Ex-client,OK thanks for the goodies.
Michael,Hey.
Michael,Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Jan,Hey.
Ex-client,It looks delicious? I don't know.
Michael,"Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?"
Dwight,You don't know?
Jan,What?
Michael,"Look, we want you back."
Michael,I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Ex-client,Can you offer lower prices?
Jan,"So, what's Ryan doing here?"
Michael,"Well, no."
Michael,"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people."
Ex-client,Then we're not coming back.
Jan,He's such a snake.
Dwight,"He's not coming back, it's over Michael."
Michael,Well...
Michael,No it's not.
Jan,I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Ex-client,No he's right.
Michael,What is that... word?
Dwight,"Accept it, why would he come back?"
Jan,"Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off."
Michael,"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us."
Michael,So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
Dwight,That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Jan,"Yes, Michael, they do."
Michael,"Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier."
Oscar,Creed?
Ex-client,"Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back."
Creed,"Yes, sir."
Michael,"Great, the magic of the gift basket."
Oscar,Everything OK?
Ex-client,That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.
Creed,"Everything's cool, dude."
Michael,"OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic."
Creed,"I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty."
GPS,Proceed straight.
Ryan,"Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here."
Dwight,"Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side."
Pam,Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
Michael,"I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing."
Ryan,Ohh... man.
Dwight,"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you."
Michael,"Good, we're all here, we can get started."
Michael,"That is a very good point, Dwight."
Ryan,Michael.
GPS,Make a right turn.
Michael,Have a seat.
Dwight,"Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there."
Ryan,We're not doing this today.
Michael,"No, it said right, it said take a right."
Michael,Have a seat. Like everybody else.
Dwight,"No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307."
Ryan,OK. This is...
Michael,Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
Michael,"Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did."
Dwight,It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Toby,"Technically, he's right."
Michael,The machine knows where it is going!
Michael,"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?"
Dwight,This is the lake!
Creed,Because they're lame.
Michael,The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
Michael,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like ""where's the Beef?"" Yeah."
Dwight,"No, it's--- there's no road here!"
Jim,"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot."
Dwight,"Remain calm! I have trained for this! Okay, exit the window! Here we go! Look out for leeches! Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! Michael! Michael!"
Pam,"Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too."
Michael,"Let go, let go of me!"
Michael,"I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone."
Dwight,"I got you, I got you!"
Pam,Oh.
Michael,You sure you're OK?
Robert Dunder,Michael Scott?
Dwight,Fine.
Michael,"That is me. Come on in. Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?"
Michael,"Good, that is what's most important."
Dwight,"Oh, yeah. Yes!"
Dwight,Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Robert Dunder,Thank you everyone.
Michael,"What a disaster, this whole thing."
Ryan,"Michael, can I talk to you a second?"
Dwight,I'll call a cab.
Michael,Sure thing. 'Scuse me.
Michael,"These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it."
Ryan,We have actual work to do.
Dwight,"Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone."
Michael,Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
Michael,"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. ""I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy"". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us."
Michael,"Bob, how old are you?"
Dwight,"Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake."
Robert Dunder,I'm 87.
Michael,Hang up. You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
Michael,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?"
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,"And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination."
Andy,Woo!
Michael,"Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time."
Jim,"There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it."
Dwight,Woo!
Jim,"A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge."
Pam,"I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!"
Andy,"After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams."
Pam,Ah-ha.
Michael,We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
Dwight,Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.
Andy,"Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on."
Andy,Dah! Come on!
Andy,Fifty-two reams!
Andy,"If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me."
Michael,Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
Dwight,No no no the first part.
Voice #1 on phone,Hey how'd it go?
Oscar,It's never gonna happen.
Andy,Dwight has defeated the computer.
Voice #2 on phone,"Yeah, what'd she say?"
Kevin,"Dude, you gotta believe."
Dwight,Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.
Andy,"I don't know yet, I have to call you back."
Michael,"Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?"
Angela,I didn't ask you to do it for me.
Voice #1 on phone,You have to give us something...
Jim,Wait for it.
Dwight,You didn't have to.
Andy,I'll call you back.
Michael,"Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a ""Where's Waldo."""
Angela,"How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?"
Angela,I have to go clean up after the party.
Everyone,Oh! Yes!
Angela,"Hello, Pam."
Michael,What a horrible day.
Michael,Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.
Pam,Hello.
Dwight,Blah.
Kevin,That was so awesome.
Angela,Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.
Michael,Bluh.
Michael,That was awesome. Thank you.
Pam,Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
Dwight,Uhh.
Michael,Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?
Angela,Let me know.
Michael,"Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?"
Meredith,Hey... there he is.
DunMiff/sys,You beat me. You are the superior being.
Dwight,What?
Jim,"Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?"
Michael,I'm going to get it.
Meredith,I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Dwight,Coopers has calamari.
Jim,"Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so..."
Michael,"Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi."
Meredith,"Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut."
Michael,Alright who wants to party?
Dwight,Tokyo?
Jim,Haha...
Oscar,Why aren't you in New York?
Michael,New York. Wanna go?
Meredith,"Anyway, I have this Sharpie..."
Michael,"Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out."
Dwight,Yes.
Jim,Uh-huh.
Stanley,You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Michael,"Alright, you drive."
Meredith,And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
Michael,I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Dwight,Okay.
Jim,MmmHmm...
Angela,Thank you.
Dwight,Nice.
Meredith,Can you write where I can read it?
Michael,Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?
Michael,Here we go.
Jim,Oh yeah.
Andy,He beat the computer.
Dwight,Woo-hoo.
Meredith,I'll read this when I get home.
Michael,Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
Michael,Mmm.
Jim,Alright...
Michael,"This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home."
Dwight,Yum.
Pam,Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Michael,How we doing on time?
Bartender,"I'm sorry, you guys are going to have to leave."
Michael,"Oh, does he?"
Angela,The party starts in an hour.
Michael,"Hey, you know what? Come on, come on, let's go."
Pam,He does.
Michael,Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Man,"Hey, you're the Scranton guy."
Michael,"Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you."
Angela,"Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?"
Michael,Guilty.
Jim,Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Michael,Mmmhmm.
Man,I liked your statement tonight.
Michael,And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
Angela,Something made of ice?
Michael,"Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer."
Michael,"Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen..."
Michael,Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.
Man,"Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that."
Michael,"The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6"
Angela,"Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?"
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Michael,"I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important..."
Man,See you later.
Jim,Actually it sounds like you are.
Angela,Chocolates? Someone famous?
Dwight,Later on.
Dwight,Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?
Michael,Yes
Michael,"I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face."
Kelly,"If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?"
Angela,Cool music.
Dwight,And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Michael,No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.
Michael,Uh...
Michael,"I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot."
Stanley,"Yes, please let us know."
Angela,Confetti.
Dwight,I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Dwight,"I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today."
Michael,I want it...
Michael,I made it with my cheese pita.
Angela,Waste of time.
Angela,Go-Go dancers?
Dwight,I date Indian girls.
Michael,"What's that, pipsqueak?"
Michael,"I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, ""Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"""
Michael,"I started a fire, I started a fire."
Angela,Waste of time. The website's going to win.
Angela,I can't do this.
Dwight,"Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss."
Dwight,You believe a computer can beat me?
Michael,Yes you can.
Michael,"And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody..."
Angela,"I don't care, but yes."
Angela,I can't do it.
Dwight,"I don't get that, I don't understand that."
Dwight,Well I will prove you wrong.
Michael,Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?
Michael,"Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh."
Angela,"I don't care, and you won't."
Angels,Okay. Okay.
Michael,Wanna head back?
Dwight,We'll see.
Michael,No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
Dwight,"Yeah, let's go."
Angela,"I won't be watching, and I won't."
Andy,What do you think of Angela?
Ryan,
Pam,Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Dwight,I think she's efficient.
Phyllis,"Stanley, you're dancing!"
Andy,"No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N."
Stanley,No I'm not.
Dwight,I hadn't noticed.
Ryan,"Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest."
Andy,You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
Voice of Thomas Dean,I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
Dwight,
Ryan,"Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun."
Andy,"I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right?"
Andy,And this is where I will record your sales.
Dwight,I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
Dwight,Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.
Andy,Isn't that part of the fun?
Andy,"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done."
Dwight,No. I think you should date Kelly.
Jim,Or zipadeedoodaah.
Andy,"She works here too, how is that any different?"
Andy,I can't tell if he's mocking me.
Dwight,"Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby."
Dwight,Just ignore him.
Andy,Okay.
Andy,"Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go."
Michael,Good news.
Jim,I was... mocking.
Stanley,We get to go home?
Andy,Thank you.
Michael,"Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?"
Dwight,I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
All,
Andy,Yes like a chime or a bell...
Kevin,Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Jim,Or a gong.
Michael,Same thing.
Dwight,Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.
Kevin,"No, no."
Andy,Yes!
All,
Kevin,Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Michael,You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Angela,Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you?
Kevin,"Oscar, talk to him."
Phyllis,"Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. So we're gonna try out some new things today."
Oscar,"Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?"
Phyllis,So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Michael,Pizza by Alfredo.
Angela,I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
All,
Phyllis,"I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful."
Michael,"Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?"
Angela,It is awful. You've made this day awful!
All,Medium amount of good pizza.
Kevin,Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Michael,
Angela,"Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?"
Kevin,"Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage."
Michael,"Ohh, lunch party."
Phyllis,You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
Angela,It's supposed to say launch!
Angela,It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
Michael,"Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway."
Phyllis,
Angela,I care!
Angela,Ow!
Angela,"Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead."
Phyllis,That seemed to shut her up.
Andy,Twenty seconds to go time.
Andy,Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box.
Dwight,Got it. Carb up.
Andy,"Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box."
Jim,Really? Power gel?
Andy,"Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?"
Dwight,"Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner."
Angela,What?
sAndy,Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this shot. Aaannnddd go!
Andy,Hello.
Dwight,"Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute."
Angela,"I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again."
Jim,What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
Andy,"They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates."
Dwight,Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Michael,Yup.
Jim,What?
Pam,The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
Pam,He's going through a break-up.
Michael,You don't have to say it like that.
Jim,"Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person."
Pam,I said it normal.
Andy,Yeah!
Michael,Hey
Dwight,"Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines."
Pizza guy,"Hey. Sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip."
Pam,What kind of prank are you thinking?
Michael,"Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty."
Dwight,What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.
Pizza guy,The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.
DunMiff/sys,Who am I?
Michael,"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas."
DwightKSchrute,You tell me.
Pizza guy,"I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy."
Jim,Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Michael,You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
DunMiff/sys,Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
Oscar,It's not pizza.
DwightKSchrute,How do I know this isn't Jim?
Michael,"Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon."
DunMiff/sys,What is a Jim?
Pizza guy,
Dwight,It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Michael,What do you mean hmm-um?
Michael,Okay.
Pizza guy,Not my problem.
Pam,Yes it's too tight.
Michael,"It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story."
Kelly,Waaay too tight.
Pizza guy,"Great story. It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip."
Michael,Really?
Michael,I'm not giving that to you.
Oscar,This is why I'm here?
Pizza guy,Well then you're not getting you're pizzas.
Kelly,Why is it so tight?
Michael,"No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out."
Michael,It's the European cut.
Pizza guy,What?
Angela,Is just looks bad.
Michael,"You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room."
Michael,"Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?"
Pizza guy,I'm not going in there.
Tech Guy,Setting up the web-cam for the party.
Michael,"Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you."
Michael,Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Pizza guy,This is stupid.
Kelly,Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Michael,"No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here."
Michael,"I had um, one of those danishes."
Stanley,You find anything?
Pam,Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Kevin,We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
Kelly,You had carbs? That's awful.
Oscar,"Stanley, could you look up ""accomplices""?"
Pam,"Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan."
Stanley,Why can't you guys do it?
Michael,Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.
Oscar,Because we're looking up jail time.
Jan,"My friends? Michael, I was terminated."
Stanley,Fine.
Michael,Just...
Dwight,I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Jan,Is it really that important to you?
Pizza guy,"Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed."
Michael,Yeah.
Michael,You ready to give me my discount now?
Jan,Alright.
Pizza guy,No.
Michael,Thank you.
Michael,"Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?"
Jan,Go by yourself.
Pizza guy,What kind of business is this?
Michael,Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
Dwight,We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Jan,Well...
Michael,"Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man."
Michael,Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
Pizza guy,You better think about what you're doing.
Jan,What? No Michael!
Michael,"No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?"
Michael,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
Pizza guy,Sales?
Dwight,Ohhhhhh!
Michael,"Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales."
Andy,Website check please.
Pizza guy,You're such a loser.
Meredith,Three hundred and five.
Dwight,What did you just call him?
Andy,Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.
Pizza guy,A loser.
Meredith,Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.
Dwight,What did you say?
Andy,You my friend are in a very close second.
Pizza guy,A loser.
Meredith,Four-oh-two.
Michael,"Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse."
Andy,"Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?"
Dwight,"I can make him talk, Michael."
Meredith,"What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve."
All,"Michael, Michael"
Michael,So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Michael,Stop talking all at once!
Jim,Sure we'll go.
Jim,You need to let him go.
Michael,Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Michael,Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Jim,Oh I'm sorry. What?
Jim,Yes.
Pam,One of the tickets is for him.
Michael,"You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions."
Michael,Just let me know who the winner is.
Jim,"Yes, but not by kidnapping."
Pam and Jim,Not it.
Michael,"I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want."
Jim,Nope.
Jim,As a hostage.
Pam,I won.
Michael,I think you're over-thinking it.
Jim,Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.
Jim,I think you're under-thinking it.
Pam,Tie goes to the girlfriend.
Michael,"Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our..."
Dwight,"No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh."
Jim,Ransom.
Jim,How's it going?
Michael,"Trouble. Okay, alright."
Dwight,Fine. Good.
Jim,What did he say?
Jim,Yeah?
Michael,He said no.
Dwight,Yeah.
Jim,"So, we should let him go."
Jim,You look a little worried.
Michael,"No, no."
Dwight,I do not look worried.
Jim,Okay.
DunMiff/sys,You do look worried.
Dwight,"Listen up kid. I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights."
DwightKSchrute,Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read...
Angela,I have to hang these.
Pam,"Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one."
Pizza guy,Why are you looking at her like that?
Jim,"Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper."
Dwight,Hey!
Angela,I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.
Kevin,What's going on?
Phyllis,I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
Jim,Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Angela,"Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?"
Michael,"Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?"
Phyllis,Yes.
Kevin,"We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end."
Angela,Goodie.
Angela,"I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour."
Jim,Hey man.
Meredith,I think it looks good.
Darryl,What's up man?
Angela,That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
Jim,What's going on?
Andy,"Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice."
Darryl,Make a delivery.
Angela,"How did you, um, where did you..."
Jim,Oh yeah?
Dwight,"It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor."
Darryl,Kelly ordered this online.
Angela,Will you help me put it over there?
Dwight,What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Andy,Yes I will.
Kelly,"But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, ""Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin."""
Angela,Okay.
Dwight,Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!
Andy,Excuse me.
Darryl,Who knows?
Andy,I stole it!
Dwight,Return it! Return it now!
Oscar,Thank God.
Darryl,Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
Pam,"Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself."
Dwight,"Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible."
Michael,I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Darryl,Who's it?
Jim,"Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?"
Darryl,Here you go.
Pam,I'm all over it.
Kelly,Thanks.
Jim,Okay.
Darryl,So you still missing Ryan?
Jim,What have we got here?
Kelly,Not so much anymore.
Kevin,Good pizza.
Darryl,Mmmmm.
Jim,"Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?"
Dwight,"I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them."
Kevin,Different stuff.
Dwight,"Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good."
Jim,Which one's this? Perfect.
Michael,Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
Jim,"Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?"
Jim,I'm driving?
Pam,"Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight."
Michael,Yes. Thank you.
Jim,And that's when I knew. You?
Jim,"Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam."
Pam,"You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired."
Michael,"Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. I love ya Pam... okay. I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?"
Jim,That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
Angela,Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
Pam,Yep.
Michael,"If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow."
Jim,"Wow, can we make it a different moment?"
Dwight,Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
Pam,Nope.
DunMiff/sys,Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.
Manager,Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.
Dwight,"I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?"
Ryan,"And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott."
Dwight,Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Michael,"Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take thathole."
Andy,No !
Ryan,Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.
Dwight,Huh?!
Pizza guy,"If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor."
Angela,Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
Angela,Ow! What are you doing?
Dwight,Did you see the board?
Andy,You said your upper back itched.
Angela,There's still an hour.
Angela,I didn't ask you to scratch it.
Michael,You ever read this?
Andy,"Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you."
Jim,"Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it."
Angela,I'm not dating you.
Michael,"Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured..."
Andy,"So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested."
Jim,Yeah.
Dwight,
Michael,Same sort of stuff in here.
Andy,"But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down."
Jim,It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.
Dwight,If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Michael,Mmwa. Mmwa.
Michael,"Hey, have you seen Jim?"
Jim,What was that?
Kevin,I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Michael,Leaving Pennsylvania.
Dwight,Ahh-chaa!
Jim,Oh. Two kisses.
Michael,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?"
Michael,One for me one for Jan.
Dwight,I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Jim,Gotcha.
Pizza guy,"I can hear you, man."
Michael,You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
Dwight,"Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!"
Jim,That would be fun.
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid."
Michael,Wanna come over Friday?
Dwight,"You had to, what other choice did you have?"
Jim,Uhhh. Can't.
Michael,I could have paid for the pizza.
Michael,After work you guys...
Dwight,"Well, yeah."
Jim,"Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?"
Michael,"Oh my God, oh my God."
Michael,"Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So..."
Michael,This is Michael.
Jim,Mmmkay...
Ryan,"Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out."
Michael,What are you doing?
Michael,You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Jim,"Uh, that is an invitation to an online party."
Ryan,Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his...
Michael,No.
Michael,"Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent."
Jim,Yep.
Dwight,What will you do?
Michael,"No, I'm sure that's not. Na..."
Michael,I will open the door.
Jim,"Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?"
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,Yes.
Michael,"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands."
Jim,Yep.
Dwight,"So, I'm paying full price?"
Michael,"Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan."
Michael,Yes.
Michael,You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
Dwight,"Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more."
Michael,Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Michael,"See ya, drive safely."
Jim,Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Michael,Okay.
Michael,Yeah. I withdrew too.
Dwight,Now what?
Andy,Four! Three! Two! One!
Michael,"Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens."
Dwight,Yes!
Dwight,"Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas."
Michael,Coat!
Ryan,What?
Pam,"Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow."
Michael,"It's whoever, not whomever."
Michael,Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
Ryan,"No, it's whomever."
Pam,"He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character."
Michael,"No, whomever is never actually right."
Michael,Get me Armani.
Jim,"No, sometimes its right."
Pam,A suit?
Creed,Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
Michael,On the phone.
Andy,"No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word."
Pam,Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
Oscar,"Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly."
Michael,Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.
Michael,Not a native speaker.
Michael,I owe you an apology.
Kevin,"I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night."
Pam,You finished the movie.
Ryan,Do you really know which one is correct?
Michael,Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
Kevin,I don't know.
Pam,No. Go ahead.
Pam,"It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject."
Michael,"Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle."
Phyllis,"Yeah, that sounds right."
Pam,Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
Michael,"Well it sounds right, but is it?"
Micahel,So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.
Stanley,How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Jan,You do.
Ryan,As an object.
Michael,I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
Kelly,Ryan used me an object.
Jan,"Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too."
Stanley,Is he right about that?
Michael,We already have a sofa. So why do---
Pam,How did he use it again?
Jan,A futon's not a sofa.
Toby,"It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object."
Michael,It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
Michael,Thank you.
Jan,"I know what a futon is, Michael."
Toby,"To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word."
Michael,I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
Michael,"No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull."
Jan,It costs what it costs.
Ryan,"Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here."
Michae,No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.
Michael,"I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history."
Jan,We have gone through this.
Michael,"Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---"
Michael,"Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise."
Mr. Figaro,Lipophedrine
Michael,It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs---
Michael,And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
Pam,"Michael, it's Ryan for you."
Mr. Figaro,Never heard of it.
Jan,Conniving little runt. Put him through.
Michael,"In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this."
Michael,"Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!"
Mr. Figaro,Are you quitting?
Ryan,I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Michael,I am.
Michael,"Yes, and thank you for sending that to me."
Mr. Figaro,"Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset."
Ryan,I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Michael,"I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night."
Michael,"Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up."
Andy,So.
Ryan,"Hold on, I'll get them on the phone."
Pam,What's up?
Michael,"Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it."
Andy,Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
Jim,"Sure, I can hold."
Pam,You're being gross.
Dwight,"Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!"
Andy,"Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves."
Jim,Hey Dwight.
Pam,What moves?
Dwight,"None of your business, Jim."
Andy,I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
Jim,Do you run the bed and breakfest?
Pam,I can't believe that's not working.
Dwight,It is not a B and B.
Andy,Yeah.
Dwight,"Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest."
Pam,"Um, I don't know if I really see you two together."
Jim,Does the Department of Health know about this?
Andy,"Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain."
Dwight,"I'm not telling you anything. Permits are pending. Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin."
Pam,She's very religious.
Pam,"Hello, I'm looking for a room."
Andy,"Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses."
Dwight,"Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones."
Pam,"Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe."
Pam,It says here you cater to the eldery.
Andy,"Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall."
Dwight,Where did you read that?
Pam,"That's right, you did."
Pam,Trip Advsior.
Andy,Yeah.
Dwight,"Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see."
Pam,"Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy."
Dwight,How many in your party?
Michael,"Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses."
Pam,Two?
Kevin,I do gamble Michael.
Dwight,"We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?"
Michael,"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?"
Jan,"So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight."
Kevin,The mob.
Michael,"Oh! Um, actually, I need the car."
Michael,Do you know anybody in the mob?
Jan,"Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?"
Kevin,
Michael,"Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her."
Michael,"Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary."
Dwight,"One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask."
Kelly,What do you mean you have plans tonight?
Angela,What about my cherub figurine?
Darryl,I have my daughter tonight
Dwight,You took that with you.
Kelly,"Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me."
Angela,"No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp."
Darryl,My daughter.
Dwight,"You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there."
Kelly,"Okay, I see how it is. Oops."
Angela,Fine.
Darryl,That was cold.
Dwight,"My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats."
Kelly,
Kevin,"The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?"
Phyllis,He's always been terrible with money.
Michael,"You can not, I have a thing tonight."
Stanley,I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Kevin,Dammit.
Kevin,"Yeah, women be shoppin'."
Jim,"Uh, Michael."
Meredith,I can't believe he has a second job.
Michael,What?
Oscar,He's not even good at his first one.
Jim,"That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight."
Michael,Hey guys.
Michael,"Oh no, I have a thing tonight."
Kevin,Shh.
Jim,Darn it!
Michael,"What'cha talking about? Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having s*x, what it looks like, I know, I think---"
Pam,Shoot!
Pam,Michael.
Michael,How about this weekend?
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey."
Jim,"No, can't."
Oscar,"Michael, are you having money problems?"
Pam,"We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you."
Michael,"Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?"
Michael,"Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right."
Oscar,You heard me correctly.
Jim,Where are you going out tonight?
Michael,"Oh, I hate monkeys."
Michael,You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
Pam,"What's going on, why do you have a second job?"
Jim,I wouldn't understand or a secret?
Michael,I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
Pam,"You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret."
Pam,Doesn't Jan have money?
Michael,"I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy."
Michael,"I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual."
Jim,"I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow."
Kevin,"True, it's best to hide our money problems from women."
Pam,The Beets Motel.
Michael,"I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?"
Jim,"The Beets Motel? That is, wow."
Oscar and Stanley,You just put it back in your pocket.
Pam,Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
Michael,"Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore."
Jim,How are you doing this?
Darryl,"Hey, let's call this what it is."
Pam,I don't know!
Darryl,It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Pam,Oh my gosh.
Kelly,"Well, I just need to know where this is going."
Michael,"I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing."
Darryl,"Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course."
Nick,What's going on here?
Kelly,"Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---"
Michael,"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call."
Darryl,"Slow down, think it over."
Nick,We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---
Kelly,"Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?"
Michael,"No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!"
Creed,"Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems."
Dwight,"We have three rooms, each with a different theme."
Michael,No you didn't.
Pam,What are the themes?
Creed,"Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away."
Dwight,"American, Irrigation, and Night-Time."
Creed,"Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider."
Pam,Irrigation.
Michael,"How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose."
Jim,Nice.
Creed,"You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up ""get out of jail free"" cards, those things cost thousands."
Dwight,"I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?"
Michael,That is a good point.
Jim,Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Creed,"Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate."
Dwight,No.
Michael,Like the witness protection program.
Jim,Not even Harry Potter?
Creed,Exactly.
Dwight,"No. Jim, come on."
Oscar,Not at all.
Mose,But you promised.
Michael,"I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life."
Dwight,"Mose, bags! Now!"
Michael,I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
Dwight,"Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty."
Oscar,"Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen."
Nick,Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.
Michael,"I didn't say it, I declared it."
Michael,These meetings are useless.
Oscar,"Still, that's not anything."
Nick,"I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?"
Oscar,This is a lot of credit card debt.
Michael,Very inspirational.
Michael,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Nick,We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.
Oscar,Mmm.
Co-Worker 1,Or a woman.
Michael,"You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine."
Michael,Or a trained seal.
Oscar,"Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon."
Nick,"You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok?"
Michael,"Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic."
Jim,"Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6."
Oscar,Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Pam,What?
Michael,"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core."
Jim,"Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight."
Andy,"I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game."
Jim,"You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less."
Oscar,"Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house."
Dwight,"Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!"
Michael,Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
Michael,"Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?"
Oscar,"The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that."
Stanely,"Yes, who is this?"
Michael,Right.
Michael,I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
Oscar,"This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment."
Stanely,Michael?
Michael,How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
Michael,...Stanley?
Pam,"Man, Angela really had a hold on him. Angela."
Stanley,Why are you calling me here at home?
Oscar,"Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy."
Michael,"Senor, are you happy with your---"
Michael,"No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this."
Stanley,"Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?"
Oscar,She has to know.
Michael,Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
Michael,"We will find another way, we'll ask power-point."
Stanley,"Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home?"
Oscar,"Michael, this is a presentation tool."
Stanley,"When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott."
Michael,You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
Michael,Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
Oscar,I'm done!
Nick,My office.
Michael,"No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half."
Michael,You bet.
Oscar,Jan is smart.
Nick,"Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation."
Michael,She poses.
Michael,"Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---"
Jim,"Dwight, how's the hotel business?"
Nick,A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
Dwight,Stupid.
Michael,It is not a waste of our time.
Jim,Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
Nick,This is a trading game.
Dwight,No.
Micael,No.
Jim,Maybe you should.
Nick,You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.
Dwight,Maybe you should. Whatever.
Michael,Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
Pam,"We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times."
Nick,"Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night."
Jim,The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Michael,"Well, I hope this conversation has helped."
Pam,Table making never seemed so possible.
Dwight,"And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. ""Harry?"" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing."
Jim,You will never want to leave your room.
Michael,What did you get tonight?
Pam,The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
Vikram,"Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice."
Dwight,I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
Michael,"Oh, that looks good."
Pam,We really did. It was fun.
Vikram,"Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?"
Oscar,"So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt."
Michael,I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
Jan,You're broke?
Vikram,Enjoy.
Michael,"Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?"
Michael,Thank you.
Jan,"Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say."
Vikram,I was a surgeon back home.
Oscar,Jan.
Michael,Really?
Jan,"Yeah, what?"
Vikram,Oh yeah.
Oscar,Michael left.
Michael,Wonder what I would've been back home?
Jan,"Okay, where did he go?"
Vikram,Well this is your home.
Oscar,I don't know.
Michael,"I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something."
Jan,"Well, is he coming right back?"
Vikram,"Uhh, no."
Oscar,I don't think so.
Michael,I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
Jan,I'll be right there.
Jim,"Wait, you're going up there?"
Michael,"What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good."
Pam,Yeah. Coward.
Angela,"You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood."
Pam,Oh my God. What century is this?
Pam,Dwight.
Michael,"You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator."
Dwight,Uhh-mmm
Co-Worker 2,"Dude, you should review movies."
Jim,Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Michael,I actually wrote a movie.
Dwight,No you didn't.
Co-Worker 3,Really?
Jim,"Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam."
Michael,"I'm writing one, yeah."
Dwight,Mmm-uh-mm
Co-Worker 3,What's it about?
Jim,"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you."
Michael,"Um, sort of a spy, thriller..."
Dwight,
Nick,"What's so captivating? I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking."
Pam,"Hey, I was thinking about dinner---"
Pam,"Ugh, your turn."
Jim,"Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be."
Dwight,Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
Pam,Okay.
Jim,Hey Dwight.
Jim,Yeah?
Dwight,"Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,Does Mose have nightmares?
Jim,Okay.
Jim,Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Pam,Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
Dwight,Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
Jim,"Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food."
Jim,"Yeah, yeah."
Oscar,"Jan, he went running that way."
Dwight,Great.
Jan,Alright.
Jim,"Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here."
Michael,"Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back."
Dwight,Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Jan,Michael.
Jim,"Good night, Dwight."
Michael,Hey Jan.
Co-Worker 2,"Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?"
Jan,What's going on?
Co-Worker 3,"We'd love for you to come, Michael."
Michael,"Not much, what's up with you?"
Michael,"Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning."
Jan,"Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?"
Co-Worker 2,"All right, next time dude."
Michael,I'm out of answers Jan.
Michael,"Okay, see you guys. Hey, how you doin'?"
Jan,What does that mean?
Jan,"You drive, I had too much wine."
Michael,"I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you."
Michael,Okay. How's yoga?
Jan,"Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that."
Jan,I didn't go.
Michael,I don't know that.
Michael,Wh-Why not?
Jan,"Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically."
Jan,I just didn't!
Michael,I'll stay off the grid.
Michael,Okay.
Jan,"Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad."
Jan,How was improv?
Michael,"Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up."
Michael,Good night Vikram.
Jan,"Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen."
Vikram,Good night.
Michael,That's really nice of you to say.
Michael,"Hey, congrats on the bonus."
Jan,"Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?"
Vikram,Thank you Michael.
Michael,I think the engineer left.
Michael,I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
Dwight,"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now."
Vikram,"Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah."
Michael,Don't sell your implants please.
Michael,Good night.
Jan,I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Vikram,Good night.
Michael,That's nice though.
Pam,"Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?"
Jan,It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Dwight,Pam.
Michael,It looks cute though.
Jim,You okay?
Dwight,I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.
Ryan,Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
Ryan,"Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?"
Michael,Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
Ryan,"Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott."
Michael,"Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!"
Michael,"Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery."
Michael,"And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes."
Ryan,Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
Michael,Why?
Ryan,"You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?"
Michael,"No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that."
Ryan,I'm your boss.
Michael,"My other boss, Mr. Figaro."
Ryan,You have another job?
Michael,What I do between 5
Jim,Are you a cocktail waitress?
Ryan,You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Michael,It won't.
Ryan,"It did, all ready."
Michael,"Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways."
Kelly,You're so funny.
Ryan,Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Kelly,I invited him.
Ryan,"It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need."
Darryl,"There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this."
Kelly,Okay.
Darryl,"Hey, get off."
Kelly,"Umm, see you later tonight."
Darryl,I have plans later.
Kelly,"Okay, bye honey."
Ryan,How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Michael,"Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?"
Ryan,"You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever."
Michael,"Huh, okay."
Michael,"Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!"
Phyllis,Dancing babies!
Michael,Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
Michael,"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby."
Andy,"Best ad ever. Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?"
Jim,Nobody tell him!
Andy,"What? No, why?"
Jim,"You got it, you're so close!"
Andy,Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Jim,"Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think..."
Andy,Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
Jim,Nope.
Andy,Football cream. Grr!
Michael,"Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?"
Pam,I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Michael,"Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good."
Michael,Hello hello!
Ad guy 1,"Hey, how ya doin'?"
Michael,Michael Scott.
Ad guy 2,"Hey, Michael."
Michael,Regional manager.
Ad guy 2,"Hey Michael, nice to meet you"
Michael,Excited to talk ideas.
Ad guy 1,"Let's do it, man."
Michael,"You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing."
Ad guy 1,That sounds great.
Michael,"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with."
Michael,I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
Andy,Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
Michael,He gives the best back rubs in the office.
Andy,"It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!"
Michael,Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
Stanley,Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
Michael,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
Michael,"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun."
Kevin,Mama Bear!
Michael,Who else?
Jim,"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide."
Jim,You playing that game again?
Dwight,"Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers."
Jim,Oh it has losers.
Dwight,I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.
Michael,"Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further---"
Ad guy 1,Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---
Michael,"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so..."
Ad guy 1,"That all sounds really, really ambitious."
Michael,"Yeah, I know."
Ad guy 1,Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
Michael,Mmm. Okay.
Michael,That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! Whoa.
Ad guy 1,That's what we came up with.
Michael,Well we can do better than that.
Ad guy 2,"Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually."
Ad guy 1,"Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway."
Michael,The waving?
Ad guy 1,"Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative."
Andy,"I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?"
Dwight,"We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us."
Andy,We'll use code names.
Dwight,"Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight."
Andy,That's not different enough.
Dwight,Dwike?
Receptionist,You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
Ryan,Hello?
Michael,"Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry."
Ryan,What?
Michael,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem."
Ryan,I told you not to call about small problems.
Michael,"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas."
Ryan,"That's good. They're creative, you're not."
Michael,"I'm creative, Ryan."
Ryan,"It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant."
Michael,"Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store."
Ryan,"Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?"
Michael,Yeah!
Ryan,But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Michael,"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity."
Michael,"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet."
Michael,"Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today."
Ad guy 2,"Okay, when should we come back?"
Michael,"How about never hundred hours, sir."
Ad guy 2,We were sent here to help out.
Ad guy 1,Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude.
Michael,Hey thanks. Thank you.
David Wallace,"Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people?"
Michael,"Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again."
Ryan,I'm on Michael.
Michael,"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime."
David Wallace,This is weird.
Michael,I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
David Wallace,"Okay, I'll see it tomorrow."
Michael,"Okay. And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way."
Michael,"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, ""You're not creative""?"
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,"Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with."
Jim,"Who are you talking to, specifically?"
Kevin,I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man.
Oscar,When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
Meredith,"I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around."
Michael,"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area."
Phyllis,Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
Michael,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer."
Phyllis,Okay.
Andy,"Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?"
Creed,She's crazy hot.
Andy,Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
Angela,That's not happening.
Angela,I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
Phyllis,Bye everyone.
Michael,Line it up Phyllis.
Creed,Get her Phyll.
Darryl,"Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain."
"Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Darryl","Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs."
Darryl,Dunder Mifflin.
"Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly",The people person's paper people.
Darryl,Dunder Mifflin.
"Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly",The people person's paper people.
Michael,"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap."
Darryl,What's rap?
Michael,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix."
Darryl,Great.
Andy,News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,"No talk, I'm animating."
Jim,"Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality."
Pam,Are you serious?
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,"Oh my God, he's really in pain."
Jim,
Pam,Who's that?
Jim,"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever."
Pam,He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Jim,"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---"
Pam,Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
Jim,Yep.
Pam,You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
Jim,I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Pam,"No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim."
Jim,"Ah, show me how this works."
Pam,Oh boy.
Darryl,"Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin."
"Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly",The people person's paper people.
Darryl,Dunder Mifflin.
"Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly",The people person's paper people.
Michael,Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
Darryl,"You're right, it's better than you! It's us! Dunder Mifflin."
"Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly",The people person's paper people.
Michael,"No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible."
Darryl,"You're on your own, Mike."
Michael,"Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl."
Darryl,You just said you hated it.
Michael,"No. I said I hate the, the style."
Andy,Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Michael,"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible."
Andy,Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Michael,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?"
Phyllis,"Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer."
Michael,That'a girl.
Phyllis,So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Michael,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?"
Phyllis,No.
Michael,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?"
Jim,"I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one."
Pam,"Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet."
Jim,Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Pam,"No no, you can go home. I'm good."
Jim,"Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home."
Meredith,You comin'?
Jim,"I, ah..."
Meredith,Piss or get off the pot!
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
Jim,"Good morning. Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns."
Pam,Thank you.
Jim,You're welcome.
Pam,I worked until about 2
Andy,Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
Dwight,"Andy, I can't hear this right now."
Andy,"No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, ""Oh D, oh D."""
Dwight,She called you D?
Andy,Yeah. D for Andy.
Dwight,Oh D.
Andy,Oh D.
Dwight,Oh D.
Andy,Oh D!
Both,Ohhhhhh D! Ohhhh D!
Michael,I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.
Pam,Yes?
Michael,"Pam, please clear my phone lines."
Pam,"Certainly. Okay, clear."
Michael,They could call at any second now. Oh God...I better call.
Michael,"Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!"
Everyone,Oh!
Bartender,Hey it seemed like a big hit.
Michael,"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real."
Jim,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?"
Jim,"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it."
Michael's Ad,"It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world. And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time, and bad news isn't always what it seems. Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. To score. [Jim throws paper in basket, Michael retrieves it"
Everyone,
Jim,Animation? All her by the way.
Bartender,Really?
Jim,I just thought you should---
Bartender,The animation was cool.
Pam,Thanks.
Bartender,"Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?"
Jim,Ahh.
Kevin,"Michael, that was fun."
Michael,"That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!"
Andy,"Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. It's gotta rhyme with ""piece."" Fancy Feast! Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it."
Rolando,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call."
Karen,"So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?"
Karen,Yeah.
Jim,"Yeah, trying to quit though."
Rolando,Karen? He's on line one.
Karen,"If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult."
Karen,"Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton?"
Jim,"Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you..."
Karen,I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Karen,
Karen,"Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye."
Jim,"I mean, it's just that- You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you..."
Karen,"Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?"
Karen,"Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you."
Michael,This is perfect.
Jim,"Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic."
Dwight,He looks like your twin.
Karen,"Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm."
Michael,"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone."
Jim,I... will...
Dwight,I will know.
Michael,"We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad."
Michael,"But, you will not tell anyone."
Michael,"Um, wanted"
Dwight,I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.
Stanley,Michael? A word?
Michael,"Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?"
Michael,Of course.
Stanley,I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Stanley,"I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job."
Michael,"Just go out, and come back in."
Michael,Really?
Stanley,"I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it."
Stanley,"I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? Sometimes I say crazy things."
Michael,What?
Jim,Hey.
Michael,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there."
Pam,"I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility."
All,
Jim,Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Michael,"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her."
Pam,
Jim,"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening."
Andy,"Oh-oh, come on!"
Michael,"Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?"
Jim,"Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I."
Stanley,I think it's because of my sales record.
Oscar,"Okay, did you get it out of your system."
Michael,That could not possibly be it.
Jim,"Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read."
Michael,"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming."
Toby,Fun?
Michael,How can I get you to stay?
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Stanley,Money.
Toby,Really?
Michael,"Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving."
Jim,Yeah.
Stanley,Money.
Toby,What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins?
Michael,"Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-"
Jim,"No, that wasn't fun."
Stanley,Money.
Toby,Did you even read it?
Michael,"Pssh, kay."
Jim,Of course I read it.
Pam,"Oscar, did you bring it?"
Oscar,How does it end?
Oscar,To be Edwardian. His best work.
Toby,Who was the main character?
Pam,"Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware."
Jim,Angela. Nope. The ashes.
Oscar,"Sure thing Pam, can't wait."
Pam,
Pam,"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive."
Oscar,"Besides having s*x with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me."
Jim,So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
Pam,Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Jim,Oscar?
Pam,Some people.
Karen,Hello?
Michael,"Fillipellers, how's it hanging?"
Karen,Michael...
Michael,To the left?
Karen,"Listen, I-"
Michael,To the right?
Karen,I'm-
Michael,"Okay, enough small talk, go ahead."
Karen,You called me.
Michael,"Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this."
Karen,I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Michael,"No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby."
Karen,Toby's not a salesperson.
Michael,"You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours."
Karen,Oooh. Good-bye Michael.
Michael,"Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?"
Pam,"I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica."
Michael,"Hi Ben, Michael Scott."
Ben,Hi Michael.
Michael,"I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend."
Ben,Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
Pam,
Michael,"Get out. Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby."
Ben,"Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?"
Michael,"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?"
Ben,Seriously?
Michael,"What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House."
Dwight,Found him!
Michael,"Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it."
Jim,So what are you going to do?
Michael,"What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples."
Jim,Did they?
Michael,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?"
Pam,"It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things."
Michael,"That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words."
Jim,We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
Michael,What? What? We did?
Dwight and Michael,"Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
Michael,Look at his face! Look at his face!
Jim,What are we doing?
Dwight,"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah."
Michael,"What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?"
Dwight,"Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today."
Michael,"We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing."
Jim,We're going to Utica?
Michael,Uh-huh.
Jim,I'm not going to Utica right now.
Michael,"Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim."
Jim,No.
Michael,We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
Michael and Dwight,Utica! Utica! Utica!
Michael and Dwight,Utica! Utica!
Michael,In your face
Dwight,Yow!
Jim,I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Michael,Are you calling Karen?
Jim,"No, I'm not calling Karen."
Dwight,He's lying.
Michael,"Yep, get it."
Jim,"What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!"
Dwight,Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Jim,Are you kidding me?
Dwight,No communication with the outside world Jim.
Michael,"It had to be done, it had to be done."
Jim,"Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so..."
Dwight,"Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot."
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"Hey Dwight, he found it."
Jim,You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Michael,"Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever."
Jim,"Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?"
Michael,Do you really wanna know?
Jim,"Oh, God."
Michael,"Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs."
Dwight,Or real bombs.
Michael,"No, no, not real bombs."
Dwight,"Yeah, come on, it will be so badass."
Michael,"Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know."
Jim,No.
Michael,"It could be badass. Yeah, it will."
Jim,"No, no absolutely we are not doing this."
Dwight,"Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass."
Jim,Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Michael,Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
Jim,"So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache."
Michael,"So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the s*x?"
Jim,What?
Michael,"I can't imagine the s*x being bad, I mean her body is..."
Jim,"Okay, you know what?"
Michael,...awesome.
Jim,Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Michael,"Okay, I will start. Um, ""A."" ""A"" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um..."
Jim,It doesn't matter.
Michael,I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Jim,Doesn't matter.
Michael,"Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something?"
Jim,"That doesn't make sense, couldn't be."
Michael,"What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?"
Dwight,I'm peeing in this empty can.
Jim,Oh my God!
Michael,"Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!"
Dwight,"Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go."
Jim,"Michael, watch the road!"
Dwight,"Hey, you're making me spray!"
Michael,I'll kill you man!
Jim,"Michael! Michael, pull over!"
Michael,That is just so disgusting!
Jim,"Pull over, pull over!"
Dwight,I think I cut my pen1s on the lid!
Oscar,Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
Toby,"I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic."
Pam,"And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?"
Andy,"Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit."
Oscar,What are you doing?
Andy,"Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam."
Pam,"Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club."
Andy,"The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety."
Andy,"Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading."
Toby,"Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club."
Andy,Why can't I be in the club?
Jim,"I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening."
Dwight,Believe it.
Michael,"Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?"
Jim,"No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car."
Michael,"Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-"
Jim,Guy's going by. Shh.
Michael,You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
Dwight,"And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk."
Jim,"No, no, you won't do that. Nope."
Dwight,Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Jim,"Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?"
Dwight,"Okay, Jim."
Jim,"Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go."
Dwight,"Let's move! Move, move, move, move!"
Jim,"Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done."
Pam,"I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention."
Kevin,Damn it!
Pam,"It just- To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh..."
Oscar,Yes.
Kevin,Damn it!
Pam,Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Oscar,Very brave.
Pam,"Very brave choice also, I thought."
Oscar,"And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um... What are you microwaving!?"
Phyllis,Popcorn.
Pam,"Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?"
Phyllis,Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn.
Andy,"So, Stanley, are you really outta here?"
Stanley,"Yep, looks that way."
Andy,"I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch."
Michael,We are in a stairwell.
Dwight,We are climbing some stairs.
Dwight,I'm breathing heavily.
Jim,"Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me."
Dwight,Well...
Michael,"There's a guy, there's a guy."
Dwight,"There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?"
Michael,"Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close."
Dwight,I can see the security guard's eyes.
Jim,"No, no, don't do anything to them."
Dwight,I have to do something to his eyes.
Dwight,The eyes are the groin of the head.
Jim,"Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home."
Michael,"We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier."
Jim,Isn't that thing huge?
Michael,"It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running."
Jim,"No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this."
Michael,Aha!
Dwight,My hip bone!
Michael,"We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us."
Dwight,Don't leave us!
Michael,Save yourself!
Dwight,"Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!"
Jim,"Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-"
Michael,"Dwight, you gotta move!"
Jim,Damn it guys!
Michael,"Dwight, could you move over a little bit."
Dwight,I'm losing control of my bladder.
Jim,"Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!"
Dwight,Did you say Karen?
Michael,"Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim."
Jim,"No, I'm not doing that."
Michael,Just say you wanna get back together.
Jim,"No, I'm not doing that!"
Michael,"It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies."
Karen,Jim?
Jim,Hey Karen.
Karen,"Uh, what are you doing here?"
Jim,"First of all, hi."
Karen,What are you doing here?
Jim,"You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so..."
Dwight,Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Jim,Copy that.
Karen,"I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good."
Karen,"Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?"
Dwight,"Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people."
Karen,I'm taking Stanley.
Dwight,Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Michael,"Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground."
Karen,"Jim, hang on a second?"
Jim,Yes?
Toby,"I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did."
Meredith,I love camping. Anything can happen.
Toby,"Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat."
Michael,Morning.
Toby,Michael.
Pam,"Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a ""get to know you"" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him."
Pam,Did you sleep in cabins?
Toby,"Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come."
Phyllis,Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once.
Phyllis,"Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited."
Pam,Who went?
Toby,"Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, ""No more s'mores, no more s'mores."""
Toby,"Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience"
Michael,"Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up."
Toby,Michael wasn't invited.
Michael,"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? Not real."
Jim,Got it.
Michael,"So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?"
Jim,"Absolutely, yes."
Jim,"When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes."
Michael,Really?
Jim,Yeah?
Michael,"Oh, you wanna go today?"
Jim,And I am always busy.
Jim,"Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood."
Michael,How often can you actually donate blood?
Jim,Is there a limit?
Michael,Your body only has a certain amount.
Jim,"Well, is that it? Or?"
Michael,"Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame."
Jim,How so?
Michael,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores?"
Jim,What's that?
Michael,"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---"
Jim,Right.
Michael,"In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change."
Jim,Not gonna change.
Michael,"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos."
Jim,I thought we had that looked at.
Michael,I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
Michael,"When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called ""Survivorman."" And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed."
Michael,"OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife."
Dwight,I'm on it.
Michael,"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. Hey, what..."
Dwight,Let's see if any of these will work.
Michael,"Hey, hey hey! Dwight.. Dwight."
Dwight,"I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, ""Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place."" Well I say, ""It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."""
Michael,"Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day."
Pam,Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Michael,No.
Pam,Great.
Michael,Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Pam,Oh.
Michael,Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
Jim,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?"
Michael,"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me."
Jim,"OK, great."
Michael,"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I."
Jim,Yup.
Michael,"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being."
Jim,That'd be great.
Dwight,Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way
Michael,"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead."
Dwight,"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape."
Michael,"Well, yes I would. And I would survive."
Dwight,I would make sure that you were dead.
Michael,Well...
Dwight,"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified."
Michael,You...
Dwight,And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Michael,You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. OK.
Dwight,What are you doing?
Michael,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- Ow! What are you doing?"
Dwight,It would be better if you were unconscious.
Michael,"No! Gosh! Dwight. Stop it, stop it! Stop it."
Dwight,Do you want to do this right or not?
Michael,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?"
Angela,"Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday."
Jim,"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?"
Angela,"Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?"
Jim,"I do remember, yeah."
Angela,It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
Jim,"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?"
Angela,What?
Jim,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are."
Michael,Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
Jim,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to ""Happy Birthday."" And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault."
Michael,Happy Birthday!
Kelly,Ahhh!!
Michael,Happy Birthday!
Oscar,Ahhh!
Michael,Happy Birthday!
Phyllis,Oh!
Jim,"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive."
Jim,"We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time."
Angela,I don't like it.
Pam,"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?"
Jim,"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?"
Pam,Do you think it's a good idea?
Jim,No... I think it's a great idea.
Pam,Hmm.
Dwight,We're here.
Michael,Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
Dwight,Here we go. Just the two of us
Dwight,"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?"
Dwight,"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it."
Jim,"You know, try sending them another invoice."
Oscar,Ok.
Jim,"Alright. Oh, did you see my memo by the way?"
Oscar,"""Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today."" This is really cool."
Jim,Right? I was just thinking...
Oscar,"No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun."
Jim,Right! Exactly. Knew I could count on you.
Dwight,Good a spot as any.
Michael,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --"
Dwight,I'm just --
Michael,Stop.
Dwight,Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. Behold.
Michael,"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight."
Dwight,Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
Michael,"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK."
Dwight,"Good luck, Michael."
Michael,"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight."
Meredith,"Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?"
Jim,What's that?
Meredith,I really prefer devils food cake.
Jim,"Oh, sure."
Meredith,Yes!
Jim,OK.
Pam,Wow! That was easy.
Jim,"Yeah, people like me I guess."
Creed,Jim.
Creed,I hate devils food.
Jim,Well I think Meredith was just --
Creed,"Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday."
Jim,Everybody's birthday.
Creed,Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Jim,What do you want?
Creed,I want pie. I want peach pie.
Jim,You want a birthday pie?
Creed,I want a nice cobbler.
Jim,"Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie."
Creed,I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Jim,It will be Angela.
Creed,You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
Michael,"Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here..."
Dwight,"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity."
Michael,"There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts."
Michael,I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.
Michael,"See, this is a beautiful piece of material This could be used for all sorts of things."
Michael,Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
Andy,Tuna.
Jim,Andy.
Andy,"Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale."
Jim,Not your birthday.
Andy,"Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale."
Jim,"Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no."
Andy,"Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up."
Jim,"Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make."
Andy,Loud and clear.
Jim,Alright.
Andy,Pizza rolls.
Jim,"OK, I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work. So I will be in here."
Andy,Mushroom caps.
Michael,"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter."
Dwight,Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. I hope he finds it. Lunch.
Michael,"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious."
Dwight,About two more minutes.
Michael,"I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy."
Meredith,"What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?"
Kevin,"Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break."
Stanley,"I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die."
Oscar,Why don't you just have an apple?
Stanley,Why don't you mind your business?
Creed,"Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care."
Oscar,Probably went to his head.
Creed,Yeah.
Oscar,"Hey, Jim."
Jim,"Hey guys, what're we talking about?"
Creed,Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
Michael,"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day."
Dwight,Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on.
Toby,Hey Jim.
Jim,Toby.
Toby,"Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea."
Jim,"Oh, thanks man."
Toby,Yeah...
Jim,Is there anything --
Toby,My birthday was two months ago.
Jim,"Oh, OK."
Toby,There was no party.
Jim,What?
Toby,"Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4"
Jim,I remember that.
Toby,"I don't know, I just thought you could include me."
Jim,Seriously?
Toby,I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that.
Jim,"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon."
Jim,"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?"
Angela,"No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps."
Toby,I'm allergic to mushrooms.
Jim,"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing."
Pam,Conference room?
Jim,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it."
Angela,What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Kevin,"Oh, I'll take 'em."
Creed,Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
Phyllis,"Hey, Michael. I mean Jim."
Jim,"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact."
Michael,"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well."
Dwight,"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out."
Everybody,Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you.
Michael,"Yeah! Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something."
Michael,"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky."
Michael,"Hey, buddy."
Jim,Hey.
Michael,What up?
Jim,Sure glad you're back.
Michael,You are relieved.
Jim,You have no idea.
Michael,So what did I miss?
Jim,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once."
Michael,Oh.
Jim,"So, terrible idea."
Michael,"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake."
Jim,You did do it?
Michael,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out."
Jim,"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years."
Michael,That's what I said. That's what she said.
Jim,That's what who said?
Michael,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard."
Jim,That's what she said.
Michael,"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward."
Oscar,"So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again-"
Michael,I'll call back.
Kevin,You never call back.
Pam,"Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes."
Michael,"Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back."
Jan,
Michael,You can't always work 200 days though.
Michael,"Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting."
Ryan,You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Michael,Yep.
Ryan,I can get you a tutor if you need-
Michael,"Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later."
Ryan,"Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call."
Michael,"N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude."
Ryan,"Take the call, friend."
Michael,"I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist."
Ryan,I insist you take your work calls.
Michael,"Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? Hi buddy."
Jan,"I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club."
Michael,"Yeah, I hate that."
Jan,Good.
Michael,"So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs."
Jan,And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Michael,"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy."
Jan,"Um, no, I want it up. My hair."
Michael,Well-
Jan,"Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior."
Michael,Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Jan,Does this work for you?
Michael,Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
Jan,"Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky."
Michael,Million dollars!
Jan,Four million.
Michael,"Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized."
Jan,"No, Michael. Oh, come on."
Michael,Perfect crime.
Jan,"Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment."
Michael,"Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good."
Jan,"Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down."
Michael,"I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up."
Jan,"All right, fine, just a second. Hold on."
Michael,"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?"
Lester,A good start. And I think it's busload.
Michael,"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is."
Ryan,Hey Michael.
Michael,Hey hey.
Ryan,I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Ryan,Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Michael,I would love that.
Ryan,"Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?"
Michael,Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
Ryan,Good. That is great to hear.
Michael,It is.
Darryl,"Game, son!"
Jim,"All right, let's run it back."
Pam,The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Kelly,What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
Pam,"Hi, Kelly."
Kelly,Guess whose boyfriend it is?
Pam,I don't wanna guess.
Kelly,I'll give you a hint
Kelly,"I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like"
Pam,Jim. Can I see you for a second?
Jim,Sure.
Jim,Wow.
Pam,"Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl."
Jim,"Oh, I can't beat Darryl."
Pam,Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Jim,"What, seriously? What is she saying?"
Kelly,"Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball."
Kelly,Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
Kelly,Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
Jim,So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
Pam,"Sorta, yes."
Jim,Bring me players.
Pam,Okay.
Diane Kelly,"Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel."
Michael,"Hi. No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?"
Diane,Toby?
Michael,"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?"
Toby,"Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side."
Michael,Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
Jan,"Michael, just relax, okay?"
Diane,"You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So.."
Michael,Okay. All right.
Deposition Reporter,"Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
Michael,Yessh.
Lester,"Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination?"
Michael,"Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior."
Lester,Oh. Very good. Well put.
Jan,People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
Pam,"Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you."
Kevin,About what?
Pam,He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
Kevin,Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Pam,"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room."
Kevin,"Oh, awesome!"
Lester,How long have you known the plaintiff?
Michael,"I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief"
Lester,How long have you known Ms. Levinson?
Michael,Six years and two months.
Lester,And you were directly under her the entire time?
Michael,That's what she said.
Lester,Excuse me?
Michael,That's what she said.
Lester,Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?
Michael,"Uh, wh-why would she say that?"
Jan,Can we just move on to another question?
Diane,"No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?"
Lester,"With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position."
Michael,Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Jan,"Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?"
Lester,"Oh, are you sure?"
Jan,"Uh, yes."
Lester,Can you go back to where this digression began?
Deposition Reporter,Mr. Schneider
Michael,"Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it."
Kelly,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
Lester,Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?
Michael,She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
Lester,Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?
Michael,"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk."
Lester,You don't need to go any further. Her breasts.
Michael,Yes.
Lester,She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?
Michael,"Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant."
Lester,What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?
Michael,"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules."
Lester,Interesting. How so?
Michael,"Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here."
Diane,"Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?"
Michael,I will allow it.
Diane,"Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please."
Michael,Uh...
Diane,"That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?"
Michael,Uh-huh.
Diane,"And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?"
Michael,"Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define ""begin"". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago."
Diane,"Wait, excuse me?"
Michael,"If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that."
Lester,Could we take a short break?
Diane,"No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?"
Michael,Line.
Diane,"I'm sorry, what?"
Man,"He asked for a line, like in a play."
Deposition Reporter,"""Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?"" ""I did?"" ""Yes you did."" ""Can I go to the bathroom?"" ""No."" ""I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water."" ""You went five minutes ago."" ""That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question."" ""You still have to answer it."" ""First can I go to the bathroom?"" ""No."""
Jim,Good game Meredith.
Meredith,Don't patronize me.
Dwight,All right! What is going on here?
Jim,"Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?"
Jim,What the hell?
Dwight,I told you.
Dwight,"All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, JÃ¶rg RoÃŸkopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba."
Michael,"Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition."
Diane Kelly,"Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know."
Lester,"Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal."
Michael,Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Lester,"This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. ""Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had s*x with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had s*x six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie."""
Michael,Irie.
Lester,"Irie, sorry. ""More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael."" It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?"
Diane Kelly,We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
Michael,I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
Diane Kelly,It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
Man,"OK, let's make ten copies of this diary."
Toby,"Um, can you make it eleven?"
Man,"Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look."
Michael,Can I sit here?
Toby,"...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted..."
Michael,How can you give up my diary like that?
Jan,"I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this."
Michael,How'd you even find it?
Jan,You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Michael,I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
Jan,"Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even."
Michael,Fine. I love you.
Jan,I love you too.
Diane Kelly,"Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as ""Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."""
Michael,"Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend."
Lester,Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person.
Toby,Excuse me.
Michael,"Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had s*x with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful."
Diane Kelly,"OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you."
Michael,Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Diane Kelly,Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
Michael,"That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... ...of water."
Diane Kelly,"Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please?"
Michael,March 17th.
Diane Kelly,"And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?"
Michael,Yes.
Diane Kelly,"You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to."
Michael,"""I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."""
Diane Kelly,"Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?"
Michael,
Diane Kelly,Mr. Scott?
Pam,How's it going?
Dwight,"Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable."
Jim,"Check this out though, spin serve. Well, it works like 80% of the time, so..."
Pam,"Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?"
Jim,I think I'm ready.
Pam,I'll make the call.
Dwight,"Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass."
Jim,...Right. Spin-serve!
Michael,How can you do that to me?
Jan,
Lester,"You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record."
Jan,"Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy."
Michael,"Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it."
Jan,"Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition."
Lester,Starting at paragraph 6. Council
Michael,See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Lester,Council
Council,"""Was he in the top 5 of contenders?"" David Wallace"
Lester,"I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?"
Michael,...Absolutely not.
Pam,Yes! Way to go. See that?
Kelly,"Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point."
Darryl,"19, serving 4."
Kelly,"Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!"
Pam,"You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!"
Kelly,What?
Pam,Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
Kelly,OK. Bring it on.
Pam,I am.
Kelly,Think you can handle this?
Pam,In my sleep.
Kelly,"OK. Volley for serve, P."
Pam,O. P.
Kelly,O.
Jim,Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
Darryl,Yes.
David,Michael. I am very sorry.
Michael,"Oh, hey no biggie. Just..."
David Wallace,"No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry."
Michael,"Hey, David?"
David,Yeah?
Michael,I think you're a nice guy too.
David,"Thanks, Michael."
Michael,"Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend."
Michael,What do you want to do for dinner?
Jan,How about Chinese?
Michael,Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Jan,That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Michael,Do you fast food?
Jan,"Fine, fast food's fine."
Stanley,This is ridiculous.
Michael,MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Phyllis,Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Jan,YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
Michael,"Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. Do you have plans tonight?"
Michael,OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
Jim,"Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working."
Jan,AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
Michael,"Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday."
Michael,"THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!"
Dwight,Thank you Michael.
Woman,I'm gonna get going.
Michael,"All right, happy Friday. Well I think we dodged a bullet there."
Dwight,Fine. Get outta here.
Jim,I think you did.
Jim,It's getting late.
Michael,"I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?"
Michael,"You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon."
Jim,"Oh, I-"
Jim,Of course
Michael,You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
Dwight,"Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?"
Jim,"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate."
Officer 1,"Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?"
Dwight,"Michael, what time should I be arriving?"
Michael,Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
Michael,"Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy."
Officer 2,The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Andy,Hey-o!
Michael,Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Dwight,Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?
Officer 1,You wanna press charges?
Jan,Hi.
Michael,Would she get into trouble?
Michael,Hello.
Officer,Yes. She'd be charged.
Jim,Hi.
Michael,I will take the fall. I did it.
Jan,How are you?
Officer 2,"You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet."
Michael,Come on in. Good to see you.
Jan,Michael! Michael. What are you doing to him?
Jan,Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
Officer 1,"Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?"
Michael,"Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?"
Dwight,Michael can come home with me.
Jim,"Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?"
Michael,Jim? Pam?
Michael,Yeah.
Jim,Oh... my apartment's on fire
Jim,I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Pam,Flooded.
Michael,Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
Jim,Flooded.
Jim,Really?
Dwight,You people. Come on. You're sleeping with me.
Michael,Except driving.
Michael,No.
Pam,We got you this.
Dwight,I'm gonna take you home Michael.
Jan,"Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with."
Michael,Nope.
Michael,"Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa."
Dwight,Alright.
Pam,It's really nice.
Jan,Bye Babe!
Jan,"So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?"
Pam,"This is the best burger I've ever had, babe."
Jim,"Tour, let's do the tour first."
Jim,"You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad."
Michael,Okay.
Pam,Hmm?
Jan,Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
Jim,I stole this. For you babe.
Michael,Totally your call babe.
Pam,One night...
Jan,"Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs."
Jim,"Oh, you guys doing a little construction?"
Michael,"Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door."
Jan,"Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here."
Michael,"Well, thats..."
Jan,This is my office.
Michael,"Yep, never been used."
Jan,Not super exciting.
Michael,No.
Jan,And this is my workspace.
Michael,"This is it, check that out, can you smell that?"
Pam,Uh-huh.
Michael,As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
Pam,So you have an office and a workspace?
Jan,"I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. Smell."
Jim,It's fire.
Jan,"Uh-huh, Bonfire."
Michael,Bond.
Jan,Men love this one.
Michael,"James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn."
Jan,"When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away."
Jim,Just like that.
Jan,Just like that.
Jan,"So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white."
Michael,"Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color."
Jan,Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Michael,"Well, I-"
Jan,Shame on you.
Pam,What a cute bench.
Michael,"Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy."
Jim,Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Michael,It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
Jan,"See, he fits perfectly."
Michael,"I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? Voila, right in the wall."
Jim,Wow.
Michael,"Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table."
Jim,What is that chestnut?
Michael,"No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry."
Jan,It's pine.
Jim,"Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool."
Jan,Really?
Pam,"Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week."
Michael,"If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away."
Jan,I bet you are.
Jim,"Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see."
Jan,"It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said ""Honey keep the trophies."""
Michael,"Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies."
Jan,"Oh, excuse us just a second."
Michael,I'll get it.
Jan,So glad you're finally able to be here.
Angela,"No, no."
Michael,Okay.
Andy,"Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! These are for you."
Jan,"Oh, how thoughtful."
Michael,Very nice.
Andy,"Except for one flower, which is for... my flower."
Jan,Aw.
Angela,What am I supposed to do with this?
Jan,How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
Pam,Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Jan,"Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done."
Pam,Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4
Jan,"You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight."
Michael,When in Rome.
Jan,"Do you have a preference, upstairs first?"
Michael,Whatever you say babe.
Jan,Follow me.
Michael,All right.
Michael,How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
All,Cheers.
Michael,Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
Jim,What was that?
Jan,"So music, should we turn some music?"
Michael,Yeah that sounds good.
Jan,Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Hunter's CD,"You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah."
Michael,"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him."
Jan,Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Angela,Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
Pam,"I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party."
Andy,No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
Jan,Joe Camel!
Andy,"Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital."
Pam,Montana.
Jan,Oh!
Pam,Joe Montana!
Andy,Yes! Yes.
Pam,Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
Michael,"All right, my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn."
Jan,"Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?"
Michae,"What, no, I'm just making people laugh."
Jan,No.
Michael,"Yes, I was watching Jim's face."
Jan,I was watching Jim.
Michael,And he was laughing.
Jan,No smiling.
Michael,"Look at him, he's laughing."
Jim,Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it.
Jim,"You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage."
Pam,Oh okay.
Michael,Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Jim,"That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much."
Pam,"Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself."
Jim,I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Pam,You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
Michael,"That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right."
Andy,"Michael, you're up."
Michael,"All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-"
Jan,"No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes."
Michael,"All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE."
Angela,I don't know.
Jim,Katie Holmes.
Michael,"No, Baah! But he's married to her!"
Jim,"Oh, Dawson's Creek."
Michael,"No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger."
Jan,No rhyming!
Jim,Not really a rhyme.
Angela,"Another clue, another clue."
Michael,"Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator."
Angela,Those aren't helpful.
Jim,Tom Cruise!
Michael,No!
Andy,Time!
Michael,"God, does anybody read the paper?!"
Pam,"Oh, thank you."
Michael,You're welcome.
Jan,"I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?"
Michael,I don't like that story babe.
Jan,"Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!"
Michael,"Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible."
Jan,"You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil."
Michael,"Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!"
Angela,You shouldn't joke about that.
Pam,Is there more wine in the kitchen?
Jan,"I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip."
Jan,"Uh, not even close."
Angela,So you keep a very tidy house.
Jan,"You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam."
Pam,"No, yeah. What?"
Jan,Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Pam,"Oh, are you joking?"
Jan,"Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him."
Pam,"I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever."
Angela,I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
Jan,Mmhmm.
Michael,So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
Jim,Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Michael,"Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of ""Serenity by Jan"" What do you think about that?"
Andy,"Thought about it, I'm in."
Jim,"I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?"
Michael,I'm sorry. What now?
Jan,Coming!
Dwight,Hello.
Jan,What are you doing here?
Dwight,"We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?"
Pam,Awesome.
Jan,What is he doing here?
Angela,"Yes, What are you doing here?"
Michael,Dwight is my friend.
Woman,We weren't invited?
Michael,"You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person."
Jan,"Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want."
Michael,"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?"
Jan,We saw Wicked.
Michael,"When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children."
Jan,"I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have aing kid."
Michael,Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
Jan,I hate my life.
Dwight,So can we come in?
Dwight,Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Jan,I'm just gonna check on dinner.
Dwight,"Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?"
Angela,I hate beet salad.
Woman,It's actually really good.
Dwight,Hey hey hey hey. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
Angela,The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Michael,Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
Pam,Like... like what?
Michael,"I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. Hey, looks great babe."
Andy,Yeah it does.
Pam,I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
Jan,Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Michael,"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?"
Jan,Oops.
Michael,Excuse me for a second.
Jim,So... how do you guys know each other?
Woman,I was his babysitter.
Pam,And now you guys are dating?
Dwight,Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Jim,Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Woman,E-mail?
Jim,Nevermind.
Michael,Ok... alright... here we go. There. Oooookay.
Jim,That's nice.
Michael,Everybody enjoying their meal?
Jan,Hey babe?
Michael,Yeah?
Jan,How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Michael,No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Jan,Ok.
Michael,Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
Jan,At least he's an artist.
Michael,BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Jan,AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Michael,NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Jan,FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Pam,W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Jim,So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Pam,Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Jim,"Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken."
Pam,Nature.
Oscar,Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Andy,"I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar."
Kevin,"I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed."
Pam,Some of us like the walk more than others.
Kevin,Hurts like hell.
Pam,Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Michael,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair."
Pam,"But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair."
Pam,"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. I really want it."
Michael,Have you ever seen this woman?
Pam,Her?
Michael,Hmm...
Pam,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Michael,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch."
Pam,Or in a great chair.
Michael,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?"
Pam,I definitely remember your dinner party.
Michael,I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Pam,"Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair."
Michael,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
Michael,"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85."
Creed,"Yo, is this his new chair?"
Pam,"No, he hasn't picked one yet."
Creed,Daat!
Creed,"When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go."
Michael,"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all."
Andy,I left my cell phone in my car.
Phyllis,Call us when you get there so we know you're OK.
Michael,"Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?"
Kevin,"If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself."
Michael,I thought that you were engaged?
Kevin,Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Michael,"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?"
Kevin,Not anymore.
Michael,Oh...
Kevin,It's a bitter situation.
Michael,Yeah... ugh. She's... you don't deserve her. Alright.
Michael,"Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm..."
Phyllis,Michael?
Michael,What?
Phyllis,I have a friend who's single.
Michael,Oh.
Phyllis,"Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too."
Michael,"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?"
Phyllis,"Umm, no, she's a professional softball player."
Michael,Oooo. Catcher or in field?
Phyllis,Umm I don't know Michael.
Michael,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?"
Phyllis,What are you asking?
Michael,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
Phyllis,"No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat."
Michael,"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!"
Michael,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
Michael,"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes."
Angela,I don't think that this is---
Michael,"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear ""Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la."" No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired."
Dwight,Write legibly people.
Andy,"Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot."
Michael,Hmm..
Andy,It's like a ten minute walk.
Kevin,"No, thirty."
Michael,"Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. OK, yes that would be bad."
Kevin,Yes.
Andy,Yes.
Michael,That would be bad.
Andy,OK.
Kevin,Nice.
Andy,...So help us out.
Michael,"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't."
Kevin,"Michael, please he--"
Michael,"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves."
Andy,We won't let you down.
Michael,"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards."
Stanley,There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
Phyllis,"Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it."
Pam,Who are you putting down?
Jim,"Oh, you don't know her."
Pam,Who is it?
Jim,Your mom.
Pam,"Yeah, whatever. Give it to me. Give it to me."
Michael,"Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try."
Wendy's phone operator,Wendy's.
Michael,"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael."
Wendy's phone operator,This isn't Wendy.
Michael,"Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?"
Wendy's phone operator,"Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant."
Michael,"Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?"
Wendy's phone operator,You have to come to the restaurant to order food.
Michael,"Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready."
Wendy's phone operator,It's ready now.
Michael,Well put it aside. Umm... yeah.
Dwight,"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies."
Michael,Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
Dwight,"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit."
Michael,"That sounds good. Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go."
Dwight,"That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed."
Dwight,"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed."
Michael,She's dead? She's so young.
Dwight,She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Michael,"Oh, God. Oh..."
Dwight,Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. Here we go. Yeah.
Jim,"Michael, you didn't even know her."
Michael,Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
Dwight,"Jim, how dare you."
Michael,"Please, not at a time like this."
Pam,"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you."
Michael,Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
Pam,"No, I mean it. She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along."
Michael,"I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?"
Pam,"I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this."
Michael,"No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again."
Kevin,We need to assemble the five families.
Michael,"No, not the five families."
Kevin,We have to.
Kevin,"The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him ""Cool Guy Paul."" W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean."
Michael,"Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now."
Kevin,I'm calling the meeting anyway.
Michael,"Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady."
Margaret,Michael?
Michael,Ugh.
Margaret,Are you Michael Scott?
Michael,Is who a Michael what?
Margaret,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael."
Michael,"Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK..."
Coffee shop worker,Michael? Michael? Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint.
Michael,So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
Margaret,You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?
Michael,Just making conversation.
Michael,"Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?"
Margaret,I don't know.
Michael,You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. Look at that.
Margaret,She's beautiful.
Michael,"Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know."
Jan [on phone],Michael? Hello? Michael?
Margaret,I'm gonna head out.
Michael,"Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus."
Margaret,That's incredibly rude.
Michael,Now you ruined it.
Bob Vance,Where's Scott?
Andy,Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
W.B. Jones,Let's just meet back in an hour.
Andy,"Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone."
Kevin,I... have... things...
W.B. Jones,"Alright, what do you want?"
Andy,"Well first of all, I'd just like to say what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen."
W.B. Jones,You have about ten seconds---
Kevin,We want our parking spaces back!
Paul Faust,Whose parking spaces?
Kevin,W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Bill Cress,Ohh... God...
Paul,I don't have time for this you guys. Just give 'em back their spaces.
W.B. Jones,OK.
Paul,We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail.
Kevin,"After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... It's just nice to win one."
Michael,"Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?"
Pam,She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
Michael,"Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God..."
Jim,Margaret?
Pam,I know.
Jim,You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment.
Pam,"Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move."
Jim,"Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud."
Pam,"Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too."
Jim,"OK, sure. Let's do it."
Pam,"No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged."
Jim,"Have I not proposed to you, yet?"
Pam,"Hmm, I don't, know..."
Jim,"Oh, well, that's coming."
Pam,"Oh, right now?"
Jim,"No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame."
Pam,"OK, so then, when?"
Jim,"Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works."
Pam,"Oh, right, yeah."
Jim,"Wait, I'm serious. It's happening."
Pam,Ohh kay.
Jim,"And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp."
Pam,I've been warned.
Jim,I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating.
Michael,I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just...
Dwight,You know what you need? Closure.
Michael,You're right. What do you mean though?
Dwight,"There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye."
Michael,Hmm.
Dwight,Come on. I'll drive.
Kevin,We did it.
Andy,I did it.
Kevin,We got our spaces back.
Oscar,Wow.
Pam,Nice job.
Jim,Nice.
Andy,"Yeah, there it is. You're welcome."
Andy,"Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park."
Michael,How did she die?
Dwight,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
Michael,God.
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,She was so innocent.
Dwight,She was stoned apparently.
Michael,"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?"
Dwight,You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Michael,"Oh, you move on."
Dwight,Yeah.
Jim,Where do you want to go for dinner?
Pam,"I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what, that one..."
Jim,"Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?"
Pam,I hate you.
Jim,"What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh."
Pam,"Oh, oh."
Jim,"No, no, no."
Pam,How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Michael,"Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off and die?"
Michael/Dwight,"OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues..."
Michael,Return.
Dwight,Rhythm and blues...
Michael,This'll be the day that I died.
Pam,What's wrong Michael?
Ryan,"Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?"
Michael,I got gum in my hair.
Michael,"Yeah, maybe."
Pam,You do.
Ryan,"It's inevitable, right?"
Michael,"This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it."
Michael,Hmm...
Dwight,You've got a ton of dandruff.
Jim,"Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up."
Michael,"OK, let me be."
Hank,Hello?
Jim,How'd you get gum in your hair?
Jim,Haaank. Is that you?
Michael,"I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil."
Hank,Yeah.
Jim,"But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter."
Jim,"Still haven't left the house yet, huh?"
Michael,Kill me... right now.
Hank,I'll get ready to leave.
Pam,We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
Jim,Good. Please hurry.
Michael,I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Hank,Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks!
Jim,"Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am."
Jim,Will do. I'll stop calling.
Pam,"No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad."
Michael,"I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls."
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about."
Pam,"Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow."
Michael,Smells good.
Oscar,Why?
Dwight,Taste good too.
Pam,"I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday."
Michael,Oh don't. That's disgusting.
Toby,"More like ""Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday."" I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now."
Dwight,Wow! Lot of calories.
Michael,Those girls really wailed on you bad.
Michael,"Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice."
Ryan,Why wouldn't they let me dance?
Dwight,"Hey Michael, how was your date last night?"
Michael,Well...
Michael,
Troy,OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital.
Michael,I will be honest
Michael,Pretty weird.
Oscar,"I am livid, Absolutely livid."
Tall Girl #1,You have to go with me.
Angela,It's ridiculous.
Dwight,"I do, I have to go."
Ryan,"Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working."
Tall Girl #1,"Stay. Stay, please?"
Ryan,My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
Dwight,"No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?"
Jim,"Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?"
Tall Girl #1,Call me.
Ryan,Love it. Go.
Dwight,Uh huh. I'm not gonna call her.
Jim,"Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that."
Michael,Let's go.
Ryan,"I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that."
Ryan,I don't wanna go back in.
Jim,Thanks.
Michael,"I know, here we go."
Ryan,"David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?"
Jim,"Cleaning people. Oscar. OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us."
Jim,Did I? I don't...
Oscar,Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
Ryan,You did. Yeah.
Jim,I... just... if they speak Spanish.
Jim,Hmm.
Oscar,"Good evening, we locked ourselves in. Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?"
Ryan,Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
Cleaning lady,Ohh...
Michael,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or..."
Oscar,They happened to speak Spanish.
Ryan,Ok thanks Michael.
Jim,Lucky us.
Michael,Yeah.
Ryan,"This is a one time thing, you know that right?"
Ryan,I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Dwight,Wow.
Dwight,Question.
Michael,This is it.
Ryan,Dwight.
Dwight,All right.
Dwight,Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Michael,This is where the magic happens.
Ryan,This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Dwight,Nice.
Stanley,"I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that."
Michael,Very nice.
Ryan,"I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O."
Ryan,"One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have..."
Stanley,When will that be?
Dwight,I got sofa. I got sofa.
Ryan,TBD. Phyllis?
Michael,"Dwight, I'm the boss."
Phyllis,Did the police solve the problem with the...
Dwight,I got floor.
Ryan,"Yes, yes they did, yes they did."
Michael,"Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on."
Ryan,"Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators."
Dwight,"Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?"
Dwight,I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Ryan,No.
Jim,"Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one."
Michael,"Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone."
Ryan,"It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election"
Dwight,It's a lullaby.
Jim,"And then an older gentleman asked you ""Boxers or briefs?"""
Michael,"Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off."
Creed,"I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site."
Ryan,"No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?"
Kelly,"If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself."
Dwight,I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Ryan,Do you have a question Kelly?
Michael,"Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it."
Kelly,"Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?"
Ryan,"Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?"
Michael,"Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good."
Dwight,OK. Good night Ryan.
Michael,Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Michael,Best night ever.
Ryan,You too.
Michael,"Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys."
Michael,"Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad."
Hank,Son of a bitch.
Ryan,Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Michael,Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
Ryan,Na.
Michael,Na?
Ryan,Sorry man.
Michael,Well you tried.
Ryan,"But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city."
Michael,Yeah.
Ryan,Unreal.
Michael,They sound great.
Ryan,"Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace."
Michael,Would you have s*x with Meredith?
Jim,What?
Michael,Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
Jim,I'm gonna go to my desk.
Michael,"Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that..."
Jim,I know.
Michael,Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
Jim,I can't.
Michael,"Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome."
Jim,I'm not single.
Michael,Who you dating?
Jim,Pam.
Michael,That's still going on?
Michael,"Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls."
Dwight,Yeah!
Andy,Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
Angela,I'm right here.
Dwight,"No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three."
Michael,"Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift."
Angela,We get it.
Michael,I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
Dwight,With s*x!
Michael,"That's... I, I think that..."
Jim,"You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow."
Jim,"So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one."
Michael,Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
Michael,Place is packed.
Dwight,Fire hazard.
Michael,"Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall."
Dwight,Women look like white slaves.
Michael,"No, they're just hotties."
Ryan,"I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour."
Michael,Hey.
Ryan,Michael.
Michael,Hey!
Ryan,What are you doing here?
Michael,"Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada."
Ryan,That is so awesome man!
Michael,Alright!
Ryan,And you brought this guy!
Michael,Yeah.
Ryan,Aww!
Michael,"Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight."
Ryan,I know it's you guys.
Michael,Ok.
Ryan,I'm so psyched you're here!
Michael,Well.
Ryan,Woooo!
Michael,Alright!
Ryan,Let's get a drink.
Michael,Let's do it!
Jim,"Thanks a lot guys, Good job."
Kevin,Later.
Jim,Nice job everybody. Great work.
Stanley,Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Jim,"Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now."
Pam,"You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left."
Stanley,"Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead."
Pam,"There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, ""What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?"" He said, ""If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks."""
Ryan,"Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy."
Michael,"Hey, nice to meet you."
Troy,"Hey, how ya doing?"
Dwight,"Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character."
Ryan,"Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard."
Dwight,"No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit."
Ryan,Bottle service ya'll?
Michael,"Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour."
Waitress,We don't serve food here.
Michael,"Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries."
Dwight,Do you live in a regular sized house?
Ryan,"Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool."
Jim,You really don't have his phone number?
Pam,"I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?"
Toby,I might have it in here.
Pam,Aw! That's great Toby.
Toby,It's so random that I have it.
Pam,"Toby, you're the best."
Toby,"When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it."
Jim,"Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or..."
Toby,No.
Jim,It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Andy,"Yes, it's Eddie."
Jim,"It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or..."
Creed,"Hank, his name is Hank."
Jim,"No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?"
Phyllis,Elliot.
Oscar,Elliot!
Jim,"Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?"
Ryan,Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
Dwight,Good.
Ryan,This guy owns his own beet farm.
Troy,Insane.
Dwight,Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Ryan,"Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?"
Dwight,"They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out."
Ryan,"Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom."
Dwight,You've already been several times.
Ryan,Yeah.
Dwight,Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
Ryan,"I don't know, maybe."
Dwight,I'll order you some cranberry juice.
Ryan,"With vodka, you're the best."
Dwight,Do you have powers?
Jim,"Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. He said it should just be under an hour, so... we did it."
Oscar,We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Toby,"Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's."
Angela,"Yeah, neither did I."
Phyllis,Jim was supposed to collect it.
Jim,Yup...
Kevin,"Way to go, man."
Kelly,Now he's never gonna come.
Andy,"By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam?"
Pam,Phyllis.
Michael,"I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting ""Back to the Future."" ""Back"" because it's on my back and ""Future"" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie."
Girl in Club,I've never heard of that movie.
Michael,"Back to the Future? Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course."
Girl in Club,How old are you?
Michael,Forty... I'm in my forties.
Girl in Club,Wow. That's so cool.
Michael,Nuhh...
Girl in Club,Well I'm gonna go back to my group now.
Michael,"Oh, OK."
Girl in Club,Thanks for the drink.
Michael,You are welcome.
Michael,This place is like sexy pre-school.
Ryan,Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
Michael,I would love a place where we could meet older girls.
Ryan,Hell yeah. I'll hook it up.
Michael,"Ahh, wow. That's dangerous."
Ryan,"Check again, Ryan Howard."
Dwight,Excuse me.
Tall Girl #1,Yeah?
Dwight,How did you all find each other?
Tall Girl #1,"Uh, we're the Jersey State Varsity Basketball team. Northeast Regional Champs."
All Girls,Wooo!
Dwight,Amazons.
Ryan,It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Michael,You're kidding.
Ryan,Let's bail.
Dwight,"Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. You two, Jersey State girls, let's go."
Tall Girl #2,We're not going unless we can all go.
Dwight,"OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go."
Toby,"Hey, look what I found in the back. Wanna play? Teach you to throw."
Pam,I know how to throw a football.
Toby,Course you do.
Andy,"Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo!"
Meredith,Owww!
Kevin,Oh God.
Bartender,There you go.
Dwight,"Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?"
Bartender,It's for you. From them.
Dwight,Oh.
Troy,What are you doing man?
Dwight,It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. Nice try.
Michael,I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
Girl in 2nd club,That's one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do?
Michael,I am a bank teller.
Michael,Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
Girl in 2nd club,Cool.
Michael,I think so.
Girl in 2nd club,Yeah.
Michael,"Yeah, I have fun."
Girl in 2nd club,I'm just gonna just use the powder room.
Michael,All right.
Girl in 2nd club,So I'll see ya soon.
Michael,Very perfect. Oh my This needs to be shared.
Michael,She washes dogs.
Ryan,You're doing it man.
Michael,"I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom."
Michael,"Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!"
Michael,"You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand."
Pam,Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
Stanley,Fine. Here it is
Michael,"Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?"
Michael,"Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well."
Kevin,Michael you could put your initials in it.
Stanley,"Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?"
Michael,M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Michael,"All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it."
Jim,Yeah that's true.
Stanley,Fair enough.
Michael,"Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!"
Michael,"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after s*x, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, ""I don't respect you!"" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. Respect is niiice. Borat. What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!"
Phyllis,We-- we--
Michael,"So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?"
Michael,Here we go!
Stanley,Has potential to be your best idea yet.
Phyllis,Well--
Phyllis,That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
Michael,"Let's, yes?"
Michael,"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis."
Phyllis,When I was a little girl...
Michael,"Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!"
Phyllis,We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Michael,"It's drying, it's drying..."
Phyllis,In our neighborhood...
Michael,"Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!"
Phyllis,What did we write?
Michael,Ahh come on!
Andy,"Here it is, you should draw a picture..."
Michael,No!
Andy,"Cause that says, that says..."
Michael,No!
Andy,So much more than words...
Michael,"No!! Come on, gimme something good!"
Kelly,"Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good..."
Michael,"Pam, translate."
Pam,She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Michael,I love it!
Jim,If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Michael,I love it more!
Oscar,Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
Michael,"I... love it!! Haha, come on!"
Dwight,Come on!
Jim,"We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man."
Michael,"Hurry, please."
Jim,"Greatness is only skin deep, some people say..."
Dwight,Can you breathe?
Jim,Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Dwight,Hold your breath.
Jim,And in this case...
Dwight,Ready?
Jim,That's also not true.
Dwight,And... go. Force it in as deep as you can.
Michael,That's what she said.
Michael,"Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, ""That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..."" I dunno, it's a good feeling."
Andy,"Okay, adjective..."
Angela,"Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice."
Andy,"Good one. Okay, you ready?"
Angela,Mmhmm.
Andy,"The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. ""Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?"""
Angela,It's a man eating cat food.
Andy,What about a cat eating man food?
Dwight,Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
Pam,"Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up."
Michael,"All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction..."
Pam,I don't have my contacts...
Michael,"Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room."
Michael,Ener-gize...
Jim,"You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly..."
Pam,"Don't, don't--"
Jim,Would...
Pam,"If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no."
Jim,"Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world."
Michael,"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?"
Andy,"What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?"
Michael,"Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?"
Jim,What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Michael,"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme..."
Jim,An urban thing...
Michael,"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley..."
Stanley,Not me.
Michael,"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group."
Stanley,No.
Michael,"Stanley, we're havin a little..."
Stanley,"Leave me alone, dammit."
Michael,We're havin a little brainstorm session...
Stanley,DID I STUTTER?
Michael,"...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water."
Toby,Can I talk to you a second?
Michael,"Ugh, what?"
Toby,"Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning..."
Michael,What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
Toby,"Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate."
Michael,That? In the conference room?
Toby,Yeah.
Michael,"We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said ""did I stutter,"" and I said ""wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?"" It was joking, Toby, alright?"
Toby,He didn't seem like he was joking.
Michael,"Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another"
Toby,"Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking..."
Michael,Mmhmm.
Toby,"Um, why don't you go ask him that?"
Michael,"Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but..."
Toby,"You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school..."
Michael,"Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological."
Andy,"You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker."
Dwight,Unh! Scratch.
Andy,That's a racing stripe.
Dwight,"Uh, bumper's sagging."
Andy,"Mmm, I doubt that very much."
Dwight,This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Andy,How next to?
Dwight,"Well, here are your options"
Andy,I have to pick one of those?
Dwight,Yes.
Andy,Can you go over those options again?
Dwight,"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now."
Andy,"Well I have the, the blue book value..."
Dwight,"Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--"
Andy,Can I think about it?
Dwight,"Five, four, three, two..."
Andy,Let me think about it--
Dwight,Now. Now. Now.
Andy,Let me think about it--
Dwight,Say it. Do it. Now.
Andy,I'm thinking about it--
Dwight,Do it now.
Andy,Thinking--
Dwight,Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Andy,Yeah. All right!
Stanley,What.
Michael,"I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal."
Stanley,What are you talking about?
Michael,"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool."
Stanley,I am not going to apologize to you.
Stanley,"It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too."
Dwight,"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?"
Michael,Uh huh...
Dwight,There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Michael,Great
Dwight,"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly."
Michael,What's the pink?
Dwight,Menstrual cycles.
Michael,"Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?"
Dwight,You.
Michael,Other than me.
Dwight,"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office."
Michael,I never said you could do that.
Dwight,All you have to do it say it.
Michael,I...
Dwight,Just say it.
Michael,"Okay, I will think about it."
Dwight,"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it."
Michael,No.
Dwight,"So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself."
Kevin,"Hey Pam, I really like your glasses."
Pam,"Oh, thanks."
Kevin,All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
Pam,"Oh, okay..."
Kevin,"Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually..."
Pam,I should probably get back to...
Kevin,Like librarians.
Pam,Entering the....
Kevin,"Could you just say, ""these are due back Thursday""?"
Pam,No. [Kevin leaves
Creed,"A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless."
Darryl,Mike.
Michael,Hey.
Darryl,"I'm very busy here, man."
Michael,"Darryl, have you ever been in a gang?"
Darryl,Why?
Michael,"It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um..."
Darryl,"No, no, no..."
Michael,"I know, it's very, very personal..."
Darryl,"No, um... I have."
Michael,"I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?"
Darryl,Both.
Michael,God.
Darryl,"Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors..."
Michael,Okay.
Darryl,Newsies.
Michael,"Okay, so dig this"
Darryl,Oh my goodness.
Michael,"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?"
Darryl,"Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers."
Michael,What is that?
Darryl,"That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them."
Michael,Really?
Darryl,"Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone."
Michael,I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Darryl,"Well, it's effective."
Ryan,"I think it's self-explanatory. Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?"
Jim,Oh boy...
Ryan,How do you live with a franchise this bad?
Jim,"On a wing and a prayer, mostly."
Ryan,"Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance."
Jim,A formal warning...
Ryan,"It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
Jim,"I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head."
Ryan,"This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it."
Jim,"I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really..."
Ryan,"Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?"
Toby,"I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam"
Pam,"Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?"
Jim,"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff..."
Pam,Because you're very important?
Jim,Yeah...
Dwight,Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
Andy,What the hell is this all about? You're flipping my car for profit.
Dwight,It's my car now.
Andy,I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
Dwight,"Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay."
Dwight,I've got a Madlib for you
Michael,"Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him."
Pam,What does that mean?
Michael,It's like a mock execution.
Jim,That's not a good idea.
Michael,Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
Toby,"Well, you can actually fire him."
Michael,"No, okay... I've had enough of you."
Oscar,Why are you telling us this?
Michael,"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?"
Kevin,"Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him."
Michael,"I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?"
Michael,"Stanley Hudson, you are fired."
Stanley,Are you serious?
Michael,"I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack."
Stanley,You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
Michael,Hmm.
Stanley,"I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office."
Michael,"Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice."
Stanley,So I'm not fired.
Michael,That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Stanley,"Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?"
Michael,Okay...
Stanley,Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Michael,Yes.
Stanley,Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Michael,That's not-
Stanley,"And I think, ""there's no possible way--"
Michael,"All right, all right..."
Stanley,"He can top that."""
Michael,Okay.
Stanley,"But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!"
Michael,"Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out."
Jim,Who?
Michael,"Everybody, except Stanley."
Jim,Let's go.
Pam,I can't find my glasses.
Jim,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here."
Pam,"Okay, okay."
Kevin,"It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!"
Michael,I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
Stanley,"Oh, for the love of God."
Michael,"Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!"
Oscar,Yes.
Michael,"Yeah, I'm pretty excited too."
Michael,"Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place."
Darryl,"Hey, are we doing this thing?"
Michael,Yup.
Kelly,"Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!"
Michael,Why are you dressed like that?
Darryl,Like what?
Michael,Like you're applying for a loan.
Dwight,Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
Darryl,Figured I look presentable. You? Went a different way.
Pam,I think you look nice.
Michael and Darryl,Thank you.
Michael,"Okay, here's what we're going to do"
Darryl,What college did you go to Mike?
Michael,Let's go!
Jim,"Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try."
Phil Maguire,Whoa!
Jim,"Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years."
Phil Maguire,"Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man."
Andy,"Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am... totally and completely kidding! Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95."
Phil Maguire,"Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74"
Andy,"Oop, got some blisties."
Phil Maguire,"Yeah, you do."
Andy,"Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful."
Phil,"Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?"
Jim,Great!
Kevin,"What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?"
Kevin,"I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent."
Pam,"So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!"
Michael,"A little over the top, don't you think?"
Darryl,"Show them what you brought, Mike."
Pam,"Um, that's all we brought."
Michael,This is all we need.
Oscar,We'll see.
Michael,"Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! Hello!"
Kevin,"Andy, you're up, let's go!"
Andy,"Giddy up, let's do this."
Andy,"People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my ""knot"" on."
Andy,Dammit!
Meredith,"Guys, do we have to stay all day?"
Phyllis,"I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?"
Creed,"Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!"
Dwight,"Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences."
Phyllis,What consequences?
Dwight,I will tell on you.
Pam,"There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!"
Justin,Cool.
Pam,"Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs."
Michael,Hello. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Pam,"This is Michael, my boss. Justin."
Michael,"Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, ""only the best and the brightest."""
Pam,He's nice and he seems interested.
Michael,"He's totally wrong, Pam. Hey."
Justin,Hi.
Michael,"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby."
Justin,Sorry for wasting your time.
Michael,"Oh, no problem. And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately."
Darryl,"Yeah, the booth is lame without it."
Pam,I only brought the one.
Michael,Are you mental?
Pam,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, ""Are you sure Michael?"" And you said ""Pam! Pam! Pam!"" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, ""Don't worry, it's just allergies."" Do you remember that?"
Michael,I... don't.
Pam,Okay. I'll go look for another one.
Michael,And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
Jim,"Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?"
Phil,"I can't complain, people love their junk mail."
Jim,Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
Phil,"You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?"
Jim,"Absolutely, will do."
Jim,So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
Michael,Hello there.
Kid,What is this company?
Michael,"Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company..."
Oscar,Dunder Mifflin paper.
Kid,Thanks.
Michael,"Dammit, Oscar!"
Michael,"Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being ""lured"" these days. Thank you Dateline!"
Dwight,Thank you.
Angela,Extension 128.
Creed,"Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed."
Creed,"Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?"
Angela,No.
Creed,"Are you out? Pumpkin's out, let's go gang!"
Pam,"My old art room. Oh, maybe it's still here! No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind."
Michael,What do you want?
Dwight,"Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day."
Michael,"Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?"
Dwight,So... what else is up? Mich-
Michael,"Thank you! What, what is this?"
Pam,A piece of paper.
Michael,This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
Pam,Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Michael,Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
Pam,Are you serious?
Michael,Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
Pam,Okay.
Phil,"Oh! Ah, dammit!"
Jim,"You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey."
Phil,Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you.
Jim,Yep.
Angela and Dwight,
Andy,"AH! Come on, Tuna!"
Jim,"Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?"
Pam,"Just checking in, how's it going?"
Jim,"Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see."
Pam,"I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess."
Jim,"Oh, I like you."
Pam,Talk to you later?
Jim,"Yeah. All right. Bye. All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?"
Phil,"You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. Six."
Kevin,Yeah.
Andy,"All right, race to the next hole!"
Kevin,Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Andy,Shortcut! Shortcut! Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
Dwight,
Michael,"All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck."
Michael,Hey! Game over.
Michael,Just-in time.
Justin,Hi.
Michael,Just-in case. What's your last name?
Justin,Polznik.
Michael,This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
Michael,"Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now."
Michael,I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
Oscar,Hey.
Justin,Hi.
Michael,"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will ""do"" you. No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?"
Pam,Excuse me.
Michael,"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist."
Oscar,"Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?"
Michael,"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special."
Justin,You didn't want me before. That's what you said.
Michael,"No, I didn't. You misconstrued me."
Justin,You were kind of a jerk to me.
Michael,"I, uh, hmm."
Justin,"And I'm, I'm gonna go now."
Michael,Why don't... hey.
Andy,
Dwight,Ah-choo!
Angela,Bless you.
Dwight,Thank you.
Kevin,"Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty."
Phil,"Let's open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often."
Andy,Count me in!
Phil,No.
Andy,All right!
Jim,"Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?"
Phil,"I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good?"
Jim,Absolutely.
Maguire,Good playing with you guys.
Andy,Right on.
Jim,"You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good."
Woman on mic,The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
Michael,"Hold down the fort, I have to do something. Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe."
Angela,Thank you.
Dwight,You're welcome.
Pam,Beers? You closed it?
Jim,I closed it!
Pam,"Yes! Oh! Um, congratulations to you, sir."
Jim,"Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it."
Pam,Well done.
Jim,"Thank you. You know what, screw this!"
Kevin,Oooh!
Michael,"Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me."
Michael,"Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good."
Pam,Hi.
Graphics guy,Hello.
Pam,"I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?"
Graphics guy,Are you interested in graphic design?
Pam,Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
Graphics guy,"Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess."
Pam,I can do that.
Graphics guy,"Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics."
Pam,I don't know any of those.
Graphics guy,"It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design."
Pam,New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics guy,Yeah.
Pam,"All right. Cool, well... thanks."
Graphics guy,Sure.
Pam,"And uh, I'll look into those."
Graphics guy,You should.
Pam,New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics guy,Absolutely.
Pam,Okay.
Graphics guy,It's where the action is.
Pam,Thanks.
Dwight,"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. Hello?"
Michael,"Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there."
Jim,"Hello, this is Dwight."
Holly,Okay.
Dwight,Hello? Hello?
Kevin,I'll go to the diner with you.
Jim,"Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second..."
Phyllis,Hello Angela.
Holly,Oh that would be great.
Dwight,"Jim, what are you doing?"
Angela,"Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack."
Kevin,"Yeah, we can go eat pie."
Jim,And how many would you like?
Phyllis,Can I get a list of your vendors?
Holly,I love pie.
Dwight,"Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-"
Angela,I shredded it.
Kevin,Me too.
Jim,Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
Phyllis,Why would you do that?
Holly,Okay.
Dwight,This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Angela,"Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?"
Michael,Have a good night.
Jim,"Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset."
Phyllis,Sorry.
Holly,Okay. Good night.
Dwight,"K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail."
Toby,What'd you guys do?
Michael,Bye.
Jim,"Hello, this is Dwight."
Michael,"Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?"
Holly,"Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. I gotta buckle him in."
Pam,"Hey, is this Dwight?"
Toby,"Well, we still have to do the exit interview."
Michael,Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Jim,Yes it is.
Michael,Yes we do.
Toby,"Thanks... Really, Michael?"
Pam,"Oh my goodness, you sound sexy."
Michael,I'll let you in on a little secret
Michael,Sorry. Corporate policy.
Jim,"Oh, thank you. I've been working out."
Toby,"Wow, thanks, Michael, I..."
Toby,It's not.
Dwight,"Woah, woah, woah, Pam!"
Michael,"Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend."
Michael,You might take something.
Pam,Have you?
Holly,Hello.
Hank,I don't think he's gonna take anything.
Dwight,Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
Michael,"Hey! Hi, good to see you."
Michael,"Okay, security guard."
Pam,Dwight?
Holly,You too.
Toby,"Oh, some kind of... alarm."
Dwight,"No! Pam, I'm over here!"
Michael,I'm just having a little exit interview.
Michael,Okay.
Pam,I'm confused...
Holly,"Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here."
Michael,"Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. I am going to be... kind of a daddy."
Dwight,Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
Michael,"Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?"
Phyllis,Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator
Jim,Can't do that. Unsanitary.
Holly,"No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job."
Angela,[sees Phyllis
Dwight,"Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done."
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,What? [turns and sees Phyllis
Jim,This is Dwight.
Pam,Did you need me to take notes?
Jim,"Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine."
Toby,Hi Pam. Stay.
Jim,"Oh, hello Mater. Good news"
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,Argh! Ahh!!
Michael,"Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?"
Michael,"Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days."
Toby,I'm Toby.
Toby,Morning.
Michael,Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
Michael,"Mornin'. So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And..."
Holly,"Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?"
Toby,"Good morning, Kelly."
Michael,Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Kelly,I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
Holly,Here you go.
Toby,Fine. Good.
Michael,Thank you. What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
Kelly,I feel weird.
Toby,"This place, um..."
Michael,"First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party."
Michael,"Well, no no no no no..."
Angela,We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
Toby,"I've got some ideas, I guess..."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
Angela,But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Holly,"Oh, I'd like to hear the answer."
Michael,"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets..."
Toby,"Well let me see... I would, uh..."
Pam,"Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?"
Michael,[hides his face from Holly
Michael,"If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?"
Toby,I guess everything's okay.
Angela,Michael...
Toby,"I made it this far, right? What's the point?"
Michael,"Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-"
Pam,"Toby, why don't you open your present?"
Angela,No. You know-no!
Michael,"Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which..."
Michael,Toga!
Toby,[unwraps present
Angela,"You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them."
Michael,What the hell is that?
Michael,I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe
Pam,Michael...
Michael,"Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. ""Michael, buy a motorcycle."" So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now."
Michael,"That's... What do you mean, ""Michael""? That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!"
Michael,"I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around."
Dwight,You did.
Pam,So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Michael,No!
Angela,"No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating."
Dwight,You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-
Michael,"Phyllis, can you do this?"
Michael,"Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby."
Phyllis,Yes.
Pam,So what is your gift?
Pam,"Hi, can I help you?"
Michael,"My gift is forthcoming, Pam."
Holly,"Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?"
Pam,What is it?
Toby,"As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day."
Michael,I am going to give Toby...
Toby,So this is H.R. This is your desk.
Pam,Your watch?
Holly,I love the view.
Michael,"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?"
Toby,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it?"
Pam,I just knew.
Pam,Hey.
Michael,How did you know?
Jim,Hey... What?
Holly,Oh that is so sweet.
Pam,Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Michael,Well... That's my watch.
Jim,No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
Toby,"Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time."
Pam,"Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!"
Michael,"Hey, that's good."
Jim,Yes! So when do you start?
Creed,"Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! Hey! It's the temp! Look!"
Pam,"I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw ""congratulations"" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack."
Dwight,Oh my gosh.
Jim,Wow. Busy morning.
Creed,It's the temp!
Pam,"So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months..."
Pam,Is that the police?
Jim,"It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great."
Dwight,Yes.
Pam,"Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great."
Creed,Mm-hmm.
Jim,See how easy that is?
Oscar,Well this is what happened
Pam,Ohh... [they hug
Michael,Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
Pam,"I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word ""perfect"" in here!"
Kelly,"I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, ""Hi Ryan."" And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, ""Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison."""
Toby,"Hey, Stanley..."
Jim,Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
Stanley,Hmm?
Pam,Absolutely.
Toby,I want to introduce you to...
Jim,"Right to voicemail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!"
Michael,Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
Holly,What's protocol on this?
Dwight,So what do we know about her?
Toby,"I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't-"
Michael,"Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already."
Holly,"Michael, are you okay?"
Dwight,I hate her too.
Michael,I'm just worried about my friend.
Michael,Why do you hate her?
Holly,"Oh, of course you are."
Dwight,Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Michael,"Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run."
Michael,"You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me."
Holly,"No, hey."
Dwight,Would that be such a bad thing?
Michael,I'm cool.
Michael,"Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?"
Holly,Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
Dwight,What?
Michael,"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level."
Michael,We need to sell her an elevator pass.
Kevin,Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Dwight,"But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa..."
Phyllis,"Kevin, take your shoes off first!"
Michael,Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
Michael,"No antigravity machine, huh?"
Phyllis,Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Phyllis,"Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real."
Woman over speakerphone,Antigravity machines?
Michael,Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
Phyllis,That's right. Yeah.
Pam,Wow. Look at our parking lot.
Woman over speakerphone,What do they do exactly?
Jim,"Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up"
Phyllis,They make you feel lighter...
Pam,"Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?"
Woman over speakerphone,Antigravity... Um... Anti...depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.
Holly,"Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up."
Phyllis,Okay.
Michael,That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Michael,Yeah.
Holly,I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
Toby,Hey Michael.
Michael,Thanks.
Michael,"Oh, hey, do you still work here?"
Dwight,You have it?
Toby,I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
Meredith,Almost.
Michael,Nah.
Dwight,"Okay, here we go. Here we go. Put it in."
Toby,Come on.
Michael,"I like, uh..."
Michael,No. I think I will pass.
Holly,That-That's my car.
Toby,"Michael Scott, this is Holly."
Michael,Hey. What are you doing?
Holly,Hi.
Dwight,Mose!
Michael,"Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here"
Michael,What the hell is going on here?!
Holly,"Man, someone doesn't like H.R."
Dwight,N-nothing you need to know the details of.
Michael,Yeah.
Michael,"There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!"
Holly,What did you do to him?
Dwight,N-no there's not.
Toby,Nothing.
Michael,Why did you do that?
Michael,T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
Dwight,It was playful hazing.
Holly,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott."
Michael,"No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. Take care of that, all right?"
Michael,Y-You can-Michael.
Dwight,It's not rabid.
Michael,"Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet."
Michael,Shh...
Creed,The pleasure's all mine.
Meredith,Thanks for bringing that up.
Holly,"Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here."
Dwight,"Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out."
Creed,Any time.
Michael,I'm really sorry.
Holly,What do you do here?
Holly,"Michael, thank you so much for saying that. I feel so welcome here."
Creed,...Excuse me.
Michael,Yeah...
Creed,"What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. ""What do I do?""... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. ""Qua"" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close."
Holly,"I just... Um, excuse me."
Dwight,Have you been introduced to Kevin?
Michael,"Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it!"
Holly,No. Which one's Kevin?
Vance Refrigeration guy,"Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!"
Dwight,"He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain."
Phyllis,"Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. Okay."
Holly,Oh. Good for you guys.
Holly,Cool! You drive your own car?
Dwight,Yeah.
Kevin,Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Dwight,Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Holly,Yep. Just like you.
Dwight,"Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin."
Kevin,"Okay, bye."
Holly,Hello. Hello. Hi.
Holly,"Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you."
Kevin,Hi.
Michael,"Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?"
Holly,What do you do?
Pam,"Yay, Phyllis!"
Kevin,I do the numbers.
Michael,"Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter."
Holly,"Oh, good for you."
Pam,Song parody writer.
Kevin,Do you want a M&M?
Michael,"I have done things like um, ""Beers in Heaven."""
Holly,"Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though."
Jim,Classic.
Kevin,Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Michael,"Or, ""Total Eclipse of the Fart."""
Holly,Well that is a very safe place for them.
Jim,"Not my favorite, but..."
Kevin,Yeah.
Pam,I like that one.
Michael,"Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?"
Jim,It's not my favorite...
Holly,"Oh... Nice, I've never heard that one before actually."
Pam,I like that one.
Michael,I bet.
Michael,"I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. Do you know, um, ""Goodbye Stranger""? Supertramp?"
Holly,That's good.
Darryl,Yeah.
Michael,I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Michael,It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
Holly,"No, no, I..."
Pam,"I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office."
Michael,"Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?"
Michael,"Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise..."
Holly,"Ooh, uh..."
Pam,"Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute."
Michael,"You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?"
Michael,"Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!"
Holly,Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Holly,Not bad.
Michael,All right.
Michael,"Oh, hey. Thanks."
Holly,Thanks.
Holly,"Someday I would love to hear ""Beers in Heaven."""
Michael,Yep.
Michael,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. Sorry. Kevin. Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy."
Holly,Great.
Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here."
Pam,Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Michael,Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
Toby,You're-you're not in it.
Kevin,"No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see."
Pam,Well I was taking the picture.
Michael,What is it?
Toby,"I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica."
Kevin,Just hurry.
Pam,"Sure, do you have a camera here?"
Holly,Is he okay?
Toby,"No, uh... Does anyone have a camera here? No one has a camera here. Uh..."
Michael,Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
Pam,Okay...
Holly,"Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him."
Toby,I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay.
Michael,"Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes"
Jim,"So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big."
Jan,Well it was good to see you.
Ryan,Congratulations!
Kevin,"It was great to see you, Jan."
Jim,Thanks.
Jan,"Yeah, so..."
Ryan,Don't interrupt.
Michael,O-kay. Hello Jan.
Jim,I just-
Jan,Hello... Michael.
Ryan,Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
Michael,"Wow, Kevin, really? We're- Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. Is this why you called me down here?"
Jim,"No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so..."
Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, I just uh..."
Ryan,"All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website."
Jan,I...
Jim,"All right, well it already went through, so..."
Kevin,I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Ryan,Don't worry about that. Just re-log it.
Michael,"Oh, okay."
Jim,Hello?
Kevin,Yeah.
Michael,Hmm... Jim? I am downloading some N3P...
Michael,"Thanks, Kevin. Um..."
Jim,That's not it.
Michael,Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! Are you nauseous?
Michael,Music...
Jan,No.
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?"
Michael,For a CD mix tape...
Jan,"Uh, no."
Jim,Close.
Michael,Good. Good. Thank God.
Michael,For Holly.
Jan,I didn't...
Jim,Mmhmm.
Michael,Cause that's...
Michael,And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
Jan,... touch that.
Jim,What are the two levels?
Michael,"Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy..."
Michael,"The two levels being, uh, ""Welcome to Scranton""..."
Jan,Why?
Jim,Mmhmm.
Michael,"Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very..."
Michael,"And ""I... love you."""
Jan,"Yeah, it did..."
Jim,"Okay. Let's start with the ""I love you"" level."
Michael,... proud.
Michael,"Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?"
Jan,... happen when...
Jim,Yes. You don't love Holly.
Michael,Um...
Michael,I think I do.
Jan,"... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad."
Jim,But you just met her.
Michael,You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
Michael,"Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears."
Jan,"...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not."
Jim,"Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that."
Michael,"Well, okay..."
Michael,"Well, you're not a romantic."
Jan,Yeah.
Jim,"Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance."
Michael,"So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so..."
Michael,Oh really?
Jan,I went to a sperm bank.
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,You did?
Michael,"Like, with who?"
Jan,Yuh-huh.
Jim,We've been through this.
Michael,When we were going out?
Michael,Pam?
Jan,"Uh, yeah."
Jim,"Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow."
Michael,W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
Michael,"Yeah, you took it too slow."
Jan,I know.
Jim,"Well, we're really happy."
Michael,You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
Michael,This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
Jan,"No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables."
Jim,"And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her."
Michael,IHop.
Michael,I don't want her to get away.
Jan,IHop.
Jim,"I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work."
Jan,"If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count."
Jim,I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
Jan,"Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table."
Phyllis,"Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't..."
Michael,I'm glad you told me.
Jim,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party."
Jan,"Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner..."
Phyllis,Why would you do that?
Michael,"Um, I'll... I have to think about it."
Jim,"Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go."
Jan,Okay.
Phyllis,Really?
Michael,"My whole life, I have known two things"
Jim,"Well we all want a good party, right?"
Pam,"Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display"
Jim,I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
Angela,"Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again."
Holly,Hey Kevin.
Jim,Hey...
Kevin,Hi.
Andy,"Can I have your attention please? I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? Okay, then I will come to you, my flower."
Holly,Do you need some help?
Darryl,Unh! Damn it!
Kevin,I can't decide what to get.
Andy,"Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage?"
Holly,"Well, what do you like to eat?"
Angela,...Okay.
Kevin,"Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips."
Andy,"Into the mic, sweetie."
Holly,"Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row."
Angela,"I said, okay."
Kevin,Hmm...
Andy,She said yes! And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing
Kevin,"I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me."
Andy,"I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right."
Jim,"Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere."
Kelly,Can I be your bridesmaid?
Holly,Damn it!
Angela,No.
Michael,"Hello, Holly. Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually."
Dwight,Well... it's my own fault.
Holly,"Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights."
Andy,Tuna! [hugs Jim
Michael,"And the sequel, ""Woman Stands at Desk and Works."" So, I have no idea how you, how you sit like that."
Jim,"I know. That's awesome, man. That's great."
Holly,Yoga.
Andy,Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
Michael,Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Um...
Toby,"Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us."
Holly,"Pass curvy metal piece, you will."
Pam,"Oh, yeah, um..."
Michael,"So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town."
Toby,"Yeah, could we..."
Holly,"Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!"
Pam,"Sure. Meredith, do you mind?"
Michael,Kidding. Acting!
Toby,This one right here.
Holly,Acting!
Meredith,Okay. One two three- Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
Michael,Acting!
Toby,"It's digital, so just take as many as you want."
Holly,Lovitz.
Meredith,"One, two three- One, two, three-"
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,"I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight..."
Michael,I did it!
Holly,Hey there.
Jim,What'd you do?
Michael,Hey.
Michael,"I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point."
Holly,So you missed something really big.
Jim,"Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?"
Michael,Yeah?
Michael,It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
Holly,"Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants."
Jim,"Oh, I'm so glad you didn't."
Michael,"Oh, wow."
Michael,"Whew, oh God. Laying a base. Laying a base..."
Holy,"I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but..."
Jim,"There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!"
Michael,"Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. Oh..."
Michael,Yeah...
Holly,"So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or..."
Michael,"All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up."
Michael,Good luck.
Holly,Yeah.
Dwight,"From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more."
Michael,Is that good?
Michael,"This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days."
Holly,Yeah.
Meredith,What should we do with all these leftovers?
Jim,"Hey, sorry everybody."
Stanley,I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
Michael,"Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her."
Dwight,What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.
Dwight,"No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers."
Dwight,Party's over. You are so busted!
Andy,Wet Tuna!
Creed,I can bring these to my shelter.
Michael,"OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?"
Jim,Hey Dwight.
Stanley,I'm taking my dumplings.
Phyllis,"You said fruit, Michael."
Michael,OK.
Dwight,There. Take those home to your wife.
Michael,And what is that?
Jim,"What's up, Meredith?"
Michael,"Dwight, Dwight!"
Phyllis,Cake.
Meredith,Nothing.
Dwight,"Michael, it's time."
Michael,"You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing."
Dwight,Dripping on me.
Dwight,"Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up."
Dwight,"Happy Birthday, Stanley!"
Michael,"Darryl, would you do the honors?"
Darryl,Don't go breaking my scale.
Holly,"It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off."
Darryl,Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. Sorry guys.
Andy,"I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked."
Kevin,What?
Michael,"Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers."
Holly,Ex-squeeze me.
Creed,Oh nothing.
Stanley,I don't know about anyone else. But it was a good summer for me. I lost seven pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
Michael,"No, I will ex-squeeze you."
Kelly,It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
Toby,"Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica. I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right. I broke my neck. And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now. I still haven't seen the beach. It's nice to have visitors."
Michael,OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
Kelly,I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.
Dwight,Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
Creed,That wasn't a tapeworm.
Jim,"Really, nothing?"
Ryan,How's my favorite branch doing? All right.
Darryl,"2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control."
Michael,"Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him."
Dwight,Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
Ryan,And you got a goatee!
Michael,"Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only."
Michael,I did!
Dwight,Family only.
Ryan,Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Darryl,"All right, got it. 2,210 pounds."
Michael,Yes. Gooooo-tee!
Kevin,"Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?"
Kevin,Firrrrre-duh guy!
Holly,"Almost, Kevin."
Ryan,Hey Kevin... That's really funny.
Pam,"Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200..."
Kevin,Yeah.
Holly,Math is hard.
Ryan,It's great to see you Kev.
Kevin,Yeah.
Kevin,You too.
Pam,"Just, we'll just keep going."
Ryan,"I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list."
Andy,I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
Ryan,Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community.
Oscar,All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Jim,Well that's great. You're talking about your court ordered community service?
Andy,Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
Ryan,I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Oscar,"OK. Stanley, come on."
Jim,"But he did, right?"
Stanley,"Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there."
Ryan,All right.
Stanley,"I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted."
Jim,All right.
Holly,And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head.
Ryan,
Michael,Jimbo.
Darryl,Well you lost zero pounds. No change. On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Jim,"Ah, they moved the shower."
Michael,"Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out."
Michael,Did you see Holly's butt?
Andy,"Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking?"
Jim,"No, I didn't. You know why?"
Holly,"Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?"
Michael,Why?
Andy,NO! I want names!
Jim,"Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts."
Andy,This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life.
Michael,I know.
Oscar,So how was your date?
Jim,But what have you learned about her?
Holly,"Eight point five. I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt. But he's cute, right?"
Michael,"I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read ""Lonesome Dove"" three times."
Michael,
Jim,Nice.
Holly,What's wrong?
Michael,And that her butt refuses to quit!
Michael,Mmm--- mmm... Um...
Jim,"Well, I tried."
Michael,Close the door. This is your fault.
Michael,You have to agree with me. That's insane.
Jim,Nope.
Jim,I'll just go later.
Michael,Your stupid friend zone.
Michael,I thought you had to pee.
Jim,Mmm.
Dwight,
Michael,"I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!"
Oscar,"Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City."
Dwight,Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
Holly,"Oh, thanks. I should check that out."
Jim,"How much weight have you lost, Dwight?"
Oscar,Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
Dwight,"I am hardly the problem, Jim."
Holly,"Actually, I'm a lesbian."
Jim,"No, you're definitely the problem."
Oscar,I'm gay!
Dwight,"This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills."
Holly,I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
Ryan,Kelly.
Oscar,What's the joke?
Kelly,"Oh, hello Ryan. You look well."
Holly,There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
Ryan,"I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed."
Oscar,"Oh, you think it's a choice?"
Kelly,Cool.
Holly,"Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--"
Ryan,We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight?
Oscar,"I'm messing with you, Holly."
Kelly,"Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so..."
Holly,"I knew that. OK, bye."
Ryan,"That--- I, um... cool. Well maybe I'll see you around."
Oscar,OK.
Kelly,It's a small office.
Jim,So you have the directions.
Ryan,Yeah.
Pam,Yes.
Dwight,Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.
Jim,You have a toothbrush.
Phyllis,Yes you were.
Pam,Yes.
Dwight,"But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?"
Jim,You have a cell phone charger.
Phyllis,Split the commission?
Pam,I have everything.
Dwight,Sixty - forty. Hm? I'll drive.
Pam,"Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. What up, 212?"
Ryan,
Dwight,Fax this for me.
Holly,Dieting's only half of it.
Jim,"Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes."
Michael,Mmm-hmm. Saunas.
Dwight,"It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind."
Holly,And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
Andy,"Ang. Ela. Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--"
Michael,"Gah, the dreadmill."
Angela,What?
Jim,"Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers."
Andy,"Hey, check it out. This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper."
Friend,"Oh, my God. Ok. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything."
Andy,Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
Pam,What?
Angela,No. No.
Friend,My ex-girlfriend. She's right behind you. Just... hide me.
Andy,This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
Pam,"Really, where?"
Angela,I don't care.
Friend,No no! Don't look!
Andy,"OK. How do you feel about Maine? I'm on it. I'll see you later, love."
Pam,"Wow, was it the age difference?"
Dwight,"Ahh. We done good in there, half pint."
Friend,"Uh, actually, kind of. Yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early."
Angela,"Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it."
Pam,"Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!"
Dwight,Monkey.
Phyllis,Are you insane?!
Angela,"No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!"
Dwight,"Hey, hey!"
Michael,"Hey, hey! Pam, Pam! Hey!"
Oscar,"Oh my God, what happened?"
Jim,What happened?
Phyllis,There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
Michael,I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
Dwight,"And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!"
Pam,I should really get going.
Phyllis,You left me in a bad part of town!
Michael,"No. OK. Um, the last word is ""seagulls."""
Dwight,"Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? You look great. I can definitely see the difference."
Pam,I'm sure it was really lovely.
Phyllis,Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
Michael,I took a lot from other poems.
Holly,"""...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies. As was clearly stated in the official starting---"""
Jim,Call me when you get in.
Michael,Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
Pam,"OK, bye."
Holly,What are you doing?
Jim,Bye.
Jim,Fair question.
Michael,"All right, call--"
Michael,"I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful."
Pam,"No, Michael."
Michael,It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
Jim,"Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here..."
Michael,Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society.
Michael,"OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week."
Jim,"See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you."
Angela,"It doesn't matter, Michael."
Michael,"If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, ""Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"""
Michael,"Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go."
Kevin,Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
Holly,"Oh, fancy meeting you here."
Michael,How do you know Michael Clump?
Michael,All right.
Oscar,Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
Darryl,"OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds."
Michael,How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
Michael,All right!
Oscar,"I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, ""I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"""
Jim,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork."
Dwight,"No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, ""I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"""
Michael,"I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!"
Michael,"No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man."
Holly,Wikka wikka wikka what?
Dwight,Vamping.
Ronnie,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie."
Michael,"Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?"
Jim,"I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her."
Dwight,"Eh, I've been sitting all day."
Professor,"Sorry I'm late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media."
Michael,We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. Hey. Hey. You shaved?
Pam,I'm in the wrong class...
Ryan,I did.
Professor,Some of you may remember from last semester I am Professor Monaghan. And looks like I'm boring someone already.
Michael,Why?
Pam,"Oh, no. I just--"
Ryan,
Professor,Please sit down.
Professor,"So, in the year 2000, fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave. Some blame it on the new air conditioning system they installed. Some, on the high powered lights. Others feel that fungus is do to an over---"
Holly,You're shaking. Are you all right?
Pam,Nice.
Kelly,Just leave me alone!
Professor,Quiet please.
Kelly,"I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing."
Pam,Sorry.
Ronnie,"Hi, can I help you?"
Friend,Sorry.
Jan,I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
Michael,"Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march."
Kevin,Hi Jan.
Dwight,She should thank me.
Jan,Hi.
Michael,"Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first."
Kevin,How's the candle game?
Phyllis,Why should I have to thank him?
Jan,"Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?"
Michael,"You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok."
Kevin,"Cool. Thank God they found her, too."
Dwight,I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
Jan,"Oh, they found her?"
Michael,"Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? Let's all clap at Phyllis. Ok! When Michael Clump wants to remind you that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly. Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?"
Michael,"Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. Come on. Let's go in."
Ryan,Everything. She's perfect.
Jim,"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father."
Meredith,I like her nails.
Holly,"Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?"
Michael,"Ok, be more specific."
Jan,That's his ex.
Meredith,I like her fingernails.
Holly,"Oh, she's very beautiful."
Phyllis,I like her purple dress.
Oscar,"Yes, she is. And clinically insane."
Michael,What about her looks?
Holly,"So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number."
Creed,Hell of an ass.
Oscar,OK.
Kelly,...what else do people like?
Angela,"Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it."
Phyllis,I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Holly,No! You do not talk to him like that!
Michael,"Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?"
Angela,But he's an idiot!
Kelly,"I hate dieting, I hate it so much. I hate this worm inside of me!"
Kevin,Hey!
Michael,"I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. Mmmmmm."
Holly,He is not an idiot!
Jim,Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer?
Kevin,"Thank you, Holly."
Michael,"Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers."
Holly,He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
Ryan,Oh...
Kevin,"Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?"
Michael,"Ahaha, Yep!"
Holly,"Well, no. Dwight..."
Oscar,How was Friday night?
Angela,"Oh, Holly, that is very offensive."
Holly,"Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so..."
Holly,I'm sorry.
Oscar,He'll call.
Andy,"Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales"
Michael,"Oscar, enough with the girl talk please."
Angela,Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
Darryl,You guys lost four pounds.
Angela,"Hurry, we have to make this fast."
Michael,Hey!
Dwight,Let's do this thing.
Darryl,I say we have a parade.
Angela,Hey!
Dwight,We better.
Angela,"I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8"
Michael,Excellent! Good job.
Jim,"All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this"
Jim,"So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so..."
Pam,I can see you!
Pam,You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you.
Jim,All right!
Jim,I know. I suck.
Pam,This is so cool.
Dwight,"Yes, you do."
Jim,"So what is going on, girl in the computer?"
Jim,"Dwight says ""Hi."""
Pam,Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Dwight,"I do not! I do not say ""Hi"" Pam!"
Jim,Uh-huh.
Jim,"Now he is saying ""Hi"" louder."
Pam,Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
Pam,"I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?"
Dwight,"OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done."
Jim,Umm...
Michael,"No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!"
Pam,"No football games, recitals, karate tournaments."
Pam,Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Jim,"Hey, can you go to IM?"
Michael,"Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day."
Pam,OK.
Pam,The nerve.
Jim,OK.
Michael,"Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?"
JIM9334 [screen name],Let's meet for lunch.
Pam,They're on the supply shelf.
Dwight,What are you writing about me?
Michael,Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
Receptionitis15 [screen name],What -- today?
Pam,"New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?"
JIM9334,Yeah. C'mon we'll meet halfway. You'll be back for your 4 o'clock class.
Michael,"OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts."
Dwight,I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
Darryl,"2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back."
Jim,I'm gonna write you up for not working.
Michael,Damn it. Come on.
Dwight,"Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working."
Oscar,Oh!
Receptionitis15,Where?
Kevin,"Oh, my God!"
JIM9334,"The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock."
Dwight,"Come on, Bernard."
Receptionitis15,Alright. See you there.
Michael,Here we go. Everybody on.
Jim,
Dwight,"All right, we're set."
Michael,"Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?"
Darryl,Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
Holly,I just got off... Kendall? I just got off...
Kelly,I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
Michael,"No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?"
Stanley,"I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds."
Holly,"Oh, no."
Phyllis,"Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite."
Micheal,Really?
Phyllis,"Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time."
Holly,No.
Michael,How's it going?
Micheal,Aach.
Phyllis,It's going well.
Holly,And you know what? I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise. Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
Michael,Good.
Michael,"I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco."
Holly,"I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?"
Holly,"Thanks. That's sweet. Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds."
Michael,Cake? Who suggested cake?
Michael,Ugh.
Phyllis,We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Holly,"Well, at least everyone lost weight. That's all that really matters."
Michael,"Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis."
Michael,"Wait, do we have until the end of the day?"
Michael,What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having s*x. And then again for seven years.
Holly,"So we're only eight pounds behind Utica. Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all."
Michael,Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Andy,"Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge."
Dwight,Shotgun weddings.
Andy,Andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
Jim,That's not what that is.
Michael,"Hey, is that healthy food?"
Creed,Fright. Being scared to death.
Kelly,Nope.
Michael,No.
Michael,"We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?"
Holly,Obesity-caused illnesses.
Jim,"Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late."
Dwight,Obesity-caused illnesses.
Michael,"Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?"
Michael,"Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?"
Jim,Perfect.
Jim,I would like to lose 65 pounds.
Dwight,
Michael,"Yes, all right. Who else? Can I put you down for 10 pounds?"
Angela,I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
Angela,No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Andy,Your wish is my command.
Michael,"If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?"
Angela,"Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?"
Jim,Cryogenics. Beer me five.
Andy,Of course!
Michael,This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
Angela,Really?
Jim,"All right, I'm taking off."
Andy,Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know?
Michael,Booty call.
Angela,Mmhmm.
Jim,"Nope, just going to see Pam."
Andy,And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
Michael,Here.
Angela,The guys?
Jim,Maybe put up some shelves.
Andy,I didn't tell you.
Michael,Wait a second. I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
Angela,Mm-mm
Jim,"OK, thank you for ... this."
Andy,"Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em."
Michael,You want more?
Angela,I don't think that...
Jim,No.
Andy,"And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out."
Andy,I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
Angela,I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
Angela,It's not my problem.
Andy,"Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for."
Andy,Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
Angela,Let's talk about this later.
Angela,"That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it."
Andy,Mm-wah!
Andy,"Sweetheart. Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together."
Pam,"Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch."
Andy,Hey-oh!
Jim,
Angela,I know I haven't made this easy on you.
Pam,What are you doing?
Jim,Hi.
Jim,I just... couldn't wait.
Pam,Hi. Mmm. 'Cause--
Pam,Oh my God!
Jim,"Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out."
Jim,"Pam, will you marry me?"
Michael,It's a pretty lame party.
Pam,Oh my God!
Ronnie,Does anyone want to dance?
Jim,So?
Jim,Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
Pam,Yes!
Phyllis,"Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake."
Dwight,God. Where is Jim?
Stanley,I don't like cake anymore
Holly,I'm calling it. I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Andy,"Why not, dawg?"
Michael,"Aww, really?"
Stanley,Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
Holly,Yeah.
Dwight,"Michael, we have a situation."
Michael,"I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing..."
Dwight,They should not be in that room.
Holly,Yeah?
Holly,That's so lame they didn't invite us.
Michael,...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
Michael,You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
Holly,"Aww man, I really wanted to see them."
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,I know. I love Counting Crows.
Michael,Let's go mini-golfing.
Holly,Look at where my seats were.
Holly,"Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight."
Michael,"Wow, really?"
Michael,Uh...
Holly,Yeah.
Holly,"It'll probably be a total disaster, but..."
Michael,That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you.
Michael,"Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time."
Holly,"Michael, you don't have to buy them."
Dwight,Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
Michael,"I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do."
Michael,You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
Holly,Ok.
Holly,Really?
Michael,Ok?
Michael,Yeah.
Holly,Yeah.
Holly,"Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck."
Michael,"Alright. Alright! Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so..."
Pam,"Well, I should go."
Jim,Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Pam,"No, don't. I'm mad at them."
Jim,"Why, what happened?"
Pam,Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Jim,Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
Pam,What? Why not?
Jim,"I just didn't, you know, want a deal."
Pam,"Come on, it won't be that bad."
Jim,"OK. You know what? Here we go. Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged."
Pam,Hi everyone!
Oscar,I thought you were already engaged.
Jim,Nope.
Angela,That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.
Jim,Thank you Angela.
Kevin,I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?
Jim,Yes.
Andy,"A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?"
Jim,To get married.
Dwight,"She's not a virgin, you know."
Pam,Wow.
Michael,What's going on?
Pam,"No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi."
Creed,The tall guy got engaged.
Michael,To be married?
Jim,Yep.
Pam,Sorry.
Holly,"Pencils down! Just kidding, take your time."
Holly,"Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder."
Dwight,"I got it, I got it."
Michael & Holly,Let's get ethical! Ethical! I wanna get ethical! Let's get into Ethics yeah! Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk! Your body talk. Let me hear your body talk.
Michael,WOO! Alright!
Michael,"""Why are you helping her? You're not even dating."" She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh..."
Michael,"Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax!"
Holly,"Thanks Michael. Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired."
Kevin,"Oh come on! He's right there. He was hired. Oh check it out, ""Hired Guy."""
Jim,Nice.
Ryan,"Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six? Anyone know Joanna on that show? In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So..."
Michael,"Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy."
Holly,"Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree."
Phyllis,I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Holly,Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Michael,"Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic."
Holly,"Thank you. In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing."
Kelly,What?
Holly,"Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?"
Stanley,This meeting.
Andy,Hey-oh!
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,Can't set 'em up like that.
Kelly,"Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. I don't care."
Meredith,I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Holly,Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Michael,Can we have a moment? Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
Dight,Michael.
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Michael,"Do some... do some work. People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan."
Holly,"Well, I just have to get through the binder."
Michael,Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
Holly,I am?
Micheal,"Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out."
Holly,"Ok. Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right."
Michael,"Lauren, enough with the pencils."
Holly,"No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing."
Oscar,That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Andy,I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
Oscar,"Exactly, Andy."
Andy,"Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, twice. No big deal."
Dwight,"It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male."
Andy,No that's... not how it works.
Michael,I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.
Holly,"Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace."
Michael,"Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on."
Oscar,Pass.
Michael,I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
Holly,What was the dilemma?
Michael,To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
Holly,Oh--- no no no.
Michael,"Yeah,. Come on, anybody. Let it fly."
Oscar,"Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch."
Michael,A siesta!
Dwight,Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!
Jim,"Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?"
Dwight,Never!
Michael,You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?
Kelly,Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Michael,Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?
Holly,"No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that."
Michael,Mmm...
Angela,"I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it."
Michael,"Well, let's keep this party movin' on."
Meredith,"I'll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?"
Michael,Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Meredith,Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Jim,Jackpot.
Michael,Ach! Wuh---
Holly,"Meredith, that is serious. I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods."
Meredith,"Exchange of steak. Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?"
Michael,"That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate."
Holly,"Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith."
Michael,Oh...
Holly,I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
Micheal,Nnyeah. What ya gonna do?
Holly,"So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?"
Meredith,"Liaisons, you mean meet-ups? I don't know, once a month for six years. Something like that."
Michael,"Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around."
Meredith,Am I in trouble here or something?
Michael,"No... no, this is just a stupid formality."
Holly,"No, it's not a formality. Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal? Unrelated to business?"
Meredith,"Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper. There's not a lot of fruit in those looms."
Micheal,Ughh! For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag.
Holly,"What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons? I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?"
Meredith,"Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity?"
Holly,Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
Meredith,Well... I'm not quitting.
Jim,Yawn. Four seconds.
Dwight,What are you doing?
Jim,Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Dwight,"Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. Really? Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti---"
Jim,Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.
Dwight,There is no way that that was---
Jim,One second.
Michael,"Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk."
Holly,It's Mike-raculous.
Michael,"Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out."
Holly,Sounds good.
Michael,Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Holly,Oh I already bought this...
Michael,"Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical."
Holly,"So, I've gone over corporate policy."
Michael,What do you think? What do you think of this place?
Holly,"Oh, it's very nice."
Michael,"Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?"
Holly,Mmm.
Michael,"Wow, that sounds so... warm."
Holly,In Summer.
Michael,Here too. You know what my favorite season is?
Holly,Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Michael,"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons."
Holly,"Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated."
Michael,"Wow, terminator, terminator."
Holly,I'm from da future.
Michael,Yeah.
Jim,"Hey, Andy."
Andy,Yo.
Jim,"By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?"
Andy,"No, I did not. Was that any good?"
Jim,Actually not. It was really so-so.
Dwight,Ok.
Jim,"I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?"
Andy,Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
Jim,"You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake."
Andy,"Really? Huh, that's cool."
Jim,Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
Andy,Really? That doesn't sound right.
Michael,"I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money."
Holly,"Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules."
Michael,"Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her."
Holly,We punish her?
Michael,"Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months."
Holly,I don't think we could enforce that.
Michael,"I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key."
Holly,A chastity belt.
Michael,"No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the..."
Jim,He has not stopped working for a second. At 12
Michael,I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
Holly,"No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened."
Michael,Yes.
Holly,What am I saying?
Michael,Well... bleh busted. I don't...
Holly,I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Michael,"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family."
Holly,It's not a family. It's a workplace.
Michael,I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers.
Jim,19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
Dwight,None of your business.
Jim,So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Dwight,Fine.
Jim,So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
Dwight,"Yes, maybe I'm not."
Holly,It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over.
Ryan,Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Michael,What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Ryan,Two HR reps.
Michael,You get me.
Holly,Can I sit?
Michael,"I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man."
Kendall,"Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with.."
Holly,"Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar."
Michael,Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
Kendall,"Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action."
Holly,"Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical."
Kendall,"Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that."
Holly,"Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it."
Kendall,"I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training."
Holly,"No, I understand."
Kendall,Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion.
Holly,No. I can do it.
Kendall,Good.
Michael,"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, ""I told you so."" Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way."
Holly,"Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar."
Andy,"No way, lady."
Kevin,It's a trap.
Holly,"Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training."
Meredith,Don't sign anything.
Michael,"Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you."
Stanley,It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Michael,Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it!
Meredith,Am I getting fired?
Michael,"Now is really not the time, Meredith."
Holly,"In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible."
Phyllis,"Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious."
Meredith,"Hey, where is the steak sauce?"
Kevin,I think we're out.
Meredith,I got some in my minivan somewhere.
Andy,"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?"
Kevin,"I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash."
Phyllis,I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.
Stanley,Amen. Just keep the ribs coming.
Dwight,Hey Michael?
Michael,"Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine."
Michael,Yeah.
Jan,Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you... soon.
Dwight,Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
Michael,All right.
Michael,"OK, just remember to keep breathing."
Jan,OK.
Dwight,My cervix is ripening.
Holly,You still gonna be mean to me?
Michael,"OK, good."
Michael,You wanna go out?
Jim,"Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through delusion."
Holly,Yes.
Dwight,Michael! My water's breaking!
Michael,"I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly."
Michael,"Oh, OK! OK!"
Jim,"Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message."
Dwight,Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Pam,Hi.
Michael,I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
Pam,"Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message."
Dwight,Right. Highways or surface roads?
Jim,"Hey, it's me. It is 5"
Michael,I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
Pam,"I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but..."
Dwight,"No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!"
Jim,You must be out or something.
Michael,"I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby."
Pam,I'll leave a message.
Dwight,It's about adapting to the circumstances.
Jim,"Is it me, or are we just a little off today?"
Michael,"Andy, would you like to have my baby?"
Pam,I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.
Andy,Yes! Yeah. Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Jim,Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
Dwight,"No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa!"
Pam,I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
Michael,"All right, OK. Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!"
Jim,Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Dwight,The pressure! The pressure!
Pam,"And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?"
Michael,"Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out."
Jim,"Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe."
Dwight,Aaaaaaaa!
Pam,"You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home."
Michael,Aaaaaaaa!
Jim,"Wish you were home. Uh, anyway..."
Dwight,"Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision."
Pam,"Anyway, um... I miss you."
Michael,Just keep pushing...
Jim,I miss you.
Dwight,Hold me!
Michael,I'm right here.
Dwight,Cradle my head!
Michael,"I'm right here, I'm right here."
Dwight,"I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!"
Michael,All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
Dwight,Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Michael,"Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late."
Dwight,No! I don't want natural!
Michael,No. You have to just push it out!
Dwight,OK!
Michael,Keep simulating.
Dwight,Aaaaaaaa!
Michael,OK!
Dwight,Do you have the Sharpie?!
Michael,Keep simulating.
Dwight,Do you have the Sharpie?!
Michael,"Yes, I do!"
Dwight,"OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy."
Michael,OK.
Dwight,Ready?!
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,Aaaaaaaa!
Michael,Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Dwight,Butter. Newborns are slippery.
Michael,Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.
Michael,It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
Michael,"Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks?"
Phyllis,No.
Michael,"Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry. Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?"
Angela,"Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name ""Chevy."" And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name ""Astird."""
Phyllis,That can't be right.
Angela,"Michael wrote down ""Astird."""
Michael,She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
Meredith,Ass...turd.
Michael,"I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?"
Michael,"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens."
Phyllis,"Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower."
Kevin,"But Phyllis, it's not his baby."
Phyllis,"I know, Kevin."
Oscar,Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Phyllis,"Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake."
Phyllis,"I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine."
Michael,"Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them."
Phyllis,Sorry.
Michael,"Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. Pump it!"
Pam,"So you know Stacy, right?"
Jim,"Right, the one from England."
Pam,"There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages."
Jim,"Oh. Right, that style."
Pam,"So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab."
Jim,OK...
Pam,"Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in."
Jim,"Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?"
Pam,"No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres."
Jim,OK.
Pam,"So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, ""No way. You can't reserve seats."" And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box."
Jim,No... way!
Pam,Yes!
Jim,Ha ha. That's hilarious?
Pam,"No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested."
Jim,"Who, Stacy?"
Pam,"No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me?"
Jim,Uh...
Pam,"Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting."
Jim,"OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. That was a good story."
Dwight,Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Andy,Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here?
Angela,It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
Andy,Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
Angela,That's Phyllis.
Andy,Well -
Angela,"Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert."
Andy,"Why would that make me a pervert, I -"
Angela,"Well, it does. That's me."
Andy,That's not you.
Angela,Yes it is.
Andy,"That's mean, come on, that's -"
Michael,"Ahoy, matey."
Holly,Ahoy.
Michael,"Ahoy. So, how you doin'?"
Holly,Good.
Michael,"Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way."
Holly,Of course. Yeah.
Stanley,"I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?"
Jim,Jan.
Jan,"Hi, Jim!"
Jim,What do we have here?
Jan,This is my baby.
Jim,Really...
Dwight,Oh no...
Dwight,Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.
Michael,So this is Astird.
Jan,Astrid.
Michael,"Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?"
Jan,"Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-"
Michael,I could have helped.
Jan,"And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so..."
Michael,"Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways."
Jan,"OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's..."
Michael,"No, I don't!"
Jan,"I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet."
Michael,Can I hold her?
Jan,"Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah."
Michael,"All right, OK."
Michael,"I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion."
Michael,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office"
Jan,trid.
Michael,"...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life."
Jan,Well...
Michael,"Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. Lion King!"
Jan,"Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high. I'll take that."
Michael,"OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop."
Holly,You OK? You seem kind of...
Michael,"I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in."
Michael,Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
Kevin,"Michael, the baby's already been born."
Michael,"Uh, duh."
Kevin,So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Michael,"No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do."
Kevin,OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Michael,"All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes."
Jan,Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
Michael,Whatta we got?
Angela,"Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller."
Michael,Oh!
Jan,Thank you.
Michael,She already has a stroller.
Kelly,And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Oscar,She's got an Orbit
Dwight,Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Michael,"OK, what else?"
Dwight,"Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible."
Jan,Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
Pam,Hey you!
Jim,Hey! You busy?
Pam,Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
Jim,"OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and everyone's just staring at her."
Pam,"I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-"
Jim,"The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!"
Pam,I can't hear anything!
Jim,"Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later."
Pam,OK.
Pam,"I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick."
Jan,How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
Dwight,"Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!"
Dwight,Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
Dwight,Playtime is over!
Andy,"So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth."
Jan,"Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing."
Angela,You gave birth in a tub?
Jan,"Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb."
Kelly,"Um, so you're in the tub with everything?"
Jan,"Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah."
Creed,Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Jan,"Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed."
Creed,Ugh.
Stanley,I'm done.
Oscar,Me too.
Jan,And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.
Michael,"Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this."
Michael,I could have helped.
Jan,"You're sad about this. I know that, and I wish that I... but... would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?"
Michael,"Uh, yeah."
Jan,"All right. Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes. I'm exhausted, so um. Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in twenty."
Michael,"I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged."
Michael,Phyllis? Could you take-.
Michael,Hey guys.
Darryl,"What's up, Mike?"
Michael,"Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another."
Darryl,You a baby daddy?
Michael,"Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?"
Darryl,Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.
Michael,I just saw this baby daddy-
Darryl,"You should stop calling yourself ""baby daddy."""
Michael,"Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?"
Darryl,"Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby."
Michael,Well-
Darryl,You feel connected to his baby over there?
Michael,It's- that's different.
Darryl,You feel connected to this?
Michael,That's not a baby.
Darryl,"You want to hold me, to see how you feel?"
Michael,Could I?
Darryl,No.
Jan,Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
Holly,I can imagine.
Jan,Where's Astrid?
Holly,"Oh, I think she's on a sales call."
Jan,On a what?
Holly,"Waaa! More paper! Waaa! No, she's just on a coffee break."
Jan,That's funny.
Holly,She's with Angela.
Angela,"That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready?"
Andy,OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook!
Angela,"Now. Come on, up here!"
Andy,Look up here!
Angela,Your hand's in it.
Andy,What? Sorry.
Angela,"Yeah, that's a good one."
Jan,What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
Andy,We're taking a picture.
Jan,There you are.
Andy,She's nature's bounty.
Jan,You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that?
Jan,"Michael, I need your help."
Michael,"I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt."
Jan,Uh... come on.
Dwight,I like to call this... the bumper test.
Michael,Sure you can't stay a little longer?
Jan,"Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go."
Michael,"All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving."
Jan,"You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?"
Dwight,Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Jan,"Ah. Thanks, Dwight."
Jan,"OK. You know what? There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me."
Michael,OK?
Jan,Don't date Holly.
Receptionist,"Pam, line three."
Michael,"325, 325."
Pam,"Okay, thanks."
David Wallace,350
Pam,"New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate."
Michael,350
Pam,Hey.
Dwight,350 and one penny.
Michael [on phone],Paaam-o-laaaaaa...
Michael,350 and one penny.
Pam,"Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week."
Bob,400
Pam,Hey Michael.
Michael,"400, 400 hey batter batter."
Michael [on phone],Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
Dwight,400 and one penny.
Michael,Hey.
Michael,400 and one penny.
Holly,Hello.
Bob,500
Michael,That was really fun last night.
Michael,500
Holly,"Yeah, it was nice."
Dwight,500 and one penny.
Michael,I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Michael,500 and one penny. One million dollar!
Holly,"Oh, that would be great. You need that."
Bob,700
Michael,Yeah?
Michael,700
Holly,Yeah.
Dwight,700 and one penny.
Michael,Oh really?
Michael,Humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-
Holly,Yeah.
Bob,"1,000"
Michael,Well...
Dwight,"Eh, it's not worth it."
Holly,It would help.
Michael,"1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. Nicely done."
Michael,"I, uh... I let her win."
Jim,No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And we are not that couple.
Holly,"No, he didn't."
Michael,"Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them-"
Michael,"So, when, um, can I see you again?"
Holly,"The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true."
Holly,"Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager?"
David Wallace,"No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly."
Michael,No.
Holly,"I don't care, free tonight."
Michael,"Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. Because I am busy taking you out."
Holly,"Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight."
Michael,Why?
Holly,I'm going out with you.
Michael,"Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight..."
Holly,No more.
Michael,Tonight's so...
Holly,No more.
Michael,"Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day."
Holly,"Thank you, you too."
Michael,You're welcome.
Michael,"In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have s*x. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure."
Andy,"That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date."
Dwight,You set a date?
Andy,"J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money."
Phyllis,What are you making?
Dwight,A knife.
Phyllis,You're making a knife with a knife?
Dwight,You got a better way?
Phyllis,You want to talk about it?
Dwight,About what?
Phyllis,You know I know. You know they know.
Dwight,"I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know."
Holly,"Oh, the mall could be fun."
Michael,Yeah.
Holly,We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Michael,"Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after. Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?"
Holly,...Hell yeah.
Michael,"Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first."
Holly,"Yeah, that's good."
Michael,Probably get soup or something light.
Phyllis,Hi.
Dwight,"She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine."
Phyllis,It's nice to learn new things.
Dwight,I was talking to myself.
Phyllis,Okay.
Dwight,I just don't get it.
Phyllis,What don't you get?
Dwight,Why is she marrying Andy?
Phyllis,Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
Dwight,That's really fattening.
Phyllis,"No, it's lettuce."
Holly,It's time to go.
Michael,No. No. Reservations are at 8
Holly,"You're crazy, go crazy."
Holly,"Oh, I forgot my keys."
Michael,Do you need 'em?
Holly,"Yeah, lets go grab them."
Michael,All right.
Holly,"Oh, after vous."
Michael,Thank vous. What? Oh!
Holly,"I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?"
Michael,Not if we turn these dials all the way down. Now they can't hear us at all.
Holly,"Oh, good."
Michael,We're totally alone.
Angela,"Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000."
Oscar,"Great, they stole my laptop."
Kevin,"Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector."
Oscar,How does that even compare?
Kevin,"Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges."
Michael,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
Jim,We were robbed last night.
Dwight,"Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have."
Holly,Can I talk to you for a second?
Michael,Yeah. Oh... oh!
Holly,"That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?"
Michael,"No, did you?"
Holly,Michael I think this is our fault.
Michael,"Oh, no, my God."
Holly,Oh...
Michael,Oh my God!
Michael,So much for s*x without consequences.
Pam [on phone],You are such a dork! Shots!
Jim,"So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3"
Pam [on phone],I'm not drunk.
Jim,I'm on minute six of this message.
Pam [on phone],"Okay, I do not sound like that."
Man on phone,You can take the girl out of Philly...
Pam [on phone],Scranton.
Jim,The future mother of my children.
Angela,I never felt safe here.
Andy,"You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind."
Angela,I would very much like that.
Andy,Yeah?
Angela,Yeah.
Andy,Consider yourself... at home!
Dwight,Ugh.
Dwight,Get in.
Phyllis,Where are we going?
Dwight,"I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so."
Phyllis,"Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on."
Dwight,Are you sure that's going to work?
Phyllis,It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
Dwight,"Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight..."
Holly,How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
Oscar,I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Creed,Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? Creed Bratton.
Michael,"We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?"
Michael,"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty."
Phyllis,I think it's a fun idea.
Michael,Thank you.
Phyllis,We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Michael,"Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?"
Phyllis,"Move on, Michael."
Michael,"Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days."
Oscar,"So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?"
Michael,"I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-"
Jim,Do you need us for any of this?
Michael,Do I?
Holly,Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Michael,"Yeah, I think that's pretty boss."
Holly,He knows how to get things. He got me.
Michael,Whoa!
Holly,Sorry.
Michael,Twice. ... Right?
Holly,Mm-hmm.
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Holly,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,"Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this."
Angela,I think you have me confused with another person.
Dwight,I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6
Angela,I heard you.
Michael,"Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!"
Darryl,"Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People."
Michael,"Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400- Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 Sold! For 300 dollars to me! What the hell is that?"
Phyllis,It's the only gavel I could find.
Michael,"It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!"
Darryl,"Hey Mike, do my thing."
Michael,"Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-"
Darryl,"Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest."
Jim,5 dollars.
Darryl,Sold! To Jim.
Michael,"Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says ""Creed."""
Creed,"Yeah, that's all-inclusive."
Darryl,She thought I was McNabb.
Jim,I can see that.
Darryl,"Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?"
Jim,"Another round, boys? Great."
Roy,Halpert?
Darryl,"What's up, Roy?"
Jim,Hey man.
Roy,I'm not gonna hit you or anything.
Jim,"Oh, I wouldn't-"
Roy,You good?
Jim,I'm good. How you doing?
Roy,I'm good.
Jim,"Yeah, okay."
Roy,"Hey Darryl, what's happenin'?"
Darryl,"Oh, what's up, Roy?"
Roy,"Hey, what's up, guys? How you been?"
Kevin,"Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes."
Michael,"Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man."
Kevin,Federal and State.
Michael,Federal and State.
Kevin,Fine.
Michael,"Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage."
Hank [the security guard],Me and the blues. It's me and the blues.
Michael,"We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!"
David Wallace,Hey.
Michael,Hey!
David Wallace,"Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!"
Oscar,100 dollars.
Michael,"100 dollars, great."
Bob,125
Guy in audience,140
Dwight,"Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick."
Phyllis,Oh dear.
Michael,Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
Guy in audience,160
Michael,160
Dwight,I had to get your attention. This is an emergency.
Phyllis,Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Dwight,"Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?"
Phyllis,Now you move on.
Dwight,"Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?"
Phyllis,"Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer."
Dwight,"Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan."
Phyllis,"Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us."
Dwight,Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. And you slap like a girl.
Dwight,What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me.
Roy,What's going on with Pam?
Jim,"Oh, she's good actually."
Roy,Yeah?
Jim,"She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school."
Roy,Really?
Jim,"Yeah, she's doing really well."
Roy,Huh.
Jim,"She's engaged, um... to me."
Roy,"Congrats, man."
Jim,"Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that."
Roy,So Pam's happy?
Jim,"Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8"
Roy,Wow.
Jim,What?
Roy,I thought you were a friend.
Jim,I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.
Bob,When are you getting to Bruce?
Michael,"Uh, just a few more items."
All,Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!
Michael,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?"
Stanley,Do you want us to look for 'em?
Michael,"No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody."
Phyllis,I have my hug.
Michael,"Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so."
Bob,I'll bid on a hug.
Michael,"She's your wife, you idiot."
Bob,100 dollars.
David Wallace,200
Michael,"Uh, what the hell is happening?"
Andy,250
Angela,What are you doing?
Andy,"I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one."
Angela,Not here.
Bob,300
Michael,"300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice."
Dwight,300 and one penny.
Michael,"300 and one penny, 300 and one penny."
Bob,325
Kelly,"Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween."
Dwight,Will end completely!
Phyllis,Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Andy,Will end completely!
Kelly,"Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from s*x And The City."
Dwight,"That is all sir, you may go."
Phyllis,Mm. I like your shoes.
Darryl,"There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp."
Kelly,Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
Pam,"For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better."
Phyllis,Sure.
Jim,"Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?"
Ryan,"I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing."
Pam,"Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle."
Kelly,"Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?"
Jim,That is good.
Ryan,Gordon Gekko.
Pam,Thank you.
Kelly,"Oh, from the insurance commercials!"
Jim,"Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. Oh, text message from my brother. ""Pam cool. Welcome to the family."""
Ryan,... Yeah.
Pam,Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Oscar,Whoa. Awesome.
Darryl,This is the last of it.
Creed,Let's put a smile on that face!
Michael,"Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck."
Kevin,Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
Darryl,You're not staying?
Andy,"Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?"
Michael,"You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you."
Jim,Dave.
Darryl,But you want me to put it back in the truck.
Andy,Cool.
Michael,I'll be down in just a second. Holly?
Jim,You are? A cat?
Michael,So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl Okay. Goodbye.
Andy,"We were looking for ""kitten."""
Holly,Okay. Bye.
Jim,"Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert."
Darryl,I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
Pam,Hey.
Michael,We didn't break up.
Jim,"Hey New York, Happy Halloween!"
Darryl,"Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues."
Pam,Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention.
Michael,Okay.
Pam,"So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler."
Darryl,Da na na na na... da na na na na...
Dwight,Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! Disappear.
Michael,That's a really pretty song.
Michael,"Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets."
Darryl,"Da na na na na. No, no, check it out, look. Da na na na na... want to do that?"
Holly,"Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire."
Darryl,"That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?"
Holly,Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
Michael,Okay.
Michael,Road trip! Right?
Darryl,Da na na na na.
Holly,"Breaker one-nine, copy?"
Michael,Da na na na na.
Michael,"Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again."
Darryl,Da na na na na.
Darryl,Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
Michael,Da na na na na.
Michael,We're not.
Darryl,"No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da na na na na."
Holly,Kidding.
Michael,Da na na na na.
Michael,We're not doing anything.
Darryl,Da na na na na.
Holly,"It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said ""Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?"" And he said ""I asked you first."" And I said ""First!"" at the same time he did. And then I said ""Jinx."" And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So..."
Michael,Da na na na na.
Michael,"All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge."
Darryl,Da na na na na!!
Jim,"Oh, I'll walk you out."
Michael,Da na na na na!!
Michael,"Ah, you are quite the gentleman."
Darryl,Da na na na na .
Michael,You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
Michael,Da na na na na.
Jim,All right. We'll see. No.
Darryl,Yeah! Da na na na na.
Jim,"I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two."
Michael,Da na na na na.
Dwight,Good morning temp.
Darryl,YEAH! Da na na na na.
Ryan,'Morning. Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Michael,Da na na na na...
Dwight,Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?
Andy,"I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?"
Andy,Ha ha ha. That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.
Dwight,Where did you get those?
Dwight,Andy.
Andy,"What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state."
Andy,"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them."
Dwight,I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Dwight,"No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!"
Andy,"Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?"
Andy,"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?"
Dwight,Cornell.
Dwight,"Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine."
Phyllis,I'm sitting right here Dwight.
Dwight,"I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy."
Dwight,"Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it."
Holly,I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
Michael,Cool!
Darryl,Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
Michael,"We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song."
Michael and Holly,"Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long."
"Michael, Holly, and Darryl","If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way..."
Dwight,"Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong."
Andy,"Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying ""we."" You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me."
Dwight,"Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage."
Andy,"I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red."
Dwight,"Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this."
Pam,Hey!
Tom,"Hey, future baby sis!"
Pam,How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
Tom,I'm good.
Pam,"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, ""That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best."""
Pam,"Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it."
Pete,That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Tom,"Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!"
Pete,"That, is awesome!"
Tom,"Like she basically has a hobby, for a job."
Pete,Oh yeah.
Pam,"So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?"
Pete,I think this is better.
Tom,"The other thing would ""get"" Jim."
Pete,"This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!"
Pam,"Okay, okay."
Tom,"Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends."
Pam,Oookay....
Pam,They came up with that idea really fast.
Darryl,This trip was longer than I thought.
Holly,Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
Michael,Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
Holly,You were sleeping? You were talking before.
Michael,Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
Darryl,Not really.
Michael,"All right. What's the scoop, how far?"
Darryl,Four hours. Almost halfway there.
Holly,We're only halfway?
Michael,"Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast."
Darryl,Next exit isn't for five miles.
Holly,Let's check there.
Pam,Hey guys.
Jim,"Hey, how are you?"
Pam,Hi!
Jim,Good to see you.
Pete,"Nice to see you again, Pam."
Tom,"Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long!"
Jim,All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
Darryl,There's nothing out here man.
Michael,"Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon."
Michael,"Here we go, fourth time's a charm. ""Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... Hey. Are you crying?"
Holly,No.
Michael,Allergies?
Holly,No.
Michael,Did Darryl touch you?
Darryl,WHAT!?
Holly,"No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?"
Michael,What's the matter?
Holly,It's not gonna work.
Michael,Sure it is.
Holly,There's too much distance.
Michael,"Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine."
Holly,Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
Michael,Listen to me. I like you so much.
Holly,And I like you too.
Michael,And I've dated four women in the last--
Holly,I've dated four guys last year too.
Michael,Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
Holly,Oh.
Michael,"I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid."
Holly,Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
Michael,That's what she said.
Michael,"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be."
Andy,Take that down.
Dwight,Excuse me?
Andy,Take. That down.
Meredith,You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Andy,I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
Creed,It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
Andy,"It's pronounced ""Corn-ell!"" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!"
Dwight,"Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work."
Andy,Fine.
Dwight,What do you say?
Andy,"Yeah, good. Can we--- Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!"
Holly,"If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?"
Michael,Yeah.
Holly,And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
Michael,"Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way."
Holly,Oh.
Michael,"I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road."
Holly,Well-
Michael,Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
Holly,How long could we keep that up?
Michael,Years!
Holly,Years?
Michael,Yeah.
Holly,Years? Of just a few hours every weekend?
Michael,"Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy."
Holly,Thank you.
Michael,"My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy."
Darryl,"Clever, Mike."
Tom,"So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?"
Pete,"Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?"
Jim,That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Tom,Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.
Jim,"Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?"
Pete,"Hey, just having fun Jimmy."
Tom,Yeah. Right Pam?
Pam,Yup!
Michael,"You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?"
Holly,"I do, I think so."
Michael,Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
Darryl,"Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit."
Michael,I don't know what I'm gonna do!
Darryl,Please call me back.
Michael,Please?
Holly,You'll be okay
Michael,I'm not gonna be okay.
Darryl,Please...
Holly,You will.
Michael,"No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!"
Andy,You might be interested-
Stanley,What?
Andy,Dwight!
Dwight,"Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?"
Andy,"Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview."
Dwight,That's a conflict of interest.
Andy,"Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?"
Dwight,Interview.
Andy,"Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer."
Dwight,What?
Andy,The conference room!
Dwight,Okay.
Andy,Who are your role models?
Andy,"If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance."
Andy,"So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great."
Jim,"Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her."
Pam,Cute.
Jim,That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Tom,"Yup. She only knows how to play ""When the Saints go Marching In."""
Jim,Love that one.
Pete,"Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?"
Jim,Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Pete,Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
Pam,Miles Davis.
Jim,One.
Pam,Chet ...something.
Jim,Half.
Pete,"The point is Pam, is there are jobs-"
Pam,Dizzy Gillespie.
Jim,Also good.
Pete,"And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets."
Tom,You don't!
Jim,Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Pete,I'm just calling it like I see it.
Pam,I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
Jim,"Pam, don't worry about it."
Pam,"I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So..."
Jim,"Guys, what is going on?!"
Tom,We pranked you!
Pete,It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
Pam,... Got you.
Pete,That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Andy,Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
Dwight,Bring it.
Andy,Who was Cornell's eighth president?
Dwight,Dale Raymond Corson!
Andy,"Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills, sub-par."
Dwight,"Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par."
Andy,What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
Dwight,"On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers."
Andy,"Nobody wants ...that, to happen."
Dwight,"Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested."
Andy,"""Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."""
Dwight,"""Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."""
Andy,"""Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations."""
Dwight,"""Interviewer has suspect motives."""
Andy,"""Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."""
Dwight,"""Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth."" Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need."
Andy,I have everything I need-
Dwight,And you will be hearing from the -
Andy,And you will be hearing from -
Dwight,"-Cornell Application Department,"
Andy,which I will not be a part of-
Dwight,And you will not be pleased with the result.
Andy,And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
Dwight,And your affiliation with Cornell -
Andy,And your affiliation with Cornell -
Michael,"Hey, sport."
Jim,Easy.
Dwight,"I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?"
Dwight,OK.
Michael,Ow! God!
Jim,Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
Dwight,"Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!"
Kelly,"You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews."
Darryl,"I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay."
Dwight,"The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved."
Andy,Big idea
Kelly,"Dwight, get out of my nook!"
Michael,"No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam."
Pam,That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
Jim,"Yeah, we'd never do that."
Jim,Good one.
Michael,"Yeah, so there you go."
Jim,"Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way."
Kelly,"Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress."
Kelly,"Yeah, he's weird."
Michael,"Oh, wow, so quickly."
Jim,"Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but..."
Kelly,"Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white."
Kelly,OK.
Kevin,"Michael, did you tell your mom yet?"
Jim,"Hey, how are you and Darryl?"
Michael,Nope. Nope. Not yet.
Kelly,"Um, we're cool. Bye."
Jim,You wouldn't tell your mom?
Jim,Bye.
Kevin,You love your mom.
Pam,That was weird.
Kelly,"Call your mom, Michael."
Jim,What was?
Michael,I'll call her later.
Pam,Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
Group,Call her! Call her!
Jim,"No, actually."
Michael,I don't want to do that. All right. She is going to freak out!
Pam,Did you do something to her?
Andy,Speakerphone!
Jim,I don't think so.
Michael,That's -- thanks.
Pam,"Well, something's off."
Mother,Hello?
Jim,"Hey, how's things?"
Michael,"Mom, I'm getting married."
Ryan,All right.
Mother,"No, you're not."
Jim,Yeah?
Michael,"Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me."
Ryan,Living in the moment.
Mother,"Well, are you getting married?"
Jim,Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
Michael,No.
Ryan,"I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. Can I tell you what else I learned?"
Mother,Are you--
Jim,"Wait, that's pretty weird."
Michael,"I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... Psych."
Ryan,What?
Kelly,"So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100."
Jim,"Well, Andy has a mug just like that."
Michael,And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
Ryan,"Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one."
Kelly,"Yeah, uh, this is all of them"
Jim,No. What party?
Michael,I'll take care of that for you. Thanks.
Ryan,Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
Michael,"Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. ""Schindler's List"" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no."
Jim,I wasn't. But thank you. Do you know anything about this party?
Jim,"Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger."
Pam,"Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead."
Pam,"Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work."
Jim,"Well, I can't be the only one who didn't --"
Jim,Aww.
Jim,
Pam,"It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something."
Jim,"Dwight, let me see your coffee cup."
Jim,"Testing, testing. Hello, everybody."
Dwight,No.
Pam,"We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone."
Jim,Is that it?
Alex,"Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?"
Dwight,No. Why? No.
Jim and Pam,Sprinkle of cinnamon.
Jim,"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing"
Pam,I should go.
Dwight,"Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?"
Michael,"Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did."
Jim,Probably just Kelly.
Dwight,Bring it on.
Dwight,Obviously. I knew it.
Michael,No.
Jim,That's what I'm saying.
Dwight,Sorry.
Dwight,Yeah. What?
Michael,Wow.
Jim,You were right.
Dwight,What does it say?
Dwight,I was -- I was right.
Michael,"Dwight, your feedback is horrible."
Jim,You were right.
Dwight,That's impossible.
Dwight,I was right.
Michael,A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
Jim,You knew it.
Dwight,I sell more paper than anyone.
Dwight,I knew it.
Michael,"No, no, no, no, no."
Jim,"You knew it the whole time, buddy."
Dwight,"Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes."
Dwight,"I knew it the whole time, buddy!"
Michael,Do I look like I am joking?
Jim,Wow.
Dwight,"No, but that's sometimes part of it."
Dwight,Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Michael,"If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?"
Pam,Right Dwight is loud.
Dwight,Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
Dwight,I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head
Michael,You're not.
Jim,"No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this."
Andy,"Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?"
Kelly,What's going on?
Jim,Nope.
Michael,Why don't you tell us?
Andy,I got mine. They were really good.
Kelly,Nothing's going on.
Pam,I miss him.
Dwight,"Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit."
Jim,You must be really proud.
Michael,Dwight. I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
Andy,"Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug."
Kelly,What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
Jim,"Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here."
Dwight,"Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake."
Andy,"Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one."
Jim,"We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks."
Jim,"OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use uh, oh -- Snoopy."
Michael,What's going on?
Pam,Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
Kelly,"I love your tie, Michael."
Andy,It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
Michael,Kelly.
Jim,How can you even be sure?
Kelly,I was raped.
Andy,It has my face on it.
Michael,"You cannot say ""I was raped"" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened."
Jim,"Make the face. Yeah, I don't see it."
Kelly,"OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends."
Andy,"Dude, that is my face!"
Dwight,We have our confession. I'm calling security.
Pam,What was that?
Michael,"Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people."
Jim,Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Kelly,See? I wasn't lying.
Pam,Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
Michael,You were lying.
Jim,"It is... more of a spicy brown, actually."
Kelly,I was lying.
Dwight,What are you mumbling about?
Michael,"Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us."
Jim,How was your meeting with Michael?
Dwight,I want to be here when you fire her ass.
Dwight,None of your business.
Michael,I will call you when it is time.
Jim,Was it your scores?
Michael,"I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?"
Dwight,"Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --"
Kelly,No problem.
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Michael,I think you should do that.
Dwight,I'm being sabotaged.
Alex,Pam Beesley?
Jim,Of course.
Pam,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Dwight,And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
Jim,Who's that?
Jim,Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Pam,It's Alex.
Dwight,You're an idiot.
Alex,"It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go."
Jim,There's the charm.
Jim,"Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?"
Michael,"Jimbo, let's do this thang."
Pam,"Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work."
Jim,That is me. Wish me luck.
Alex,"Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?"
Dwight,No way.
Pam,OK.
Pam,Good luck.
Jim,That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Jim,Thanks.
Alex,Um.
Dwight,I didn't say anything
Pam,What's up?
Pam,I love you.
Alex,I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.
Jim,"I love you, too."
Pam,Wow.
Dwight,What do you think I am saying to you?!
Jim,I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
Jim,I'm not talking to you.
Alex,Why did you come to New York in the first place?
Dwight,"I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser."
Pam,"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too."
Andy,"Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work."
Alex,"Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it."
Andy,I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. I got him!
Pam,Jim's in Scranton.
Andy,"Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous."
Alex,"I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway ... I will see you tomorrow."
Michael,"Oh, come on."
Pam,I'll see you tomorrow.
Jim,What?
Alex,OK.
Michael,You too?
Dwight,Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? May I?
Jim,Did my scores drop a little?
Jim,Don't.
Michael,"Jim, they are a poopy."
Dwight,Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
Pam,Jim? Jim?
Andy,"We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers."
Jim,Are we even sure that's my file?
Dwight,"Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?"
Michael,"No. Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --"
Andy,Oh. Hmm.
Jim,"Well, there's got to be an explanation."
Dwight,"While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night."
Michael,I agree.
Andy,That's very generous.
Jim,Yeah.
Dwight,"While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands."
Michael,So let's see what we can find out from reading. Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
Andy,"Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal!"
Jim,I think you mean smug
Dwight,OK.
Michael,Arrogance.
Andy,"Um, what are we talking price wise?"
Jim,"Michael, I'm just trying to --"
Dwight,You already said deal.
Michael,And there's our smudgeness.
Angela,Pay him whatever he wants.
Jim,"I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year."
Andy,Can't argue with that. Dwight ... You are going to make us so happy.
Pam,Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Jim,A little bit. ... Worth it.
Michael,"Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?"
Jim,Microgement.
Michael,"Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go."
Dwight,"All right, fine. Brrring."
Jim,Hello?
Dwight,"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company."
Jim,"Wow, that's great, because I need paper."
Dwight,"Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything."
Jim,"Wow, this is my lucky day."
Michael,Ask him his name.
Dwight,"What is your name, sir?"
Jim,I am Bill Buttlicker.
Dwight,"Really, that's your real name?"
Jim,"How dare you? My family built this country, by the way."
Michael,"Be respectful, Dwight."
Dwight,"Yes, Michael."
Jim,Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Dwight,"What? No, but I --"
Jim,"Hello? No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK."
Michael,It's up to you to change his mind.
Jim,Sorry. That was a family emergency.
Dwight,"Oh, no. What's wrong?"
Jim,You know what? That's private.
Michael,"Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!"
Dwight,"Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--"
Jim,"Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing."
Michael,He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Dwight,"OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --"
Jim,You're gonna have to talk louder.
Dwight,"OK, our prices have never been lower."
Jim,"Son, you have to talk louder."
Dwight,...never been lower!
Jim,"Louder, son!"
Dwight,Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
Michael,Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight,He --
Michael,That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
Jim,"Now, you listen to me, sir."
Michael,Here we go.
Jim,"The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult."
Michael,Give me the phone.
Dwight,"Please, Mr. Buttlicker --"
Jim,I'm irate right now.
Michael,Give me the phone.
Dwight,Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Michael,Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Dwight,I have to put you on with my boss.
Jim,"Well, I should hope so. Who is this?"
Michael,"Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager."
Jim,"Well, this is William M. Buttlicker."
Michael,"Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?"
Jim,"Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today."
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,"See how it's done? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. See what I did?"
Dwight,You are the master.
Jim,"There is one condition, Michael."
Michael,Yes.
Jim,You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Dwight,"Don't do it, Michael."
Michael,... It's a million-dollar sale.
Andy,"So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful."
Angela,I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
Andy,Hobos live in trains.
Angela,Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
Andy,"Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now."
Angela,"OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field"
Andy,Done and done-er.
Angela,There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
Andy,Do you have a specific place in mind?
Angela,No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
Andy,On it!
Jim,Dwight. Dwight.
Dwight,Get in!
Jim,Are you serious?
Dwight,Get in!
Jim,"OK, what are you --"
Dwight,Shh. They might be listening to us.
Jim,What's that?
Dwight,They might be listening to us
Jim,Who's they?
Dwight ,Customer service might be monitoring this conversation.
Jim,In this car?
Dwight,You never know. Better safe than sorry.
Jim,What are you thinking?
Dwight,Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
Jim,"The mob, maybe NASA."
Dwight,"Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that."
Jim,Is there some evidence?
Pam,"Ooh, cute shoes online."
Jim,How many shoes do you need?
Dwight,"I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?"
Jim,I'm not talking to you.
Dwight,Who are you talking to?
Jim,Pam.
Dwight,"She's not here, Jim."
Jim,"No, she's not."
Pam,Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
Andy,Yes!
Andy,"I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms."
Customer,"So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um --"
Dwight,"Wait, shut up."
Customer,I'm sorry?
Dwight,Shh. Do you hear that?
Customer,Hear what?
Dwight,Breathing. Is that you?
Customer,"Well, I am breathing, yes."
Dwight,"Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on."
Customer,I need paper.
Dwight,Ha!
Kelly,"Oh, my God. You scared me."
Dwight,Hear anything interesting?
Kelly,What are you talking about?
Dwight,I think you know.
Kelly,"You always say that, and I almost never know."
Dwight,"What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?"
Kelly,Are you accusing me of something?
Dwight,"Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself."
Jim,
Dwight,Ah!
Michael,Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.
Andy,Totally. What--- Who?
Jim,Why are you telling us this?
Oscar,I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
Michael,I am jetting off on an international business trip.
Andy,We called Angela?
Jim,Where are you going?
Oscar,You--- you call--- you called her.
Michael,To Can-A-da.
Andy,"That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God!"
Jim,Where is it?
Oscar,Alright.
Michael,Canada.
Andy,"Oh, God!"
Jim,Okay.
Oscar,Okay.
Michael,"My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery..."
Andy,So bad!
Michael,"Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi."
Oscar,"Good morning, Michael. Are you ready for the meeting?"
Meredith,Hello.
Michael,Slept like a baby.
Michael,I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. You are now sexy in your culture.
Kelly,Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
Kevin,T minus...
Ryan,This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Jim,Six point five days.
Kelly,Yeah.
Creed,One more week.
Ryan,"Okay. You have to break up with Darryl. I already typed out a text message for you. All you have to do is press ""send""."
Jim,Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
Kelly,"I don't know. I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---"
Phyllis,On more week.
Ryan,Has to be done. We'll press send together.
Stanley,Heh heh.
Kelly,Oh my God. He's going to kill us.
David Wallace,Do you have your passport?
Ryan,I'd like to see him try.
Michael,I have my passport.
Kelly,"Oh! He says it's cool. He said, ""It's cool""."
David Wallace,Got your per diem?
Ryan,That's all he wrote?
Michael,I have my per diem. I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.
Kelly,That's all he wrote.
David Wallace,"Michael, the... that's for your food."
Ryan,Can I see it?
Michael,Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
Kelly,Mmm hmm.
David Wallace,I was happy to send Michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire. But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
Ryan,Didn't you two date for like a long time?
Michael,"And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce."
Kelly,Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! Mmmm...
David Wallace,"Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad."
Client,I'll be honest with you--- we've been talking with Catalyst Paper. Their prices are better than yours.
Michael,Well that is all in the past.
Michael,"Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings."
David Wallace,"And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge."
Client,Everything okay?
Michael,They have one of those?
Michael,Yes.
Michael,Lets do this!
Andy,"Oh man, she is so pissed."
Dwight,"Wait, why do you need three suitcases?"
Oscar,Mmm...
Michael,Two are for souvenirs.
Andy,She's taking us back to first base.
Dwight,Do you have your money belt?
Oscar,What is first base with Angela?
Michael,I do. It's right here.
Andy,I get to kiss her forehead. I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra."
Oscar,I had a good time too.
Michael,"No, I don't want to wear a bra."
Andy,Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
Dwight,"Here, let me help you."
Oscar,Thank you.
Michael,Stop it! Stop it!
Andy,You up for a chest bump?
Dwight,Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
Oscar,No.
Michael,Okay. Where is my translator?
Andy,Bro hug? Back to basics. I like it.
Andy,Monsieur.
Andy,I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me. And he's delightful!
Michael,There he is.
David Wallace,Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Andy,I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation
Michael,"Yeah, we locked him up for two years."
Angela,Be good.
David Wallace,"Good, very good. See, told you. Sounds like somebody had a good trip."
Andy,I will try.
Michael,No. Actually the trip sucked.
Angela,Meaning what?
David Wallace,Excuse me?
Andy,Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Michael,"The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip."
Michael,Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?
David Wallace,What are you talking about?
Oscar,Here.
Michael,"I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van."
Michael,There we go. Our town car awaits.
David Wallace,Okay.
Meredith,It's just a van.
Michael,And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
Michael,Its not just a van.
David Wallace,"The hotel? What, M--- okay."
Meredith,"Look, I know my way around a van. That is just a van."
Michael,"It was not, it sucked."
Michael,"Dwight, can you get those please?"
David Wallace,I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Dwight,
Michael,Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---
Michael,Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
Dacvid Walalce,"Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey."
Andy,Ah... sweet!
Michael,That was a really good choice.
Michael,Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet.
David Wallcve,"Michael, please lets listen for a second."
Andy,Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
Michael,"No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man."
Michael,Take a sip of that.
Dacvid Wallace,"Michael, sometimes---"
Andy,Mmmhmmm...
Michael,That was a really sucky thing to do.
Michael,That good?
David Wallace,"Sometimes, we--"
Andy,Mmmm...
Michael,"Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect."
Michael,Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar.
Kevin,"You did it, man. Day one. Congrats."
Andy,That's really good.
Jim,Thanks man.
Oscar,I'm good.
Pam,"I'm coming back the wrong way. It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?"
Michael,You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
Jim,I missed you.
Stewardess,I'm sorry. You'll need to keep moving.
Pam,I missed you too.
Michael,"Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning."
Dwight,You're back.
Beth,We need to keep the isle clear.
Pam,"Uh, yeah."
Michael,Yes...
Dwight,Good. I need you to make five copies of these.
Andy,Oh...
Pam,I'm not going inside.
Michael,"Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums."
Dwight,Alright. First thing in the morning then.
Andy,Oh boy.
Jim,Welcome back.
Michael,"Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies."
Kelly,We're back together again baby.
Oscar,Andy brought one too.
Ryan,We're back.
Andy,Harry and the Henderson's
Kelly,"They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny."
Michael,Shhhh! Keep it down.
Ryan,I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
Oscar,I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one?
Kelly,Oh!
Michael,"Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much."
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,Hi.
Beth,Hi.
Michael,Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Beth,"Oh, I'm sorry. There are no meals on flights less than two hours."
Michael,"Oh... okay. Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a-- GAH!"
Beth,What would you like to drink?
Ryan,Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.
Kelly,For you. I'm with Darryl.
Ryan,This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day.
Kelly,Is that supposed to impress me?
Kelly,"No. Not going to happen. He has hurt me too much and too often. And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed."
Kelly,What are we doing? This is so wrong.
Ryan,Yeah... Mmmmm...
Michael,This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah.
Oscar,I'll check us in.
Michael,Alright.
Andy,Very cool.
Michael,Very cool.
Andy,"We are going to find out where the action is, my friend."
Michael,Okay.
Andy,Where's the concierge?
Michael,Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
Andy,"Mmm... bingo! Follow moi, bro-sieur."
Michael,Wow!
Andy,What about a nice sushi place? Maybe a place with a view?
Concierge,"Tsk... Oh. Matsuki. That's a good one. Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9"
Michael,"Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!"
Andy,One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
Concierge,"Oh, the Huntsman is good."
Andy,The Huntsman.
Concierge,Down here... the financial district.
Michael,"A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered."
Pam,Can't believe this.
Jim,Are you sure?
Pam,I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
Jim,Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Pam,"I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers."
Jim,"Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek."
Pam,I have to stay and retake it.
Jim,W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
Pam,That means another twelve weeks. Can you do this for another three months?
Jim,"It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream."
Pam,I know.
Jim,And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
Pam,Right.
Jim,You okay?
Pam,"Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go."
Jim,Okay.
Pam,Alright.
Jim,Alright.
Pam,Love you. Bye.
Jim,Love you too.
Michael,"Guys, she's in there."
Andy,Engaging wings
Oscar,I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
Michael,Let's do this.
Andy,Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
Michael,"Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again."
Marie,Good to see you.
Michael,"Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez."
Oscar,Nice to meet you.
Marie,Oscar.
Michael,"Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie..."
Oscar,Yes.
Michael,"...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight."
Marie,Thank you.
Michael,"And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---"
Oscar,"Michael, why?"
Michael,She's foreign. I am--
Andy,For Madame et monsieur.
Michael,"Oh, thank you."
Andy,You're welcome.
Michael,"Thank you, Andy."
Marie,Thank you?
Andy,Let me get a picture of you guys.
Michael,"Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with."
Andy,"Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked."
Oscar,How do you even know they're gay?
Andy,Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. Bad decision in a glass.
Andy,"I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse."
Andy,You'll thank me when they spank thee.
Oscar,Don't do this.
Andy,Do you guys like apples?
Guy at table,What?
Andy,Do you like apples?
Guy at table,"Uh, sorry... what?"
Andy,"Well, how do you like these apples? Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude?"
Guy at table,Is he your boyfriend or something?
Andy,"No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right."
Guy,"Dude, leave us alone alright?"
Andy,Gentleman.
Oscar,What are you doing?
Andy,"Dude, you struck out. They're totally stuck up. Here... drink up."
Michael,How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
Concierge Marie,Mmm-hmmm...
Michael,---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12
Marie,Uh...A stro cleaners on St. Johns place is the only place open on that day.
Michael,Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
Oscar,If you don't mind me asking---
Andy,Anything. You can ask me anything.
Oscar,Okay.
Andy,I'm your wingman.
Oscar,"Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time."
Andy,Right-o.
Oscar,How could anyone stand that woman?
Andy,What?
Oscar,What do you see in her? Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
Andy,What do I see in Angela?
Oscar,I want to know.
Andy,I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have s*x with her.
Oscar,You haven't had s*x?
Andy,No.
Oscar,"Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?"
Andy,"Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for."
Oscar,"Andy, something is wrong with that woman."
Andy,What is wrong with her?
Oscar,I'd like to know. You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Andy,I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
Oscar,"Do it! It's a--- Call her! Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. Andy, don't call her!"
Andy,"Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. Shh..."
Angela,Hello? Hello?
Andy,What is wrong with you?
Oscar,Why won't you do Andy?
Angela,What?
Andy,That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
Angela,Are you drunk?
Andy,This is Andy Bernard!
Angela,I know who this is!
Andy,I wanna take you to s*x school.
Angela,What?
Dwight,Who is that monkey?
Andy,Is somebody there?
Angela,Are you drunk?
Andy,I have needs.
Angela,We will discuss this later.
Andy,Naked.
Angela,What?
Andy,We'll discuss it later naked. I want to see you naked.
Michael,Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
Concierge Marie,I am so tired.
Michael,Okay.
Jim,How does everyone know already?
Dwight,Know what?
Meredith,Pam failed art school.
Dwight,"Oh, well, doesn't surprise me."
Jim,Excuse me?
Dwight,"Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions."
Phyllis,"Dwight, stop it."
Stanley,Dwight.
Dwight,What? Are there two suns?
Meredith,Come on.
Stanley,Oh my God.
Dwight,"Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy."
Jim,I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
Dwight,It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.
Andy,Oscar
Oscar,Hey.
Andy,That was fun last night.
Oscar,"Yeah, it was."
Andy,"You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada."
Oscar,"Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up."
Andy,You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards.
Oscar,I can't believe we called her up.
Angela,"Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?"
Police Officer 2,"Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad. There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there."
Kevin,Yes.
Michael,Are you kidding me? That's my salad.
Dwight,"Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie."
Dwight,"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?"
Jim,So why did you come in here?
Police Officer 2,No.
Dwight,To socialize. And inform.
Dwight,"Gahh, dammit! Come on!"
Michael,"Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier."
Police Officer 1,We got a fake tip.
Ryan,You're taking two?
Dwight,"Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?"
Kelly,"Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby."
Police Officer 1,No.
Michael,Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
Dwight,You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?
Kelly,"Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now."
Michael,You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
Michael,"Heh, okay, weirdo."
Toby,"I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael."
Jim,"Why is that, why is that weird?"
Michael,Hmm.
Michael,She said she was going to give it to him right now.
Toby,Did you?
Jim,"She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other."
Michael,Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
Michael,"Yeah, they used to."
Toby,"You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff."
Jim,Toby works here again.
Michael,"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face."
Michael,"Oh, can you imagine?"
Michael,You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...
Jim,Oh no.
Toby,I did leave.
Michael,Uhhgh.
Michael,"Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history."
Jim,You don't know.
Toby,"Well, I don't see it that way."
Michael,I don't know. What?
Michael,Do you want to hear a lie?
Jim,You should probably just meander back there
Toby,What?
Michael,"Hmmm, dare I? You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex."
Michael,I think you're great. You're my best friend.
Toby,"Hi, Micha-"
Ryan,I can't do this.
Michael,"NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!"
Kelly,Can't do what?
Michael,Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No.
Ryan,It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.
Dwight,He looks great.
Kelly,"Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you."
Michael,No.
Ryan,That was your choice
Dwight,Well rested.
Kelly,"Oh, can I come?"
Michael,He looks worse.
Ryan,"It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?"
David,"Michael, is everyone okay?"
Kelly,So you're dumping me?
Michael,"Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance."
Ryan,"Let's be adults about this. Let's have s*x one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing."
David,"I don't understand, is anyone hurt?"
Kelly,Okay?
Michael,"Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David."
Jim,"Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?"
David,"Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME."
Pam,Sure.
Michael,Yes.
Jim,Cool.
David,All in caps. Do you know what 911 means?
Pam,What are we doing at your parent's house?
Michael,"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened."
Jim,"I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now open your eyes. Tadah!"
David,Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Pam,I don't get it.
Michael,I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Jim,"I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so..."
Dwight,"Also, it's icky back there."
Jim,"So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect for an art studio. Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---"
Michael,That's true. People say it's icky.
Pam,I love it.
David,"Okay, I have to go."
Jim,You do?
Michael,"David, wait."
Pam,"Yeah, I love it!"
David,No.
Jim,Really?
Michael,Is there no way we can get rid of him?
Pam,"I mean, you bought me a house!"
David,"Not without cause, Michael."
Jim,Oh my God...
Michael,I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.
Pam,You bought me a house!
David,You have to get along with Toby.
Jim,"Yeah, I did."
Michael,No.
Pam,"Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?"
David,Yep.
Jim,"No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about."
Michael,I don't.
Pam,And the clown?
David,"Goodbye, Michael."
Jim,"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him."
Michael,Don't do that.
Dwight,"What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting"
Pam,"Oh, come on! Do you see this? Disgusting."
Andy,"So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?"
Jim,"Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that."
Andy,"Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle."
Jim,That's really not cool.
Andy,Kaaw!
Kevin,"So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?"
Jim,"Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right."
Jim,"Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. She's gonna love it. Right?"
Jim,Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
Andy,"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle? You're in for a spanking my friend. Myself and my lady? - no secrets."
Phyllis,"Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic."
Jim,"Oh thanks, Phyllis."
Phyllis,Where's your place?
Jim,"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry?"
Phyllis,Ohhh...
Creed,"Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there."
Jim,Definitely we should.
Oscar,"""To whoever made the microwave mess"
Andy,That is just obnoxious.
Oscar,No kidding.
Pam,"Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?"
Oscar,"The note. So ""holier than thou""."
Angela,"Hmm, I liked it."
Pam,Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Andy,"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess."
Meredith,"Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie."
Pam,"Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich."
Meredith,"Yeh, they're rich."
Michael,"You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again."
Toby,Well thanks Michael.
Michael,You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.
Toby,"Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too."
Michael,So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.
Toby,"Well, um, it was amazing. It really was, thanks for asking. Um the beaches were pristine..."
Michael,"Nice beaches, pristine beaches?"
Toby,"...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic."
Michael,Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?
Toby,It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
Michael,"I bet, for you."
Toby,"And uh, yeah, plus it was hot."
Michael,"Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself."
Toby,"Are you all right, Michael?"
Michael,"Yeah, I am. I am."
Michael,"I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them."
Michael,"Okay, just summarize."
Dwight,"Okay, fireable offenses include"
Michael,"That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act."
Dwight,I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.
Michael,"Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started."
Dwight,Okay
Michael,What are you doing?
Dwight,I am the bait.
Michael,For what?
Dwight,Men find me desirable.
Michael,"No, no, no."
Dwight,"Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt."
Michael,You're the bait for Toby?
Dwight,Mmhmm.
Michael,"No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me."
Dwight,Men find me desirable.
Michael,"Yes, sure they do, Dwight."
Pam,"When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that."
Jim,"Mmhmm, yeah."
Pam,Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
Jim,"Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?"
Pam,Are you inching away from me?
Jim,No.
Pam,Reach your arms out.
Jim,I'm always this close.
Michael,"Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please."
Jim,"Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so..."
Michael,"Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you"
Pam,"What do you need, Michael?"
Michael,"Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?"
Michael,"Good. N-no no no, don't."
Pam,"""Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you."""
Michael,"Pam. Pam, you gave me your word."
Ryan,You did that for me?
Kelly,Mmhmm.
Ryan,Are you happy you did?
Toby,Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
Ryan,What's up?
Michael,"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?"
Ryan,"Yeah, yeah I'll see them."
Michael,Toby can I see those? Ooh. What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
Dwight,Those are fighting words.
Michael,You mad? You mad at me?
Dwight,I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
Michael,"Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?"
Dwight,Hmmm?
Michael,Huh? He might do it...
Kelly,"Punch him, Toby!"
Michael,I dare you to. Come on.
Dwight,Come on. Baaah!
Michael,What's the matter... haaaww!
Dwight,"Hit him! Hit him, Chicken."
Ryan,"Yeah, punch him."
Michael,"Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?"
Dwight,"Ryan. Come on, man?"
Michael,"No do it, do it. I dare you."
Dwight,Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Michael,"Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon..."
Toby,"I'm not going to punch you, Michael."
Dwight,Are you really not going to punch him?
Toby,"No, why would I punch you?"
Michael,Son of a bitch.
Ryan,"You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man."
Dwight,I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Michael,Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
Dwight,There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Michael,What's that?
Dwight,"Frame him, for using drugs."
Michael,Frame him?
Dwight,"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal."
Michael,"I've never framed a man before, have you?"
Dwight,Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Michael,Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
Michael,"Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing? Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something."
Vance Refrigeration guy,A fridge?
Michael,"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some..."
Vance Refrigeration guy,What?
Michael,"Grass, weed?"
Leo,What makes you think we'd have weed?
Michael,I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.
Vance Refrigeration Guy,"Hey, just hold on one second."
Michael,"I'm not wearing a wire, so..."
Leo,Why would you even say that?
Vance Refrigeration Guy,"Hey, that's gonna be 500 dollars."
Michael,How much? How many pounds is it?
Vance Refrigeration Guy,"It's- it's two pounds. I'm losing money on this man just, give me the money. Alright, walk away."
Leo,Walk away.
Vance Refrigeration Guy,Walk away.
Ryan,"Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know"
Pam,Thank you.
Ryan,"I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup"
Pam,"I know, can you believe it?"
Ryan,"Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up."
Pam,"I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?"
Ryan,"Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse."
Pam,How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
Ryan,I--- I would find a way.
Pam,"You've seen things cleaned before though, right?"
Ryan,"I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh..."
Kelly,"Hi, Michael."
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot..."
Dwight,"Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon."
Police Officer 1,"Hi, we received a call?"
Pam,I don't know anything about that.
Police Officer 1,We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation.
Pam,Here?
Dwight,"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office."
Creed,Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
Michael,"Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on."
Dwight,"Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator."
Toby,"Hey, what is this?"
Dwight,Search his things.
Police Officer 2,"Sir, can you step away from your desk please?"
Toby,Why?
Police Officer 2,"Sir, please step away from your desk."
Toby,"Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this."
Dwight,"They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission."
Toby,"Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?"
Michael,"Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding."
Toby,Don't search my stuff.
Police Officer 1,Sir?
Toby,I have a reasonable right to privacy.
Dwight,"Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson."
Toby,Michael!
Michael,"Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?"
Police Officer 1,"Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?"
Toby,Oh my God!
Michael,"No, no no no... No, no."
Toby,That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months. What is going on?
Michael,"No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate."
Police Officer 1,Really?
Police Officer 2,Check this out.
Michael,Oh God!
Toby,That is not mine. I have never seen that before.
Michael,"No, no no no no."
Police Officer 1,Turn around.
Toby,What is going on here?
Michael,"God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!"
Police Officer 1,Do you have any weapons?
Toby,Of course not!
Michael,"Ahh, that's mine."
Dwight,"No! Michael, no!"
Michael,"Yes, it's mine."
Police Officer 2,"Some basil. Salad dressing, I think."
Police Officer 1,Salad dressing?
Oscar,Here are our final actual costs for this year.
Angela,What do you mean?
Michael,Mmm... okay.
Dwight,"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, ""I do."" And I said, ""I do."" And Andy wasn't signing a receipt"
Oscar,"As you can see, we did pretty well, so..."
Angela,Dwight! That doesn't count!
Michael,"Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old."
Dwight,"Yes, of course it does."
Oscar,"Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis..."
Angela,"No, it doesn't!"
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
Oscar,Right there.
Angela,I didn't-
Michael,There's the x-ax...icks.
Dwight,"Haha, Mrs. Schrute."
Oscar,You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
Angela,We are not married.
Michael,"Mmhmm, okay."
Dwight,Wha...
Oscar,But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Angela,Take this thing.
Michael,Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
Dwight,My... It's not my fault you don't understand German
Oscar,Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Andy,"Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? Ow!"
Michael,Ho-oh!
David,Michael.
Oscar,So you have an extra dollar.
Michael,Hey David- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
Michael,Yeah.
David,Is this why you're calling me?
Oscar,"So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer..."
Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- I'm sorry."
Michael,I'll be six.
David,Okay.
Oscar,"And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand."
Michael,"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different."
Michael,So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
David,You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Oscar,We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
Michael,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy."
Michael,Whoo.
David,"Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus."
Oscar,"We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need."
Michael,The what now?
Michael,"Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you..."
David,Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
Michael,"Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... Can anybody guess?"
Michael,...Like a tip? $645?!
Pam,New chairs?
Michael,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king."
Michael,"No, a new copier! Unless everybody can agree on something better?"
Jim,"We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you."
Oscar,"No, no, please. Please do not do this."
Michael,"All right, attention everyone."
Pam,"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year."
Jim,Let me call you right back. Okay.
Michael,So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
Michael,I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... working perfectly.
Pam,"Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good..."
Oscar,That's the original.
Oscar,"Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?"
Michael,"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? They don't have copiers. They don't even- Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this"
Pam,"Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands."
Oscar,Do you know?
Oscar,"Pam, you make more copies than anyone."
Michael,Do I know what?
Pam,Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Oscar,I think you know.
Michael,"Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one."
Michael,"Mm, no..."
Stanley,I'm with Pam. Chairs.
Phyllis,Know what?
Michael,"Alright, so, teams forming."
Pam,"Yeah, know what?"
Toby,"We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers."
Oscar,Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Michael,You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Michael,$645.00 
Toby,You'll see.
Kevin,Michael's a genius.
Pam,Michael?
Michael,Right.
Michael,Yes.
Oscar,Why'd you say dollars?
Pam,"I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this."
Michael,Because that is how my mind works.
Jim,"Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier."
Oscar,"What's 15% of 200? Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus."
Pam,What? Jim.
Jim,"Wait, what?"
Jim,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything."
Pam,You can do that?
Meredith,"Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that."
Kevin,"Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?"
Creed,"The balls on you, man."
Michael,Let's see...
Oscar,"So Michael, what do you think?"
Pam,You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
Michael,Why me?
Michael,I don't need $645
Jim,You have to make the decision.
Oscar,You're gonna get us a copier then?
Michael,"Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end."
Michael,This is so stupid.
Andy,"Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms..."
Pam,Or chairs?
Dwight,"Yeah, do tell."
Michael,"This is so, so stupid. And, God... that's my phone."
Andy,"I mean, like, ""156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left."""
Stanley,I didn't hear a phone.
Dwight,Mmhmm.
Michael,To be continued!
Andy,"""Walk until you hear the beehive."""
Michael,"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me."
Dwight,How could it be more clear?
Andy,"Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. What-"
Angela,I think Andy makes an excellent point.
Angela,"Now, I have to take care of a legal issue."
Dwight,Okay.
Andy,Was that hot or what?
Angela,But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
Pam,So what's it gonna be?
Dwight,"We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine."
Oscar,"Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done."
Angela,Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
Pam,"Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me."
Dwight,"Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on."
Oscar,You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
Andy,"Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?"
Michael,You think it's easy?
Andy,"We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit."
Stanley,It's your job.
Pam,Hey.
Michael,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide"
Jim,Hey.
Michael,"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- Hey."
Pam,"So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing..."
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Mmhmm.
Oscar,"Hey, we're going with the chairs."
Pam,I really think you should reconsider.
Michael,What?
Jim,"Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier."
Oscar,I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
Pam,"Yeah, I know."
Pam,Thanks Michael.
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,Good work. I'm proud of you. Mother-
Pam,But I really think you should reconsider.
Michael,"What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory."
Jim,"Beesly, are you threatening me?"
Jim,Truce?
Pam,"Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground. All right."
Pam,"Yeah, I guess, since I won."
Jim,Okay.
Jim,"Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. Totally kidding. I'm gonna need four."
Jim,Whew.
Dwight,This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Andy,"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?"
Dwight,You're gonna need to be more specific.
Angela,Manure. Get rid of it.
Dwight,Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Angela,Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
Dwight,"You wanna eat, don't you?"
Angela,"Honey, say something!"
Andy,"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?"
Dwight,...I'll consider it.
Andy,See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. ...Darn! Heh.
Dwight,There's a hose out back.
Andy,Okay.
Pam,"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?"
Michael,Yes.
Pam,Well that never happened.
Oscar,Michael?
Michael,I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oscar,I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Michael,"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing."
Jim,"Woah, you guys going to lunch?"
Michael,Yes.
Jim,Mind if I join?
Michael,"Ohh, God!"
Jim,All right.
Michael,Yeah!
Jim,Let's go.
Michael,Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jim,Let's do it.
Michael,All right! Cool!
Jim,Where we going?
Michael,I have no idea.
Pam,"So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. It is so on."
Pam,"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?"
Oscar,Stop it! Michael.
Jim,"Michael, that is hilarious."
Michael,"Oh, is somebody making fun of me?"
Oscar,"The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael."
Jim,Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Pam,Aww.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,"That's cool. Mm, good stuff."
Jim,You look really pretty.
Pam,Thank you.
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,Michael?
Michael,Yeah?
Pam,Hey!
Michael,"Oh, hey."
Pam,You got a second?
Michael,I do.
Pam,"Oh, good."
Pam,"Oh, that must've been so fun."
Michael,it was fun. We had a good time.
Pam,"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?"
Michael,"Oh, thank you."
Pam,"Yeah, is that a new tie?"
Michael,"Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars."
Pam,That is amazing!
Michael,You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Pam,What?
Michael,Nine dollars. The boys' department.
Pam,No.
Michael,Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
Pam,No way!
Michael,Look at that. Unh. Unh-unh.
Pam,"Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier."
Michael,Yes they were.
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,They were.
Pam,Here's what I was thinking
Michael,Mmhmm.
Pam,But not everyone...
Michael,Sits on a copier.
Pam,Or even uses the copier every day.
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,"Yeah, right?"
Michael,Very valid.
Pam,...That's it.
Michael,All right.
Pam,"All right, see you later..."
Michael,See ya.
Pam,Hot tie guy.
Michael,Hahaha!... well...
Dwight,Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Angela,No. I haven't thought of it.
Dwight,"Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard."
Angela,I would like cat.
Dwight,Cats don't make butter.
Angela,I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
Dwight,It doesn't make any sense.
Angela,Yes it does!
Andy,"Okay, guys!"
Angela,I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
Dwight,"Cow, goat or sheep."
Andy,"What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!"
Jim,"You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you."
Pam,"No, copier's great."
Jim,Yeah?
Pam,Yeah. I have my copies.
Jim,There they are.
Pam,And I have my original.
Jim,You got it.
Pam,So suck it.
Jim,Okay.
Michael,Okay.
Kevin,"Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay."
Michael,"Oh, thank you my dear."
Kelly,"Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you."
Michael,"Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay..."
Stanley,There he is!
Michael,"There he is! Hello, hello!"
Phyllis,Hello.
Michael,Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Jim,Oh!
Michael,Mm! Yeah!
Pam,There's that ass!
Michael,Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
Pam,"Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!"
Michael,"Oh... ah, I almost choked."
Dwight,Here's another place.
Angela,It's beautiful.
Andy,Hey-o!
Dwight,"So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here."
Andy,"[whistling Pachelbel's ""Canon in D"
Angela,"Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-"
Andy,I'm Andy.
Angela,I work with Dwight.
Dwight,He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
Andy,What?
Dwight,"Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister"
Angela,I do.
Dwight,"And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife."
Hank,Got a call about a problem up here.
Pam,Did somebody call Hank?
Michael,"Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads."
Hank,"So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs."
Michael,"Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. Yeah, take as many as you want."
Hank,"Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here."
Michael,Yes.
Hank,So what are we talking about?
Michael,"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-"
Hank,I know what a surplus is.
Michael,"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs."
Hank,Is that the copier?
Michael,"It is, yes."
Hank,Hmm.
Michael,What?
Hank,I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
Michael,Okay.
Pam,You can try mine.
Michael,"Oh, there we go."
Hank,"Hmm, not much lumbar support."
Michael,"Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party."
Hank,"On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do."
Michael,"So, the copier."
Hank,"Well, let me finish."
Michael,"All right, yes."
Hank,Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
Michael,"Well, what should I do?"
Hank,...Let me see the copier again.
Michael,"All right, get out. Get out."
Angela,"Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy."
Dwight,I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
Dwight,What is this?
Jim,"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas."
Dwight,You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?
Jim,Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Dwight,"Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes."
Jim,I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Dwight,"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --"
Stanley,Eh...
Phyllis,I'm sorry. It's the largest one I have.
Stanley,I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat.
Phyllis,"This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is ""Nights in Morocco"". This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate."
Michael,"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?"
Phyllis,Yes.
Michael,Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
Phyllis,Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
Angela,It's the nativity scene.
Phyllis,"Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer."
Angela,I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Phyllis,I need you to get rid of the tree.
Angela,But--
Phyllis,Thank you.
Phyllis,"Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter."
Jim,Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
Dwight,"These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil."
Dwight,"Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catchphrase"
Jim,That's the Christmas spirit.
Dwight,I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has s*x with a unicorn? Man with a horn has s*x with a royal horse?
Jim,Yes.
Michael,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out."
Dwight,They are now.
Michael,Cool. My horn can pierce the sky.
Michael,"This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything."
Meredith,Oh... my... GOD!!! Hit me again.
Michael,Alright... One more time around the block.
Jim,I will grant you one wish.
Pam,I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
Jim,Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. Dumb.
Andy,"Hey, hey... Ange... check it out. There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance."
Angela,Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
Andy,There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
Michael,"Jim, Jim...."
Jim,What is it?
Michael,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
Jim,"Wow, that is delicious."
Michael,Yeah.
Jim,Can't believe no ones thought of that.
Michael,I know.
Meredith,Ahh yeah!!
Meredith,Belly dancing!
Guy buying doll,"120, 180... 200."
Dwight,All right.
Guy,Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.
Dwight,"Oh, so glad I could help."
Guy,Thanks.
Dwight,Merry Christmas.
Guy,You too.
Dwight,Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
Michael,"Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India."
Jim,"Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Dwight,We got a live one! On fire!!
Meredith,I'm all right. I'm all right.
Andy,Sorry.
Oscar,"We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?"
Michael,"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth"
Oscar,What about February 2nd?
Jim,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Michael,"No, no. I celebrate privately."
Jim,That's cool.
Michael,Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
Oscar,Now? It's our Christmas party.
Michael,We'll do it quickly.
Jim,Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Michael,What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
Oscar,Do you know how to do an intervention?
Michael,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up."
Michael,"An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop."
Phyllis,"It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them."
Angela,I don't--
Phyllis,And napkins... fanned.
Michael,"Okay, how do you feel?"
Meredith,A little better. I threw up.
Michael,Uck... T.M.I.
Kevin,Fire girl. Too soon?
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party."
Toby,"Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking."
Michael,I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
Meredith,I'm not an alcoholic.
Michael,"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand."
Dwight,Aye.
Michael,The aye's have it.
Meredith,I don't care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic.
Michael,"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we?"
Andy,"When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B's. They called me Buzz."
Michael,"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?"
Meredith,Sure.
Michael,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
Meredith,Obviously.
Michael,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
Oscar,Where did you get this?
Michael,"I got it on a website, that's not important."
Toby,"Michael, We should contact some experts. You don't know what your doing."
Michael,"Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?"
Kelly,"Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag."
Michael,"Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better. Yes, Kevin."
Kevin,"Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool."
Michael,That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
Kevin,"Yeah, you said affected by it. Thanks again, Meredith."
Meredith,You're welcome.
Michael,"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?"
Dwight,"No, I like Meredith."
Dwight,"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching."
Michael,Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
Meredith,I am fine.
Michael,"Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do."
Meredith,I know I drink. I like to party
Michael,I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
Meredith,I am not an alcoholic!
Michael,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you."
Phyllis,I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
Angela,Please stop making me do these things.
Phyllis,"Oh, sorry, it's your job."
Angela,But it's the season of mercy.
Phyllis,You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
Angela,I lost it.
Phyllis,Ok... nice.
Meredith,I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do. To p0rn.
Michael,"Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?"
Dwight,I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Dwight,"There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick."
Michael,"Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out."
Dwight,"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to."
Michael,Dwight--
Dwight,She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Michael,...okay.
Dwight,I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Jim,"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that."
Dwight,"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks."
Creed,I can get you one in an hour.
Dwight,Really?
Toby,"Okay you know, this-- this is over."
Stanley,I agree.
Jim,"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us."
Michael,"Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help."
Michael,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice."
Jim,They've been in there for 45 minutes.
Pam,"I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now."
Phyllis,That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan.
Stanley,Mmmm... chewy.
Jim,Hey.
Andy,What's up?
Jim,Do you take requests?
Andy,Sure.
Jim,Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Michael,I'll be down in a minute. Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
Toby,Sure. Wow. Ow...
Meredith,We just missed Poor Richards.
Michael,We did?
Meredith,"Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?"
Michael,"Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess."
Meredith,"The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's..."
Michael,"We could go there, sure."
Meredith,"...Brixx's, Carmen's..."
Michael,"Yes, yes."
Meredith,"...The Fort, Andy Gavin's."
Michael,I have a new place.
Meredith,"Well, it must have just opened up."
Michael,"It-- yep, recently."
Meredith,Yeah... all right.
Michael,All right.
Meredith,Enough of this Christmas crap. Let's get some party music. Yeah!
Michael,"Yeah, oh there you go."
Meredith,Yeah!
Michael,That's good.
Meredith,Yeah that's better.
Michael,We're party girls.
Toby,"Hey Sasha, it's daddy. Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?"
Sasha,"Daddy, daddy, daddy!!"
Toby,"No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it."
Toby,This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
Dwight,$200.00 
Darryl,Yo.
Toby,"Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls."
Dwight,"Oh, that's my last one."
Toby,"Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll."
Darryl,Thanks man.
Toby,I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
Dwight,Not my problem.
Toby,"But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll. I-- I'm-- I'm begging you. I just-- I need it more than anything in this world. I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll."
Darryl,"All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400."
Toby,I only have $200.
Darryl,You can owe me.
Toby,"Oh man, thanks, thank you, thank you, thank you."
Darryl,"I know, right. Merry Christmas."
Toby,Oh thanks. She's gonna... oh...
Darryl,Something wrong with the doll?
Toby,No. It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
Meredith,Sunrise Rehab? No! No! No! I told you no! There is no way!
Michael,It's okay. It's all right.
Meredith,No way! There is no way! No way!
Michael,"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--"
Meredith,No way! No way! There is no way!
Michael,Here we go. This is gonna be good.
Meredith,No! No way! I told you. We talked about this. There is absolutely no way. No! No! There is no way! No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Michael,Yes you are.
Meredith,I am not going in there! NO!!
Meredith,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Michael,Shhh... just calm down.
Meredith,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No! No!
Michael,Come on. Shh...
Meredith,No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
Michael,Here's the door. Here's the door.
Meredith,There is no way! There is no way! No! No!
Michael,Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
Meredith,This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Rehab Nurse,Can I help you?
Michael,I have a deposit. Alcoholic.
Meredith,No! No! No! No! No!
Michael,So do I sign?
Meredith,NO!!!
Phyllis,I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
Angela,It's outside.
Phyllis,I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be.
Angela,Shut up.
Phyllis,Excuse me?
Angela,"I'm not moving the tree. Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell. And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree."
Phyllis,Okay. Angela's having s*x with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
Dwight,Well don't look so surprised.
Pam,I knew it.
Jim,You did not know it.
Pam,I knew some of it.
Jim,Everyone knew some of it.
Pam,It's Christmas.
Jim,You knew it.
Pam,Thank you. I knew it.
Jim,She knew it.
Michael,As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.
Andy,"All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo."
Angela,I think I'd like to go home now.
Andy,"Sure. Dooo. Tough room. Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night."
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?"
Dwight,Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Michael,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!"
Angela,I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
Pam,"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard."
Kelly,I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
Dwight,Aah!
Dwight,Come on!
Phyllis,"Wow, thirteen!"
Meredith,"Hey, has anything happened yet?"
Dwight,Yes!
Dwight,Where are you?
Michael,"No. No, no. There was wind."
Oscar,Mm-mm. It's 4
Dwight,I was just jogging.
Kevin,"Oh come on, man! Believe in something."
Michael,"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over."
Dwight,"Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes"
Jim,"No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead."
Kelly,"There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?"
Michael,I want another try. Here we go! Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
Phyllis,Why isn't Dwight turning around?
Stanley,There was a car.
Oscar,The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
Michael,I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Creed,Yeah.
Oscar,Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
Dwight,"Alas, after much consideration and deliberation..."
Michael,"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number."
Pam,Oh my God!
Oscar,That's impossible.
Stanley,What's happening?
Michael,Beat it!
Phyllis,Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
Michael,"Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad."
Dwight,Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
Pam,Quick announcement
Andy,Yeah.
Kevin,Whoo-hoo!
Everyone watching,Oh!
Pam,"Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy."
Dwight,Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
Kevin,Hot tamales.
Andy,You give up?
Pam,Yeah.
Dwight,Never! Get out and face me like a man!
Kevin,Uh oh.
Andy,I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
Pam,"So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more..."
Dwight,"You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! All you do is dress fancy and sing. ""La la la la la la la la la la!"" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!"
Andy,"Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday."
Andy,"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?"
Michael,"Wait, you still don't know..."
Dwight,"Last year, idiot!"
Jim,"No, no. Nope."
Jim,Dwight! Are your legs broken?
Andy,Hmm?
Dwight,No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Jim,Nothing.
Jim,"Andy, are you all right?"
Michael,You still don't know.
Andy,"Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!"
Jim,Why don't... Let's...
Dwight,"Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!"
Michael,What are you doing?
Andy,"What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
Jim,How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Dwight,I sa-
Michael,Andy.
Andy,"What? You stupid idiot! You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods..."
Jim,Ahh!
Dwight,"Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!"
Andy,"No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you."
Andy,I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
Michael,"No, what I'm saying is..."
Dwight,What?
Jim,"No, no."
Andy,What!
Michael,"No, that's not it."
Dwight,She's sleeping with you?
Jim,I know.
Andy,I'm her fiance.
Jim,"Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward."
Dwight,She said she was only sleeping with me.
Michael,How can he still not know?
Andy,"Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one."
Jim,We can't figure that out.
Dwight,
Michael,I can't take it anymore.
Andy,Thank you.
Dwight,"Wait, what? You can't take what?"
Michael,"Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. Ahh!"
Michael,I am telling Andy.
Dwight,"[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow"
Dwight,No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
Michael,"Who should it come from, then?"
Everyone,Angela.
Michael,Are you still having intercourse with her?
Oscar,What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Michael,Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
Oscar,Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar
Dwight,Seems like you already know where.
Angela,"Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top."
Kevin,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away."
Angela,That's enough.
Kevin,"Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on"
Oscar,"That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form."
Kevin,"How about, ""I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?"""
Oscar,There you go.
Andy,"That cannot be true! You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself..."
Dwight,Trade seats with me.
Jim,No.
Dwight,I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
Jim,Please stop.
Dwight,I need a soup spoon.
Dwight,Rule 17
Dwight,
Angela,What is it?
Dwight,You've got to tell Andy about us.
Angela,That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
Dwight,Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
Angela,You're expanding on your worst idea.
Dwight,Do you love me or not?
Angela,I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
Dwight,Because you're engaged to Andy.
Angela,
Michael,Well?
Dwight,Not yet.
Jim,When?
Andy,When what? When what?
Michael,You know this can't go on.
Andy,What can't go on?
Michael,We have to put an end to this.
Andy,Seems like...
Michael,Come on.
Andy,You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
Jim,This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Dwight,Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
Michael,When will she be ready?
Dwight,I don't know.
Michael,Is she crazy in bed?
Dwight,Yes.
Jim,Stop. What?
Michael,"How so, specifically?"
Jim,"Okay, listen."
Dwight,Eager.
Jim,This shouldn't happen at work.
Dwight,And flexible.
Jim,And!
Michael,Really?
Jim,This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Michael,It's too late.
Jim,"Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything."
Michael,I am already walking.
Dwight,"Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down."
Michael,"Okay, what does that mean?"
Dwight,Might get ugly.
Michael,"Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it."
Jim,But you're leaving...
Dwight,Have a good trip.
Michael,Thanks. Andy?
Andy,Yeah.
Michael,Walk with me.
Andy,"Will do, boss-man."
Michael,"Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear..."
Andy,You're not making any sense.
Michael,"Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day."
Andy,All righty.
Michael,Which will be fine. I am off!
Andy,Have a good meeting!
Michael,Thank you!
Andy,Kick Wallace's ass!
Michael,"Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so..."
Andy,I can't hear you through the glass
Michael,Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
Andy,What?
Michael,All right. See you later. Ahh.
Andy,Are you serious?
Michael,Yep.
Meredith,I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Oscar,You said that yesterday.
Meredith,"Yeah, my neighbor got murdered."
Jim,What are you standing for?
Dwight,"If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin."
Jim,You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
Dwight,"If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to."
Jim,"Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit..."
Andy,I need to talk to you.
Angela,We can talk right here.
Andy,I need to talk to you in private.
Kevin,We're not listening.
Andy,Let's go to the conference room.
Andy,Is it true?
Angela,What have you heard?
Andy,That you're sleeping with Dwight.
Angela,That doesn't sound like me.
Andy,Is it true?
Angela,"Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake..."
Andy,Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
Angela,A little bit.
Andy,How long has it been going on?
Angela,"I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again."
Andy,Who else knows about it?
Angela,Michael.
Andy,Who else?
Angela,"Let me think about it... I, um... there..."
Andy,Oh God. Come on!
David,"So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?"
Michael,Right what?
David,"Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is."
Michael,"David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever."
Michael,"Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation."
Michael,"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler."
David,"Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time."
Michael,"Hey, what say we order up some pasta?"
David,What say we do.
Angela,"Standard, you know? Nothing fancy."
Andy,"So like, missionary..."
Angela,I said nothing fancy.
Andy,Do you love him?
Angela,I love you.
Andy,Why should I believe that?
Angela,"Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together."
Andy,Who says that?
Angela,"Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong."
Andy,Where's Dwight?
Jim,"You okay, man?"
Andy,"No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time."
Creed,You are welcome.
Andy,Dwight.
Dwight,Andy.
Andy,It's over.
Dwight,Oh good. She broke up with you.
Andy,No. It's over between you two.
Dwight,"Uh, no way. I am not giving up."
Andy,You have to.
Dwight,No I don't.
Andy,She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
Dwight,"Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me."
Andy,Angela Bernard.
Dwight,Will never be her name.
Andy,It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
Dwight,I don't think so.
Jim,"Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?"
Andy,I'm telling you to back down.
Dwight,And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Andy,Then I'll make you.
Dwight,Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
Andy,Through the use of force.
Dwight,"That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest."
Andy,I will fight you.
Jim,Nope.
Dwight,"Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela."
Andy,Fine!
Dwight,Fine!
Oscar,This is nuts.
Dwight,What is your weapon?
Jim,"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because..."
Dwight,"Hey, this is none of your business."
Jim,Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Andy,Guess what? Not happening at work.
Dwight,Yes!
Andy,We're gonna do it outside.
Dwight,Outside of work.
Andy,None of your business.
Dwight,None of your business then. Good. So what weapon?
Andy,My bare hands.
Dwight,That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
Andy,Then I'll get something too.
Meredith,I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Pam,"Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now."
Angela,I will respect the results of the duel.
Pam,Of course you will.
Meredith,I call loser!
Andy,I will be taking my break at 4
Dwight,I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
Andy,What a coincidence.
Dwight,Mm.
Jim,"So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God."
Jim,[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office
Dwight,How'd that get there?
Meredith,There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
Jim,Thanks Meredith.
Michael,"So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, ""Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?"" And he looks at me and he says, ""Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket."" And I look back at him and I say, ""I feel the need!... The need for tweed."""
David,"It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. And thanks for coming in."
Michael,"Oh, thank you."
David,Yes.
Michael,"I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me."
David,Yeah.
Michael,Okay.
David,"Yeah, finish up."
Dwight,What's this?
Dwight,"Its business, not personal."
Jim,Looks like a red wire.
Michael,"Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people."
Dwight,Hmm. It wasn't here before.
Dwight,"Its over, Michael, its over."
Jim,"Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires."
Michael,Im not a shark.
Dwight,Yours doesn't.
Andy,"Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? Okay. And all those opposed?"
Jim,Doesn't it?
Kevin,This is ridiculous.
Dwight,"No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires."
Oscar,"That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place."
Jim,"Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore."
David,This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Phyllis,"Dwight, get out of here!"
Michael,Mpfh.
Stanley,What are you doing?
David,Good work.
Jim,"I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there."
Michael,Thank you.
Michael,"What you talking bout, Wallace?"
David,"Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy."
David,Hi Michael how are you?
Michael,"Okay, bye bye."
Michael,"Hi, I am well, how are you?"
Dwight,"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?"
David,"So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job."
Michael,I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
Michael,"Oh, have you not?"
Michael,"Oh, hey what is this?"
David,"Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business."
Pam,Hillary swank.
Michael,Yeah.
Michael,"Oh, she is hot."
David,"There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me."
Michael,Okay.
David,I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Michael,"Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?"
David,"Look, this is important, Michael."
Michael,"Oh, well, then, email it to me."
Phyllis,You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
Stanley,"Oh, I do."
Andy,What are you guys talking about?
Stanley,"Some actress, whether shes hot."
Andy,Who is the gal in question?
Phyllis,Hillary Swank.
Creed,"Ah, Hillary Swank."
Kevin,Not at all.
Meredith,She's got mean eyes.
Pam,Have you seen her with her bangs?
Kevin,She looks like a monster.
Jim,"Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work."
Meredith,She is an amazing actress.
Kevin,That is not the question.
Phyllis,She's not hot.
Kevin,"Yeah, thank you Phyllis."
Jim,"Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it."
Angela,I'm not voting.
Jim,"No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand."
Kevin,Five. Five to five.
Jim,"Thank you, accounting department."
Kevin,So what do we do now?
Dwight,What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
Michael,I will seduce her.
Dwight,"No, I wanna seduce her."
Michael,"No, I will seduce her."
Dwight,"Please Michael, please."
Michael,"No, I got it."
Dwight,You'll fall in love with her.
Michael,"Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support."
Dwight,"Okay, let's go over the plan again."
Michael,"Alright, I am a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies"
Dwight,Your fictitious name?
Michael,Michael Scarn.
Dwight,I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,Then we meet at the Denny's...
Michael,No.
Dwight,...and then we compare notes.
Michael,"No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP."
Dwight,No!
Dwight,You know how I feel about IHOP.
Michael,"Oh, don't start,"
Dwight,Are you socialist?
Michael,You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
Dwight,I'll have a cup of a coffee.
Michael,You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
Dwight,Store only has three employees.
Michael,So what?
Dwight,It means they are not expanding.
Michael,Maybe they are shrinking.
Dwight,No.
Michael,They could be shrinking.
Dwight,No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Michael,Ah ha Yup.
Dwight,"Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch."
Michael,Mm hmm .
Dwight,Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
Michael,"And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business."
Dwight,"Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus."
Michael,"Argh, why are you all..."
Dwight,Get your clouds right.
Michael,Shut up.
Dwight,"So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. No, no like this. Good."
Michael,Ready to do this?
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,Good. Here come the sharks.
Michael,"In nature, there is something called a food chain"
Michael,Hello.
Entire Prince family,"Hello, hi."
Michael,My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
Prince Grandfather,"Oh, please come in"
Michael,Thank you.
Prince Grandfather,What kind of business are you in.
Michael,We are a law firm.
Prince Grandfather,"I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office."
Michael,"You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question for you would be how many clients do you have?"
Prince Grandfather,About 80.
Michael,Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
Prince Grandfather,"It's just me, my wife and my son."
Michael,"Ah, so when did you set up shop?"
Prince Grandfather,I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.
Michael,"Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely ."
Prince Grandfather,Mmhmm.
Andy,Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic
Entire office,Hot!
Kevin,The debate is whether she is hot.
Stanley,"What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here."
Kevin,"Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting."
Andy,"Okay, TMI."
Michael,"So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?"
Prince Grandfather,You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.
Michael,Well that is... because... I am a genius.
Prince Grandfather,Oh really?
Michael,"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession."
Dwight,"Hello, I would like to apply for a job."
Prince Grandfather,"Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now."
Dwight,Why don't you just get rid of this guy?
Prince Grandfather,That's my son.
Dwight,I'm your son now
Michael,Try 80.
Dwight,"Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business."
Prince Grandfather,I sure hope not.
Dwight,Me too.
Jim,"I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people."
Kevin,"Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture."
Oscar,"Kevin, c'mon."
Kelly,"Yeah, shut up Kevin."
Kevin,"He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing."
Jim,"Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? Does that end the debate?"
Kevin,"No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game."
Angela,Oh my God.
Jim ,This close.
Prince,Grandfather
Dwight,"My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings."
Michael,"Hey, hey, how is your interview going?"
Dwight,It's going very well.
Michael,"Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?"
Linda,You want a picture of me?
Michael,"I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left"
Linda,Can I get a copy of that?
Prince Granddaughter,"Grandma, I can't do this."
Michael,"What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?"
Prince Granddaughter,Right.
Michael,"Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?"
Prince Granddaughter,8
Michael,Excellent! Way to go! Nice!
Prince Grandmother,Don't put that.
Kevin,"Ladies and gentlemen, even though the pen1s was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy."
Pam,Kevin!
Angela,"Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker."
Jim,OH!
Michael,"Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision."
Prince Grandfather,Wait
Michael,"I... Okay, okay, okay, alright, thank you."
Dwight,"Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car."
Michael,Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
Dwight,Thank you very much.
Michael,I cannot wait to contact your clients.
Dwight,Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls.
Prince Grandfather,Bye bye now. So long.
Dwight and Michael,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
Michael,"Haha, we struck the mother load!"
Dwight,Cmon.
Michael,Wallace is going to freak.
Dwight,All their top clients I can't believe it.
Michael,He's going to absolutely freak.
Dwight,"Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go."
Michael,Oh shoot.
Dwight,You drove over that. Go back
Michael,"Oh God, what was that?"
Dwight,That's not good.
Kelly,"No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!"
Dwight,Oh my God.
Michael,"Aw, it's alright."
Dwight,"Oh man,"
Michael,"Aw, my car."
Dwight,Not good.
Prince Grandfather,Is everyone okay?
Prince Grandmother,It sounded bad.
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,"No no, we are fine. You have done enough already."
Dwight,You've done more then you can possibly know.
Michael,"Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so..."
Prince Grandfather,A tow truck is going to charge you one hundred bucks to take you a mile. Let me take a look.
Michael,"No, no, really not necessary."
Dwight,He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
Prince Grandfather,I'll be right back I'm just going to grab my tool box.
Pam,"Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access."
Kevin,"Wait, what?"
Oscar,"See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot."
Dwight,How much longer is this going to take?
Michael,You know let me give you some money for this.
Prince Son,"No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands."
Michael,"Oh coffee, that's too much."
Dwight,"This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?"
Prince Grandfather,Well that outta do it.
Prince Granddaughter,Its all better.
Michael,Thank you.
Prince Grandfather,"Gosh, well so long."
Dwight,I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Michael,"Ok, goodbye Prince Family."
Dwight,"Goodbye prince family, should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. Bye bye."
Dwight,
Jim,"I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying."
Pam,"No, because..."
Michael,"Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?"
Dwight,"Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them."
Michael,"Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine."
Dwight,They could do better.
Michael,"Why don't we just, live and let live?"
Dwight,What?
Michael,Live and let live.
Dwight,"I'm not familiar with that expression,"
Michael,It's from James Bond.
Dwight,"It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive."
Michael,I'm not going to make this call.
Dwight,"Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?"
Michael,My heart says...
Dwight,"Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions."
Michael,That is true.
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,Jan... Ryan.
Dwight,"Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us."
Stanley,"I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot."
Dwight,"There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died."
Michael,You're right.
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Dwight,"Good, so, where are you going?"
Michael,Just something I have to do first.
Dwight,Where are you taking the client list?
Michael,"Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone"
Dwight,"Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No."
Michael,Oh shoot!
Dwight,"Freeze, give me the list!"
Dwight,"No no no, I can't let you do this!"
Michael,Those people will be ruined.
Dwight,"Last week I gave a fire safety talk. And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. Today, smoking is gonna save lives."
Phyllis,It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Dwight,Does anyone smell anything smoky?
Dwight,"Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!"
Angela,Did you bring your jerky in again?
Pam,"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom."
Dwight,
Lily,I'm in here.
Pam,"Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!"
Sam,"I uh, I'm sorry I didn't uh, realize you were in a bath. Do you want me to go?"
Phyllis,What--
Lily,I want you to stay.
Andy,"Whoa, fire!"
Jim,Gimme a break.
Dwight,"Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?"
Andy,"I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite."
Pam,The phones are dead.
Sam,Get that in there. Oh yeah.
Dwight,"Oh, how did that happen?"
Lily,Get that done already.
Kevin,It's out in the hall.
Sam,I know but if I get it in deeper...
Dwight,"No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct."
Jim,Can you believe this? He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
Michael,"Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm."
Andy,"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?"
Dwight,"What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?"
Pam,So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
Michael,Stay calm!
Andy,"You guys, they're making out."
Dwight,"Wait, wait, wait."
Pam,Hey.
Michael,"Everyone, now calm down!"
Jim,Hey.
Dwight,"No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway."
Pam,"Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?"
Michael,What does warm mean?
Jim,"Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal."
Everyone,Oh my God.
Pam,
Dwight,Not a viable option.
Jim,What?
Pam,Try a different door.
Pam,"I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it."
Dwight,"Okay, what's next?"
Jim,Mmm...
Michael,Don't run.
Pam,You're good to talk to.
Dwight,Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?
Jim,"I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um..."
Andy,It-- it's warm.
Michael,Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
Dwight,"Well, uh, another option."
Michael,My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...
Jim,Back door.
Michael,"It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance."
Dwight,Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!
Jim,Don't open your eyes.
Phyllis,Oh! I forgot my purse.
Pam,What? Oh...
Stanley,Leave it woman!
Michael,"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out."
Michael,"Get out of the way! Go, go, go!"
Meredith,Chunky monkey.
Dwight,"Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can..."
Michael,Too expensive.
Oscar,Ah! My hand! That's hot!
Stanley,Chocolate.
Andy,Aah! This ones hot too!
Michael,"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones."
Michael,"Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself."
Stanley,It's my bio-feedback machine..
Dwight,"Okay, let's go."
Michael,"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?"
Everyone,Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!
Stanley,It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
Dwight,"Calm, please"
Michael,You have stress?
Andy,Get out of the way!
Stanley,Yes...
Dwight,Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Michael,During our relaxation exercise?
Andy,Move it!
Phyllis,Let me get you some water.
Dwight,"Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?"
Michael,"No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go."
Angela,It's okay. Shh shhh.
Stanley,"No, Michael, No."
Dwight,"A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people."
Michael,Let me getcha.
Angela,Oscar.
Stanley,"Would ya, would ya step back please"
Dwight,What's next?
Michael,"Ok, alright."
Angela,Oscar!
Stanley,Please. A little further.
Oscar,Stay alive! I'm getting help!
Michael,Ok.
Angela,Pull me up!
Stanley,That's better.
Oscar,You're too heavy!
Michael,"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? Let's give this a shot."
Angela,I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit! Oh!
Michael,Hellloo...
Dwight,How about 911? Anyone? 911.
Kevin,"Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out."
Pam,What do we do?
Michael,So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
Dwight,Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?"
Jim,"Okay, I am not dying here. Come on."
Pam,What did you say to my dad?
Angela,What is that? What is that?
Jim,What?
Andy,The fire's shooting at us!
Pam,"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment."
Phyllis,What in the name of God is going on?!
Jim,"Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again."
Andy,"Yes! Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!"
Jim,"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents..."
Phyllis and Creed,Ahhhh!!!
Pam,What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
Andy,"Go, go, go, go, go!!"
Michael,I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
Michael,Help!! Help!!
Dwight,Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Stanley,I'm about to die!
Michael,Oh...
Dwight,Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.
Dwight,Speaking of which...
Jim,What?!
Michael,"Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge."
Dwight,"Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. So, what have we learned? Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack."
Michael,"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short..."
Michael,"No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth."
Kelly,A vacation.
Jim,"No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!"
Michael,"What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other..."
Michael,He's going to swallow is tongue.
Oscar,Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Jim,No. Michael. Michael.
Michael,Si senor.
Michael,Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.
Oscar,That's offensive.
Jim,Michael! Michael!
Michael,"It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good."
Michael,Leave me al--
Kevin,Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Andy,You're choking him!
Oscar,I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Michael,Saving him!
Michael,I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
David Wallace,How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
Dwight,"May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you."
Dwight,A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Phyllis,"Hey, this is your apology letter."
Michael,Electricity.
Dwight,That was the last signature I needed.
Dwight,Shampoo.
Michael,"Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. Ok... lower the mic for the midget."
David Wallace,You could have burned down the whole building.
Angela,"If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott."
Dwight,"I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days."
Angela,I normally don't enjoy making people laugh.
Lawyer,"Did you shout, ""Fire!"", causing a panic?"
Angela,If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
Dwight,"Yes I shouted ""fire!"". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--"
Group,Michael Scott!
Michael,Hed. Hedded
Michael,"Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!"
Dwight,When no one hedded--
Kelly,"I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael."
Michael,Take hedded of.
Michael,You're so lucky! Good one...
Dwight,N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Meredith,"Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said ""Gross""..."
Michael,Heed. Heed.
Michael,Well...
Dwight,"So, you--"
Meredith,"Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget."
Michael,Take heed of.
Michael,Pow pow pow...
Dwight,"And, well, I don't see my co-workers--"
Oscar,
Michael,Take heed of.
Michael,"NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY."
Dwight,Hee-heeding this right now.
Jim,"Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary."
Lawyer,Wh--what?
Michael,I know where this is goin'.
Michael,"Okay. This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed."
Jim,Do ya?
David Wallace,"No, we are mad."
Michael,No...
Michael,Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.
Jim,Ok. Remember Spider face?
David Wallace,"No, we're not."
Michael,No.
Michael,"I am not a mind reader, David."
Jim,"OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface."
David,"Look, this is very serious offense. We have cause to fire you."
Michael,Spite her - ok
Michel,"Can you shove down? Instead... shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer."
Jim,Yeah... yep.
Dwight,No.
Dwight,How dare you all attack him like this.
Michael,And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.
Michael,"Oh, stop it Dwight."
Dwight,PETA.
Dwight,Michael is your superior.
David Wallace,"Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscious?"
Michael,No no no no no no!
Michael,Do you?
Dwight,"Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him."
David Wallace,Michael?
Michael,Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
Michael,You talking to me?
Dwight,"Ok, no, they don't understand who they have..."
David Wallace,Yeah.
Michael,"That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot."
Michael,What?
Dwight,You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
Dwight,Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
Michael,Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
Michael,"No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands."
Dwight,Are you calling me an idiot?
Dwight,Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?
Michael,Idiot.
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,"Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land."
Dwight,I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
Pam,"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses."
Michael,That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
Michael,"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?"
Dwight,What? You?
Pam,"Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!"
Michael,Yes.
Michael,"Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind."
Dwight,Come on.
Darryl,"Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?"
Michael,I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.
Michael,"We are, we are a family."
Dwight,That's preposterous.
Darryl,"Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there."
Michael,"No, I will."
Michael,Oh very funny.
Michael,"Nobody should have to go to work thinking, ""Oh, this is the place that I might die today."" That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true."
Darryl,What's his name?
Michael,"Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. Welcome back, Stanley."
Michael,Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
Stanley,"Thank you, Michael."
Darryl,Roy left years ago. What's his name?
Stanley,"It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people..."
Michael,I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Stanley,Not maybe. Yes or no.
Warehouse Michael,"Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic..."
Stanley,No way. Uh-uh.
Darryl,What's his name?
Stanley,Are you from another planet?
Michael,Jefferson.
Stanley,"Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it."
Darryl,Nope. His name is Michael.
Stanley,Did I stutter?
Andy,"What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott."
Stanley,I'm done. Goodbye.
Michael,"Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought sorry. I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um..."
Stanley,But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks."
Michael,Andy.
Dwight,"It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them."
Andy,A throne for your highness.
Kevin,He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order.
Stanley,I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
Oscar,Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Michael,"No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet."
Kevin,I'm almost done.
Stanley,I'm going to die.
Oscar,"That reeks, and I'm trying to eat."
CPR trainer,"A-B-C. Okay? And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation."
Dwight,Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Michael,"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means ""always be closing."""
Jim,Yep. You're being replaced.
Dwight,This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
Pam,I think he meant personal day.
Michael,Shut it. Shut it.
Dwight,"Oh, that's quite a leap Pam."
Michael,"We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket."
Phyllis,"I hope he's ok, I feel bad."
Kevin,I can't keep doing this forever.
Creed,"Give it up, he's dead."
CPR Trainer,It's been 20 seconds.
Jim,He just sent a text...
Kevin,Call it.
Creed,What's a text?
CPR Trainer,Would you like to try next?
Michael,Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
Dwight,Absolutely I would not.
Michael,"You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. I'm okay. No, I'm not."
Michael,You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Pam,Phyllis there's a package for you.
Stanley,"Oh, I don't know."
Phyllis,"Oh, ok."
Phyllis,"That's not a good idea, Michael."
Dwight,Got it.
Michael,Come on.
Lily,"Sam, Sam Sam. It's not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh, I can never trust you."
Phyllis,He needs to rest.
Sam,Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I don't care how much time we have left. I don't care what my friends say! And I don't care what your mom thinks! Frankly I'm pretty sure she's not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. Lilly. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lilly... Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button!
Michael,No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
Andy,Sam! Sam!
Stanley,I would die.
Pam,"Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then."
Michael,And you're okay with that?
Jim,So what did he say? Was it my fault?
Stanley,I'm okay with the logic of it.
Pam,"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best."
Michael,"Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this."
Jim,You ok?
Stanley,"Yes. I had a heart attack. I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire. I feel like I'm working in my own casket."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!
Pam,When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.
Angela,Michael!
Andy,"I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad."
Michael,This is you we're talking about.
Pam,Michael! It's really good to see you.
Angela,Michael.
Dwight,Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Michael,"Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go. Stanley. All right."
Jim,Are you alright?
CPR Trainer,"So, assessing the situation. Are they breathing?"
Oscar,"Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday."
Michael,"No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs."
Michael,"I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people."
Rose,"No, that's not part of it."
Pam,What?
Michael,"Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?"
Michael,"Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during s*x and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... Oscar, you're gay."
Kevin,I would want to live with no legs.
Oscar,Wow.
Michael,"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything."
Michael,"Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe."
Rose,"All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute ."
Michael,"They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case."
Michael,"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?"
Jim,How's that gonna help you?
Michael,I will divide and then count to it.
Jim,Right.
Rose,"Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees. Do you know that song?"
Michael,"Yes, yes I do. I love that song. First I was afraid, I was petrified."
Rose,"No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive."
Michael,"Okay, I got it."
Creed,You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
Michael,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive."
Michael,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah..."
Andy,"Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, you can look the other way. Loo do do!"
Rose,Okay!
Andy,"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da"
Rose,Okay!
Everyone,"Stayin' alive, stayin' alive."
Rose,"Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him."
Dwight,"Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?"
Rose,I have no idea.
Dwight,Anyone else?
Phyllis,We bury him?
Dwight,"Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest."
Creed,"He has no wallet, I checked."
Michael,He is an organ donor.
Dwight,He is.
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. Here we go.
Angela,Oh my God! Dwight!
Kelly,Dwight!
Angela,What are you-- What are you doing?
Dwight,We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
Stanley,I'm not feeling well. I need to sit down.
Michael,"Hey, Stanley."
Andy,Stanley.
Michael,Are you okay?
Angela,Oh my God!
Stanley,Oh my God!
Angela,Dwight!
Dwight,Clarice?
Stanley,Oh my God!
David Wallace,Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
Dwight,"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic."
David Wallace,We had to pay for it. Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
Michael,Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
Dwight,Wow.
Michael,"Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person."
Andy,"Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges."
Pam,"We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people."
Jim,And we don't know how.
Pam,"But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him."
Jim,Punishment fits the crime.
Jessica Alba,I want you to meet my nana. Nana...
Lily,Mmmhmm...
Jessica Alba,This is Sam.
Sam,Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
Lily,Please-- Call me Lily. Let's play Bridge. You can be my partner.
Sam,Alright... Lily.
Jim,What's going on?
Jim,"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage."
Pam,My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
Pam,He's not saying what he needs to say.
Andy,Hmm? Who? Sam?
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,"I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--"
Andy,Hmm.
Andy,"Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head."
Michael,"Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?"
Dwight,I have.
Michael,Let's hear it.
Dwight,"""I state my regret."""
Jim,You couldn't of memorized that?
Dwight,"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal."
Michael,
Jim,"This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left."
Michael,"This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it."
Jim,
Michael,Could I stick it with a pin?
Pam,Ugh.
Michael,"Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine."
Jim,
Michael,"You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert."
Jim,"That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh..."
Michael,What?
Jim,"What the heck? Is that, uh..."
Michael,You find it?
Jim,"I didn't, I'll look somewhere else."
Michael,All right.
Jim,All right.
Michael,Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
Michael,"Hello, good morning."
Pam,Good morning.
Michael,"You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles."
Michael,"Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy."
Pam,He brought a sled.
Michael,"No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie."
Pam,"Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks."
Michael,"Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night."
Pam,Separate rooms.
Michael,Well that goes without saying.
Pam,I'm going to say it anyway.
Michael,"Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's..."
Pam,This is a new cardigan.
Michael,...kind of Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
Pam,No.
Michael,"No. Oh, all right."
Jim,"Hey, Kelly."
Kelly,Screw you.
Dwight,"Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior."
Kelly,Oh yeah? Screw you too.
Jim,Whoa! What was that all about.
Phyllis,"You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday."
Jim,Go ahead.
Dwight,"Go ahead, you do it."
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,I insist.
Jim,"Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama."
Dwight,What he said was...
Jim,"Just, easy."
Dwight,"...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads."
Jim,Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Dwight,"I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. That's on my side."
Jim,So this is fun.
Kelly,"My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl."
Pam,Can I turn on the radio?
Michael,No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
Pam,But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
Michael,"Then listen to your iPod, Pam."
Pam,That's dangerous.
Michael,Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
Pam,That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Michael,"You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so..."
Pam,"No, that was a long time ago."
Michael,Is that why your wearing makeup today?
Pam,"No, I'm not even wearing that much."
Pam,"I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so..."
Julia,"Oh, this is a nice office."
Stanley,You don't have to lie. Through here.
Andy,"Um Phyllis, who's that?"
Phyllis,She's out of your league Andy.
Andy,"For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women."
Phyllis,Sexually?
Andy,This conversation is over.
Andy,"I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win."
Jim,We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
Kelly,Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
Dwight,If you say screw you one more time...
Kelly,"Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that."
Dwight,"Hey, HEY."
Jim,Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
Kelly,"I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again."
Dwight,Oh God.
Jim,Okay.
Kelly,"In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it."
Dwight,What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Kelly,Ice Cream.
Pam,"Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin."
Michael,"Hello, Rolando, how are you?"
Rolando,Hi.
Michael,"Rolando, I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime."
Rolando,"Uh, your late, everyone's already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over."
Michael,"Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked."
Pam,"Stop it, please."
Michael,"That's what I do, steal my trick."
Pam,Please cut it out.
Karen,"Hey. Hi, guys."
Michael,Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
Karen,What!
Pam,Michael!
Karen,Of course not!
Michael,"Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had s*x, and..."
Karen,"Let's just get this over with, shall we?"
Michael,"Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?"
Jim,Are you kidding?
Dwight,"Well, I'm not done yet."
Jim,"Dwight. This, fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?"
Dwight,They match the carpet
Jim,What is that? It is your birthday period.
Dwight,It's a statement of fact.
Jim,Not even an exclamation point?
Dwight,This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
Jim,I can't believe how bad this looks.
Dwight,"Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's."
Jim,"Okay, good then."
Dwight,Have you collected the money from everyone?
Jim,I am working on it.
Dwight,How much do you have?
Jim,Six dollars.
Dwight,That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
Jim,I said I was working on it.
Dwight,
Andy,"Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! Whoa! Aah, Aah!"
Michael,"NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?"
Karen,"Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?"
Michael,"I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died."
Karen,But now we think you're a liar.
Michael,Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
Michael,"I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it."
Michael,"I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. ""M"" your name is Mark."
Mark,Yes.
Michael,Got it. It works.
Karen,"Uh, it's very insulting."
Michael,But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
Mark,But we already know each other's names.
Michael,"Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try."
Karen,"Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over."
Michael,"Oh, I still have more."
Karen,"Can I please see you in my office, please?"
Michael,"She is pregnant. She is knocked up. ""K"" Karen. Pam, let's go."
Julia,"I can't accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget."
Andy,"Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather..."
Stanley,Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
Andy,"Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes."
Stanley,Are you out of your damn mind?
Andy,"Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her."
Stanley,We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
Andy,"We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down."
Stanley,"You really like her, huh?"
Andy,Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
Stanley,Give me two clients for her.
Michael,"I grab this, and I turn it on and I say, ""Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."""
Karen,"No that's, that is incredibly dangerous."
Michael,"No, don't worry, the chain is off."
Pam,No it's not.
Karen,"You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team."
Michael,"Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it."
Pam,So when are you due?
Karen,"Uh, in about a month."
Pam,"Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations."
Karen,Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
Michael,"It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?"
Karen,"Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me."
Michael,"Oh, great."
Karen,"His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky."
Pam,"Oh, he's cute."
Karen,"Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?"
Pam,What is happening there?
Karen,"Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky."
Pam,It's really sweet.
Michael,"No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time."
Karen,"So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?"
Pam,"Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged."
Karen,That's so great. That's great.
Pam,Thank you.
Karen,"Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you."
Michael,Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
Stanley,"I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother."
Andy,"So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?"
Julia,"No, it could go straight to our business address."
Andy,"Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?"
Julia,"Actually, I, I don't have a boyfriend."
Andy,"Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird."
Andy,"Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking."
Oscar,"Oh, my desk is over..."
Creed,"This gal, she's really into you?"
Andy,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up."
Creed,"All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her."
Andy,"Okay, it sounds risky."
Creed,"Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?"
Andy,"Wait, what?"
Michael,"I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean."
Pam,I like her.
Michael,"Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think."
Pam,"I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came."
Michael,Why?
Pam,"Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good."
Julia,Thanks for walking me out.
Andy,"Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so..."
Julia,You must be freezing.
Andy,I am about to die. Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
Julia,"Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car."
Andy,"Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee."
Julia,"What's a ""Nard-Dog""?"
Andy,This is the Nard-Dog.
Julia,Whoa. What the hell?
Andy,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty."
Julia,I just got out of a relationship too. It's really hard.
Andy,"Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?"
Julia,"No, I, I don't think so."
Andy,"Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk."
Julia,Okay.
Andy,Take care Julia.
Julia,Thank you.
Andy,Sorry I tried to kiss y...
Andy,We lost the account.
Dwight,Damn it! Dwight Schrute.
Jim,How old's Kelly?
Dwight,Who is this?
Jim,It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
Dwight,Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
Jim,"Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?"
Dwight,"Uh, 24. 37."
Jim,Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
Dwight,I'll call you back.
Dwight,"I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. ""Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center."" Juvie. ""According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..."" Blah, Blah, Blah."
Pam,Are you asleep?
Michael,"No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?"
Pam,"No, remind me."
Michael,"Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small."
Pam,"Perfect boobs, of course I remember Holly."
Michael,"She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that."
Pam,"Okay, lets go."
Michael,I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
Pam,"Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this."
Michael,Okay.
Jim,So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
Creed,I'd like to contribute.
Jim,"Oh, great."
Creed,There you go.
Jim,
Jim,Thanks.
Michael,"I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success."
Dwight,Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. Many happy returns.
Michael,"I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy."
Michael,I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
Michael,And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
Pam,"No, we don't need to do that."
Karen,How's Jim?
Michael,"Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!"
Pam,We're engaged.
Pam,You mean Tony?
Karen,"Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!"
Michael,"Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!"
Pam,"Oh, wow, thank you!"
Pam,"Oh, Michael."
Michael,You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
Michael,"Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty."
Pam,"... Okay, let's go."
Oscar,Two?
Kevin,I didn't eat lunch. I didn't eat all my lunch.
Angela,"Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good."
Kevin,It... yeah.
Oscar,"Angela, you're more chipper than usual."
Angela,"I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive."
Meredith,How much?
Angela,Seven thousand dollars.
Creed,For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
Oscar,Where'd you get that kind of money?
Angela,I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
Kevin,"Wait, you didn't give it back?"
Angela,He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
Meredith,Seven grand?
Angela,Mm-hmm.
Meredith,I gotta see that little bitch.
Angela,I have something better than a picture. Come on.
Oscar,You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
Angela,"Yeah. I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year."
Meredith,She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Angela,Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
Kevin,"Any cat, you mean."
Angela,And person.
Pam,"So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! I've been driving too long."
Dwight,What did you do?
Kelly,Stop yelling at me!
Dwight,What did you do?
Kelly,I didn't do anything!
Dwight,"What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?"
Jim,Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
Dwight,Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
Kelly,I was kickin' it.
Dwight,In juvie.
Jim,What?
Dwight,Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Jim,Yep.
Dwight,For reha-
Jim,Got it.
Dwight,What did you do? Huh?
Jim,"Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy."
Dwight,"Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. What did you do?"
Kelly,"My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!"
Dwight,I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Jim,"Hey, you know what? I got you a cake."
Kelly,You did? I wanna see the cake.
Jim,And... ta da.
Kelly,I hate it.
Jim,How do you hate it? It's a cake.
Kelly,"Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!"
Jim,Right.
Jim,"I forgot if there was an ""e"" between the ""l"" and the ""y."" I still don't know."
Kelly,"I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!"
Jim,Birthday.
Dwight,Frosting.
Kelly,Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme.
Phyllis,There's always a theme.
Dwight,"Nice job on the cake, Bozo!"
Jim,"Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl."
Pam,"Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah."
Michael,Do I look okay?
Pam,You look good.
Michael,Hi.
Receptionist,"Hi, can I help you?"
Michael,"Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch."
Receptionist,"Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat."
Michael,"Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?"
Receptionist,"Actually, she's on an HR retreat for the next three days."
Michael,Oh- She's not here?
Receptionist,"But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. He's a salesman here."
Michael,A.J.
Receptionist,"Yeah, he's her boyfriend. He's just over there."
Michael,She has a boyfriend.
Pam,"I'm so sorry, Michael."
Michael,"How could she do this to me, Pam?"
Pam,She's not doing it to hurt you.
Michael,"I can't do the presentation, I can't- ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!"
Pam,"Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-"
Michael,"I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay?"
Pam,"You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing."
Michael,And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
Pam,"Yeah, maybe."
Michael,
Pam,Maybe. One step at a time.
Michael,
Pam,You can do this.
Michael,I can do this.
Oscar,"It could be snacks, or-"
Kevin,Why would we-
Oscar,Wha-
Kevin,Is that what I think it is?
Oscar,Good God!
Kevin,
Oscar,
Angela,
Kevin,That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Angela,No!
Meredith,Awesome!
Angela,"Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed."
Meredith,"Yeah, I know fixed"
Kevin,No way.
Angela,"No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!"
Kevin,"Oh, the other one's watching."
Jim,"Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake."
Dwight,Busy!
Jim,"Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?"
Dwight,"Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face."
Jim,You know what? I could use a little help.
Dwight,You know what? I'm a little busy.
Jim,"We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?"
Dwight,It's not effeminate. It's festive.
Jim,"You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!"
Stanley,"I know, I just read it on the sign."
Michael,"Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper"" and get them to ""Show us the money!"" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?"
A.J.,A.J.
Michael,A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
A.J.,
Michael,What do you race cars?
A.J.,I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.
Michael,"Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?"
A.J.,"Yeah. Why, are you interested?"
Woman,I have a question about discounts from distributors.
Michael,"Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?"
A.J.,"It's pretty serious, yes."
Michael,Huh- Does she ever talk about me?
Pam,"Oh, God."
A.J.,Excuse me?
Man,What does this have to do with sales?
Michael,It's all connected. Shut up. Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
A.J.,"No, what are you talking about?"
Michael,Does it feel good?
A.J.,Does what feel good?
Michael,"Your life. Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. Oh, wow. Ooh, okay."
Pam,"Michael, get off the floor!"
Michael,"Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards."
Pam,"No, no, no, you have to do it-"
Michael,"No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. Okay... okay."
Pam,"That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation. Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump."
Pam,"Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! Cutting down the competition."
Angela,"Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now."
Oscar,
Kevin,
Angela,
Kevin,This is getting weird.
Oscar,Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?
Kevin,Ohhh...
Michael,
Angela,Has this been on the entire time?
Oscar,I have no idea.
Kevin,I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Angela,"Well, sorry I'm late."
Oscar,"I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball."
Pam,Don't look up. Don't look up.
Michael,Want some pie?
Pam,No.
Michael,I went through Holly's things.
Pam,What?
Michael,I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
Pam,"Oh, Michael..."
Michael,"I also stole something off of her computer. A document called ""Dear Michael."""
Pam,You did what?
Michael,I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
Pam,She never sent it to you?
Michael,"No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it."
Pam,No.
Michael,Yes.
Pam,"No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust."
Michael,How?
Pam,"Because, she didn't send it to you!"
Michael,"I know, I know. You're right, you're right."
Pam,I could read it.
Michael,"No, that wouldn't-"
Pam,"Yeah, I could read it."
Michael,"No, you don't have to do that."
Pam,Go get your laptop.
Michael,Okay.
Pam,What? I'm not in love with her.
Dwight,"You have to write my suggestions down, too."
Jim,"I'm not writing, ""Horse Hunt."" I don't even know what that means."
Dwight,It's in the name.
Jim,"Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting."
Dwight,"You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid."
Jim,"Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?"
Dwight,"Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord."
Jim,"Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one."
Dwight,"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. What about you?"
Jim,"Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome."
Dwight,"That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed."
Jim,Didn't see that one coming.
Pam,It's deleted.
Michael,Well?
Pam,She still has feelings for you.
Michael,She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
Pam,"I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over."
Michael,You're sure?
Pam,
Michael,Okay.
Kelly,
All,Happy Birthday!
Meredith,Surprise!
Dwight,"Hey, it's not a surprise."
Jim,Not a surprise.
Kelly,This doesn't look good.
Jim,"What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?"
Kelly,
Dwight,Told you.
Jim,"You haven't heard our theme, though."
Kelly,"You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?"
Jim,"That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television."
Dwight,"Our theme, if you will."
Jim,"Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping."
Dwight,That's our theme.
Kelly,Cool.
Jim,Yeah?
Kelly,I love it.
Dwight,"Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?"
Kevin,Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Dwight,No.
Jim,No.
Kevin,"Oh, then pick TV."
Meredith,Take a nap!
Oscar,TV.
Kevin,"No, watching TV at work is really cool."
Stanley,"Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now."
Creed,Bonnie Hunt is on.
Kelly,"You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap."
Jim,All right.
Dwight,"Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go."
Meredith,Surprise.
Dwight,"Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this."
Jim,"Ahem. This is for you... and ...Happy Birthday, Kel."
Kelly,Thank you.
Dwight,"Okay, you've got one hour."
Kelly,I'm too excited to sleep.
Dwight,"Mm, great cake."
Phone Salesman,Hi.
Jim,Here they come.
Pam,"Good morning, can I help you?"
Pam,What?
Phone Salesman,"Yes, I'm from Techstar about a new phone system for you. I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott."
Jim,"No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough."
Pam,"I'm sorry, he's not in right now."
Pam,"Well, you should cover it with the broccoli."
Phone Salesman,Really? He's never around when I come by.
Jim,"Oh great, I have to cover?"
Pam,Shoot.
Pam,Do you think they dined and dashed?
Pam,"They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job. But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. Vending machine."
Jim,"Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed."
Phone Salesman,"How about I make an appointment to come back? That way, I know he'll be here."
Pam,I thought we were having a nice time.
Pam,That is a great idea.
Jim,We were.
Phone Salesman,Great.
Pam,Yeah.
Pam,"Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really..."
Jim,Empty.
Jim,"Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya?"
Pam,Mine too.
Pam,There he is!
Jim,Oh boy.
Phone Salesman,"Oh, hi! Great."
Pam,My God.
Jim,"Nice to meet you, yeah. Whew! I can assure you we don't need a new system though. Happy with ours."
Jim,OK.
Michael,"Hello, may I help you?"
Girl,Is this the party?
Jim,Jimbo!
Michael,Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Michael,...Jim.
Bob,OK then.
Jim,Ayyyy!
Jim,So...
Michael,Ayyyy!
Bob,Where were we?
Pam,Ayyyy!
Phyllis,Bowling.
Michael,Ayyyy!
Pam,"Yep, that, yeah."
Jim,Ayyyy!
Bob,You didn't eat much there Jimbo.
Dwight,Ayyyy!
Jim,Oh initially I did.
"Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight",Ayyyy!
Bob,Want some meat?
Phone Salesman,"Ok. I'm, uh, I'll be going."
Phyllis,"Oh sure, a little piece. Ooh, no mushroom though."
"Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight",Ayyyy!
Bob,Forgot.
Michael,What was that?
Phyllis,"Yeah, thank you."
Pam,That was funny.
Kevin,"Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is."
Michael,That was funny. Let's go do it to somebody else. Ayyyy!
Lynn,That's really sweaty.
Michael,"Oh, look at that. Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year. You doin OK, bud?"
Kevin,Are you on email?
Kevin,I miss Stacy.
Lynn,"Oh, yeah."
Michael,"Yeah, I hear ya. It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting..."
Kevin,Cool. Bye.
Kevin,I can't even imagine.
Lynn,"Bye, Kevin."
Pam,This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
Kevin,Good Valentine's.
Jim,"You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but."
Dwight,"So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you."
Pam,"Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday?"
Blonde,OK.
Jim,Yeah. She's fine.
Dwight,"OK, what's up?"
Kelly,"So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer. Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too."
Blonde,"Look, I'm gonna go..."
Michael,"Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here. They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall."
Dwight,"Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign--"
Michael,"Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces."
Blonde,"Look, we already have a paper supplier."
Michael,"Pam, really, they're back?"
Dwight,"OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God!"
Pam,I can't see them when they're on the floor
Michael,"Hey, you don't deserve her."
Jim,"They're for her to look at, Michael."
Dwight,"Thanks, Michael."
Michael,"Can I have a word with you, Jim?"
Michael,"Hey, if anybody wants to go..."
Jim,"Yes, let's have a word."
Oscar,We can stay a little longer.
Michael,"Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office."
Michael,"Really? Oh, thanks."
Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Kelly,"Michael, it's time."
Michael,"Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment."
Michael,"You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit."
Jim,I understand that.
Oscar,"Come on, we'll all go."
Dwight,So sexy it becomes hostile.
Michael,OK.
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Michael,"Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good."
Jim,"Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key."
Stanley,"Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy."
Michael,"Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--"
Blood Drive Worker,Of course. That's weird. You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using Band-Aids.
Jim,We do.
Stanley,"I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just Band-Aids."
Michael,--that none of us can be a part of--
Phyllis,Damn.
Pam,"You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael."
Michael,"--then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party."
Jim,That sounds fun.
Michael,"So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only."
Dwight,"Yeah, deal with it Pam!"
Michael,"So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other."
Dwight,Having trouble finding a vein?
Blood Drive Worker,"Yup, a little."
Dwight,How about now?
Dwight,"I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my pen1s up into itself."
Michael,"I am about to give blood. The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --"
Blood Drive Worker,You're gonna need to lie down right over here.
Michael,Okay. Hello.
Blood Girl,"Hi, I cant talk right now. I'm sorry."
Michael,"Oh, OK."
Blood Girl,"Whew, I'm really nervous."
Michael,"Yeah, me too."
Blood Girl,"Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up."
Michael,"Oh, well, that's fine."
Blood Girl,"Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah."
Michael,"Yeah, can I point something out to you?"
Blood Girl,Sure.
Michael,You're actually talking a lot.
Blood Girl,"Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous."
Michael,"Okay, here we go."
Blood Drive Worker,"Alright, here we go."
Michael,"Oh, God."
Blood Drive Worker,Just relax.
Michael,"Yup, I'm good, whew. Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. Hawaiian blood punch."
Blood Girl,"Oh, that's gross."
Michael,Type O-Ocean Spray.
Blood Girl,"God, stop. Stop it."
Phyllis,"Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon. Michael is terrified of bob."
Pam,What do you think?
Jim,I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Pam,We're in.
Michael,Yick.
Blood Girl,What?
Michael,I looked at the bag.
Blood Girl,Ew.
Michael,I looked straight at the bag.
Blood Girl,That's not good.
Michael,"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?"
Blood Girl,"Well, ok... bags! Alright, that was bad."
Michael,That was mean.
Blood Girl,"Um, a hat."
Michael,A hat.
Blood Girl,A hat with no blood in it?
Michael,That is full of soup.
Blood Girl,You're cute.
Michael,What?
Blood Drive Worker,You're done.
Michael,"Oh, already."
Blood Girl,"Ah, we did it!"
Michael,"Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days."
Blood Girl,Is he OK?
Michael,"Oh my God, how long was I out?"
Hank,What?
Michael,"Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?"
Blood Drive Worker,Oh. She left.
Michael,"OK. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers. This is hers, she left her glove. I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove."
Blood Drive Worker,I'm sorry sir we can't give out that information.
Meredith,What are you doing?
Kelly,Decorating.
Meredith,I'll help. Now it's just a stupid baby.
Kelly,"Yeah, thanks."
Phyllis,It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Pam,Anything to get out of that office.
Phyllis,I know
Bob,"I honestly don't know how you can work with that jackass, that other jackass, and that new jackass."
Phyllis,"He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy."
Jim,"Oh yeah, I understood."
Michael,"Well here we all are. Alone but together. No flowers for us. Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships. I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan? He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?"
Kelly,"Well, his heart was in the right place."
Michael,"Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random s*x. Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar."
Oscar,I don't think so.
Michael,"Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest."
Oscar,I can't.
Michael,"If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else?"
Bob,Everyone here who's bowled a 280 please raise your hand.
Jim,"No way, a 280?"
Pam,"Wow, that's impressive."
Phyllis,Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Jim,Yikes.
Phyllis,"Come on, Bob. Raise your hand."
Jim,"No. Bob, no. No!"
Pam,What?
Bob,"One time. You love bringing up that one time, don't you?"
Phyllis,Yes I do.
Pam,Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
Jim,"That is a lie, that is a lie."
Pam,"Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back."
Jim,But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Pam,"No, you just have little dainty fingers."
Bob,Oh yeah. You can always model ladies' jewelry.
Jim,"Nobody asked, Bob!"
Oscar,Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Angela,"Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but..."
Oscar,"I was stupid, I told him."
Kevin,Was he in to you in like a gay way?
Michael,"Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story."
Oscar,He told me he wasn't gay.
Michael,Really sad.
Oscar,I'm not done yet.
Michael,Oh my God.
Kevin,"A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says ""I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City."""
Michael,"Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!"
Angela,My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Oscar,"Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here."
Angela,"No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David."
Oscar,"Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?"
Angela,I guess I have. Huh.
Michael,Alright who's next? Where's Andy?
Oscar,He's on one of his honeymoons.
Michael,What?
Oscar,"He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage."
Kevin,"My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said ""Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!"" and she said that we're done."
Michael,You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
Dwight,"You're right. OK everyone, back to work."
Michael,"No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together."
Dwight,A net? a giant net?
Michael,No. Not a giant net.
Dwight,What do you have in mind?
Michael,I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
Dwight,"Oh God, that's a terrible idea."
Michael,Old fashioned meet market --
Dwight,No.
Michael,-- I don't think it is.
Dwight,"Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt."
Michael,"These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say ""I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow."" Funny little bird, but he gets the job done."
Michael,Hey.
Dwight,Hey. No movement.
Michael,"Ah, still early."
Dwight,"Eh, its not that early."
Michael,So how you holding up?
Dwight,I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Michael,"No. No, I meant about being single today."
Dwight,Oh. Meh.
Michael,"Meh, exactly. Eh."
Dwight,Eh.
Michael,"Oh, here we go."
Dwight,Hello.
Michael,Hello.
Dwight,"Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? Hi, Dwight."
Michael,"Babe alert! Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig."
Lynn,"Oh, hi! I'm Lynn."
Michael,"Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self."
Kevin,Hello.
Lynn,Hi.
Michael,"So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev. Where you from?"
Kevin,I'm from here!
Michael,"Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better."
Kevin,"Thank you, Michael."
Dwight,"I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead."
Blonde,I- I- believe you.
Dwight,"You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today."
Blonde,"Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses."
Dwight,You must use a lot of paper.
Blonde,Oh God tons of it .
Pam,What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
Jim,I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Pam,"Oh, damn. They've been in there for like ten minutes."
Jim,Look at that. Bob ordered hot food.
Pam,Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries.
Jim,We should help him out.
Kevin,At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool.
Lynn,That does sound cool.
Kevin,"I used to go there with my fiance. Before she left me. No, I mean, before I left her. She left me."
Kevin,I think I blew it. It all happened so fast. So... fast.
Michael,"So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair."
Eric,I am.
Michael,"Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair. Alright, I'll let you guys talk."
Michael,"It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so it's not too late."
Dwight,"...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?"
Michael,No reason.
Dwight,Is somebody after you?
Oscar,Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Dwight,"Hey, it just takes one!"
Michael,"Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by."
Kelly,You met a woman when you were giving blood? That is so romantic.
Michael,"It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her."
Kelly,"Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale."
Meredith,She could be your soul mate.
Dwight,"Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up."
Oscar,It's possible.
Kelly,She could be.
Michael,"Believe me its nothing. I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched."
Kelly,Aww.
Pam,"Yeah, that's no problem."
Michael,Could I be a part of the meeting also?
Michael,Pam?
David,"You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting."
Pam,Sure. Uh huh.
Jim,"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie."
Michael,"Pam? Knock, knock."
Dwight,Alright.
Pam,I'm on the phone.
David,"Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away."
Michael,"I know you are. Knock, knock."
Dwight,"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka."
Pam,"You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--"
Man on phone,"Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? I hear panting."
Michael,4-9-1-7-4-5-1
David,No. No dogs.
Pam,"0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. It really makes us look unprofessional."
Dwight,So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea.
Michael,"They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock."
Michael,There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Pam,Who's there?
Pam,It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Michael,Buddha.
Dwight,Pam...
Pam,Buddha who?
Michael,I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Michael,"Buddha this bread for me, won't you?"
Dwight,That is my idea.
Pam,Great.
David,We are gonna call you back guys. What is going on here?
Michael,"I, I need something to wipe my hand."
Michael,"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?"
Pam,"Now there's, there's butter on my desk."
David,"No, no."
Michael,That was helping. It was classic.
Dwight,It is my idea.
Dwight,I got a knock-knock joke.
Michael,Oh how dare you.
Michael,No... God.
Dwight,It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
Dwight,"OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me."
Michael,"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?"
Michael,Alright.
Dwight,Horse Boat.
Dwight,"Knock, knock."
Michael,Oh please.
Michael,Who's there?
Dwight,A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Dwight,KGB.
Michael,Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
Michael,KGB -
Dwight,Oh give me a break.
Dwight,We will ask the questions!
Michael,"...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas."
Michael,What the hell was that?
Dwight,That's because they're easy!
Dwight,What are you doing?
Michael,They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Michael,What are you doing?
Dwight,Women's urinals... uh...
Dwight,Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
David,"Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?"
Michael,"You, you like that?"
Dwight,"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death."
Dwight,C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Michael,Thank You!
Michael,Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
David,"What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?"
Jim,Ding Dong.
Michael,"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame."
Michael,Who's there?
David,"OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes."
Jim,KGB.
Pam,OK.
Michael,"Dwight, get the door."
David,I am gone.
Dwight,I'm not answering it.
Michael,When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
Michael,Answer the door.
Dwight,Oh I am. In my own words.
Jim,Ding dong.
Michael,I want to see it.
Dwight,"No way, it's the KGB."
Dwight,No.
Jim,Ding dong.
Michael,I want to see it.
Dwight,I'm not answering that. You answer it.
Dwight,"No, Michael."
Michael,I'm not gonna answer it
Michael,Give me... Give me the diary.
Dwight,"I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB."
Dwight,No!
Jim,The KGB will wait for no one!
Lynn,Hi.
Dwight,It's true.
Kevin,"Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking."
Pam,"Good morning, Michael."
Lynn,OK.
Michael,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa."
Kevin,I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Pam,"Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages."
Lynn,OK.
Michael,"Why thank you very much. Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!"
Kevin,Nice. Boobs.
Pam,Jelly beans.
Andy,"Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!"
Michael,"No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!"
Dwight,Ding dong.
Michael,"The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy."
Jim,Who is it?
Michael,"I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. Umm hmm."
Dwight,KGB.
Jim,We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Jim,"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second."
Michael,Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
Dwight,"When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?"
Jim,'Free paper.'
Jim,"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine."
Michael,No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
Dwight,We have more houses to visit.
Andy,"Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this..."
Jim,"If you want to come back then, that'll be fine."
Michael,"No, you don't. No, it - What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?"
Dwight,We will come back at... how is 4
Kevin,I think I should call her.
Jim,I get back from work around 6.
Andy,No! No! No!
Dwight,How about 5
Kevin,Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
Jim,"You can try. That, that might work."
Andy,"You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'"
Dwight,"Very well, we will come back at 5"
Kevin,But I do like her just the way she is.
Jim,Alright.
Andy,Well that's not what we agreed on.
Jim,What are you doing?
Andy,Huh?
Jim,"Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know."
Andy,No.
Pam,"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out."
Andy,You're asking him to give up all of his power.
Jim,What power?
Kevin,"Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker."
Andy,"You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'"
Pam,That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
Jim,Well guys with girlfriends don't.
Andy,"That's low, Tuna."
Jim,"Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. One of my clients found a golden ticket. Yup. No, congratulations."
Michael,Woo hoo.
Jim,I'll take that down right now.
Michael,Tell me
Jim,I'm on the phone.
Michael,...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
Jim,Hold on one second.
Michael,Invite them on the tour.
Jim,It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Michael,"Really? That's kind of a big client. Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?"
Oscar,Ten percent?
Michael,Yeah?
Oscar,They're our largest client.
Michael,Yeah.
Oscar,It's gonna hurt.
Jim,"Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't."
Jim,How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Michael,I thought I did. So...
Jim,OK...
Michael,Well no harm no foul.
Jim,...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Michael,"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good."
Michael,Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Darryl,Start over.
Michael,Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
Darryl,Were the boxes near each other?
Michael,Irrelevant.
Darryl,I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Michael,"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?"
Michael,My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. That...
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial."
Pam,"When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one."
Michael,"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?"
Oscar,They can.
Michael,"No, they can't."
Oscar,"Yes, they can."
Michael,"Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about."
Oscar,"Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?"
Michael,"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -"
Jim,"So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too."
Michael,"Thank you, Jim is with me."
Jim,"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you."
Michael,Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
Creed,That's not why.
Michael,"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. Yes."
Pam,Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?
Jim,Good one.
Michael,"OK, don't get that. Please?"
Stanley,I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Michael,That is not constructive.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet."
Michael,"Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--"
David,"Michael, what the hell is going on here?"
Michael,How are you doing?
David,Fine. What is going on?
Michael,My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
David,"Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?"
Michael,"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know."
David,How could you not know Michael?
Michael,I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
David,"Might have hi--- OK, what firm?"
Michael,You're breaking up.
David,Michael?
Michael,"OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant."
David,Was it the sales department?
Michael,Yes.
David,Was it Jim?
Michael,No.
David,"OK, was it Dwight?"
Michael,Yes.
Michael,"Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea."
Dwight,That was your idea.
Michael,"Woah, wow, who told you that?"
Dwight,You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Michael,"No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight."
Dwight,You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Michael,I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
Dwight,Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Michael,"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary."
Dwight,You don't keep a diary.
Michael,Yes I do. You've just never seen it. March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Dwight,Hold that thought. March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Michael,Why do you have a diary?
Dwight,To keep secrets from my computer.
Michael,"OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up."
Dwight,Impossible.
Michael,"Yes, you did."
Dwight,"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math."
Michael,What are you writing?
Dwight,Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Michael,Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
Dwight,With all my heart.
Kevin,You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Jim,"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance."
Kevin,Right.
Pam,I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
Jim,"No, that is what I mean."
Pam,"Shush. Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic."
Kevin,Like that?
Jim,"No, stop it."
Andy,Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
Andy,...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
Michael,We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
Dwight,"OK, what am I thinking right now?"
Michael,"Umm, nacho chips."
Dwight,No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Michael,"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me."
Dwight,"Oh, not gonna happen."
Dwight,I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
Michael,"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly."
Dwight,What about Shoe La La?
Michael,It's not ready yet.
Michael,"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house."
Michael,"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight."
Oscar,These aren't announcements.
Michael,"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information."
Dwight,I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Michael,He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
Dwight,Well...
Michael,"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion..."
Dwight,We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Michael,Right.
Dwight,No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Michael,That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
Dwight,Try me.
Michael,That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
Dwight,I haven't made a decision yet.
Michael,You kind of have.
Dwight,No.
Michael,Yes.
Jim,You cannot take the fall for him.
Dwight,He said he would do the same for me.
Jim,He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
Dwight,I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Jim,There it is.
Michael,"Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation."
David,That's too bad.
Michael,"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?"
David,"Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight."
Dwight,David... you're welcome.
David,I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute?
David,Alright Dwight. This is huge.
Dwight,That's what she said!
Michael,"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?"
Dwight,Inspiration.
Michael,Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
Dwight,You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Michael,Give me the details of how that happened.
Jim,"You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years."
Michael,What?
Jim,And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Dwight,Apology rejected.
Pam,"Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight."
Dwight,Oh Pam.
Creed,"Good work, kid."
Dwight,Thanks old man.
David,"This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you."
Dwight,Yeah.
David,"Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?"
Pam,Sure.
Michael,David? David?
Dwight,'Cause I've got this idea...
Michael,David?
David,Yeah?
Dwight,"Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause."
Charles,Any responsibilities come with it?
Michael,I like it.
Jim,"No, not exactly."
Dwight,Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Charles,So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Jim,I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Jim,"Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that."
Dwight,"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?"
Charles,"Yeah, would you, uh?"
Jim,"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember."
Jim,Yep.
Michael,"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here."
Michael,"Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he?"
Jim,"And of course, classy."
David,Michael.
Michael,"And classy, yeah."
Michael,So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
Dwight,"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?"
David,"How did you get here, Michael?"
Jim,"Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously."
Michael,I drove.
Dwight,"Oh, here's one"
David,Ok.
Michael,"You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership."
Michael,"Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned."
Jim,That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
David,Michael. Listen-
Michael,Yes.
Michael,"Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?"
Dwight,Mr. Peanut is not classy.
David,"Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . ."
Michael,He is.
Michael,"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again."
Dwight,"He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat."
David,That's not exactly-
Michael,That's what makes him classy.
Michael,Clearly that's what you wanted.
Dwight,"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries."
David,No.
Jim,"Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind."
Michael,Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
Dwight,"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then."
David,Yes.
Jim,"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head"
Michael,I've put having a family on hold.
Michael,Strawberries?
David,We didn't ask you to do that.
Jim,That's inspired.
Michael,And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
Dwight,I said that!
Charles,Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Pam,Not classy.
Andy,Cool.
Michael,Not classy at all.
Dwight,Excellent.
Jim,De classÃ©.
Angela,"It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner."
Michael,French. Classy.
Jim,See ya. See ya. Bye!
Pam,"Hi, can I help you?"
Jim,"And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear."
Charles,"Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott."
Kelly,"I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys."
Pam,Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Phyllis,It's just me here.
Michael,Yes?
Kelly,I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
Pam,"Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you."
Phyllis,I think he left.
Michael,Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Kelly,What?! Move!
Pam,"Yeah, are you coming out now?"
Angela,"Hello, Charles? Charles!"
Michael,"Uh-huh. Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. Here he is."
Kelly,Hey! Is that his scarf?
Charles,I-I was-
Angela,No!
Michael,"Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish."
Angela,"Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?"
Jim,Hey.
Michael,"I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that."
Michael,Yes.
David,"Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-"
Jim,Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Michael,Ok.
Michael,"What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous."
David,"We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?"
Jim,"Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-"
Michael,I quit.
Michael,"You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish."
David,What?
Dwight,"Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities."
Michael,You have no idea how high I can fly.
Michael,"Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!"
Dwight,"We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is..."
Michael,"Surprise! As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles."
Charles,Thank you.
Michael,Took me all night.
Pam,This is what you did last night?
Michael,"I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental."
Kelly,"My god, he's like a black George Clooney."
Angela,"Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . ."
Jim,"Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know."
Charles,Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Jim,"I didn't think you'd notice. Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him."
Charles,Uh.
Jim,"Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh."
Charles,Your name is Jim?
Jim,"Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it..."
Pam,He just had to wear his tux today.
Jim,I thought it'd be funny.
Pam,Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
Michael,"All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department."
Charles,"Hey, I come from accounting, too."
Michael,"Oh, nerd alert!"
Kevin,Ni-
Michael,"This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that."
Charles,"Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you."
Michael,"This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange"
Andy,Hey-o!
Michael,There you go! Where's the other?
Charles,"You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history."
Michael,"Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history."
Kevin,Hey!
Charles,How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Michael,"Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner."
Charles,"Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels."
Michael,Oh! Well...
Charles,That's great.
Michael,Above and beyond.
Charles,"Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy."
Michael,That's true.
Charles,"But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this."
Stanley,Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Michael,No. Absolutely not.
Charles,"Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that."
Oscar,Do you have specifics?
Charles,"Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week."
Michael,"Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people."
Charles,You didn't tell them.
Michael,"Well, why don't-"
Charles,"Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-"
Michael,Charles is going to tell you.
Charles,"Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office."
Stanley,Fantastic.
Michael,"Well, it's not official."
Charles,"It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending."
Michael,"Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance."
Charles,"No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties."
Michael,Well-
Dwight,What about your party?
Michael,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work."
Charles,"Michael, I'm going to stay for the day."
Michael,"Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet."
Charles,"No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?"
Michael,I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
Michael,"David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed."
David,What gave you that idea?
Michael,It was my understanding.
David,I see.
Michael,"Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability."
David,"Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team."
Michael,But the branch is still mine?
David,"You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know."
Dwight,Ask him about the party.
Michael,"Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?"
David,"I'll give it my best shot, Michael."
Dwight,No the other thing.
Michael,"Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?"
Dwight,He hung up?
David,No.
Michael,"I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before."
Charles,No.
Michael,Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Charles,Saticoy Steel.
Michael,"Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names."
Charles,"No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel."
Michael,You're not from paper?
Charles,No.
Michael,Does David know this?
Charles,"Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager."
Michael,"Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-"
Charles,And what is that?
Michael,"And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?"
Charles,That's not how I plan on doing things.
Michael,"Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back."
Charles,I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Michael,Whatever David wants.
Charles,Ok.
Michael,"Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks."
Dwight,"Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em."
Stephanie,David Wallace's office.
Dwight,"Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?"
Stephanie,Good. Thank you.
Dwight,How's it hanging?
Stephanie,Alright. . .
Dwight,"Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-"
Michael,"No! You idiot! Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god."
Stephanie,David Wallace's office.
Michael,"Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine."
Stephanie,Michael...
Michael,And I really really need to talk to David.
Stephanie,Please hold.
Charles,"Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?"
Michael,I was never given a name.
Pam,"Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-"
Charles,"Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today."
Angela,That is so unnecessary!
Michael,Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
Charles,It's no big deal.
Michael,"I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad."
Charles,You still have that option.
Angela,"Thanks again, Charles."
Kelly,Thank you.
Michael,Nobody thanked me.
Jim,"Thanks, Charles."
Michael,"For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical."
Charles,"I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning."
Michael,"Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!"
Kelly,Should I seduce him?
Angela,No. No one wants to see that.
Kevin,Michael?
Michael,Yep.
Kevin,I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Michael,"Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may."
Charles,"Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours."
Kevin,Ok.
Charles,Ok.
Michael,"Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved."
Charles,That's not the way it's gonna work.
Michael,Yes it is!
Charles,"No, it is not."
Michael,"No, it is not."
Charles,"Ok, so we're on the same page, great."
Michael,"Ok, so we're on the same page, great."
Charles,"Ok, Michael, what are you doing?"
Michael,"Ok, Michael, what are you doing?"
Charles,"No, seriously."
Michael,"No, seriously."
Charles,How old are you?
Michael,How old are you?
Pam,Oh no.
Pam,"I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad."
Charles,Five years old?
Michael,Five years old?
Andy,"Duuudes, stop."
Employees,"Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. You're going to get all of us in trouble."
Charles,I will walk away.
Michael,I'm gonna walk away.
Andy,Stop doing that!
Michael,"I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room."
Pam,"And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one."
Michael,What is that smaller stripper holding?
Pam,Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Michael,Ok.
Charles,What exactly is the PPC?
Phyllis,"Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties."
Charles,"Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?"
Michael,"Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles."
Charles,This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Michael,Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
Jim,"No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please."
Charles,"Whatcha got, Jim?... What is a two-way petting zoo?"
Jim,You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Michael,It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
Pam,It's really just a regular shaped cake.
Michael,"But it's cool, and it's-"
Charles,"This isn't a good use of company time, Michael."
Michael,"Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . ."
Charles,"Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks."
Michael,"Yeah, why don't you do that?"
Charles,Thank you very much.
Michael,"Yeah, here we go. Ok."
Charles,"Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee."
Michael,What?
Charles,"Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity."
Michael,Newsflash
Charles,"I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over."
Michael,"Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it."
Charles,Come in.
Jim,Hey.
Charles,Hey.
Jim,"Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker. And a great number two for the office."
Charles,Number two?
Jim,Second-in-command to Michael.
Charles,"Oh, I didn't know that position existed."
Jim,"Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me."
Charles,So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
Jim,"Assistant regional manager, yeah."
Michael,"I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left."
Pam,"Michael, wait! I'm coming with you."
Kelly,Michael get to the good part.
Michael,You are?
Michael,"Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door."
Pam,Yeah.
Oscar,At least he is in the building.
Michael,Okay. It's going to be great.
Michael,"No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!"
Pam,"Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore."
Everyone,
Michael,Right... Executive assistant.
Pam,He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
Pam,Salesman.
Pam,"Okay focus. Focus. You're in the right building, you're with the right people"
Michael,"Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim?"
Michael,"I looked at Wallace and I said ""I quit!"" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said ""You have no idea how high I can fly."""
Jim,Still no.
Stanley,Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Michael,"Well, okay, lets go."
Michael,Why would I do that?
Pam,"Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so..."
Angela,"Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?"
Michael,Are people watching?
Kevin,That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Pam,Probably.
Meredith,Did you spit in his face?
Jim,"Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you..."
Michael,You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Michael,Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
Oscar,I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday. But I dream... so...
Jim,"I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye."
Jim,"About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying."
Pam,"Okay, see you later."
Kevin,Michael is that scotch?
Michael,Bye.
Michael,"Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on."
Charles,"So, we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't effect our day to day. But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones."
Michael,"What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories."
Kevin,Phones?
Stanley,"Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?"
Charles,"Also, there has been too much wasted time. So Stanley."
Michael,I have a job.
Stanley,Yes.
Andy,For four more days.
Charles,"Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay? I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good. Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay?"
Pam,Do you have any leads on a job?
Michael,"Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted."
Jim,You called any headhunters?
Michael,Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Dwight,"Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,"
Jim,"Right, cause that's what we are talking about."
Charles,"Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data."
Michael,You're 'I need you to' is my command.
Charles,Okay.
Andy,Hey Michael...
Michael,Hey.
Andy,Can I talk to you a minute?
Michael,You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
Andy,I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What? What's that?
Michael,Oh! Hey. What is this about?
Andy,"Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell..."
Michael,Oh.
Andy,I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Michael,"Me too, me too. Is this wine?"
Andy,Ah... busted. Yes
Michael,I already have wine.
Andy,Oh.
Isaac,Hello.
Pam,Hi.
Isaac,Isaac Silby here for the interview
Pam,"Uh, yes. Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes."
Isaac,Thank you. You interviewing too?
Michael,Hmm?
Isaac,Interviewing?
Michael,For?
Isaac,Regional manager.
Michael,Yes I am.
Charles,For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire. For obvious reasons.
Michael,Where you from?
Isaac,Philly.
Michael,That's a drive!
Isaac,"Yeah, well this is one of the few places that's hiring. It's uh, its brutal out there."
Michael,
Kevin,Pam?
Pam,Hmm?
Kevin,When will the new copier be ready?
Pam,I'm working on it Kev.
Kevin,You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.
Pam,It'll be ready soon.
Kevin,Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Pam,Is that what 'soon' means to you?
Kevin,Sometimes.
Pam,Then come back soon.
Pam,"During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'"
Creed,I think it's 75 cents.
Oscar,That's a lot.
Angela,"Bandit, No! No no no!"
Kevin,Oh!
Pam,"Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting."
Jim,Its Monster dot com. Singular.
Michael,Thank you.
Michael,"You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players."
Phone,"Hi, you've reached Prince Paper. We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business. Thank you for your support. May God bless you. Bye!"
Michael,What am I gong to do? Uh....
Michael,PSST! PSST!
Jim,Yeah... .you want me to come in your office? Oh.
Michael,"Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes."
Jim,I would prefer not to.
Michael,Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
Jim,You're starting your own paper company?
Michael,yeah!
Jim,Why?
Michael,Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper.
Jim,Do you know the industry is in decline?
Michael,Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
Jim,Right.
Michael,"Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes."
Jim,"No, I did that before, it added nothing."
Michael,Close them.
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?"
Jim,I am not gonna do this.
Michael,Obviously.
Jim,"And you are not going to, either."
Michael,"Oh, agreed, mmm, except..."
Jim,"Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary. Because they're set up to do that kind of thing."
Michael,Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
Charles,Jim.
Jim,Hey.
Charles,what are you doing?
Jim,"Nothing, just talking."
Charles,"Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?"
Jim,I didn't... no.
Charles,Okay. After you.
Michael,No I'm staying.
Charles,Okay.
Dwight,Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
Pam,"No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions."
Dwight,Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II.
Pam,"That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?"
Dwight,"Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus."
Pam,Hmm...
Dwight,My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
Michael,"Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying ""Dunder Mifflin"" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?"
Pam,Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Michael,You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.
Pam,Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Michael,"This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now."
Pam,Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Michael,"Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?"
Pam,"Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image."
Michael,Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Pam,Yeah. Good.
Michael,Thank you very much.
Pam,Mmm-hmm
Kelly,So that is why I have to leave at 5
Charles,"You know, you can run this stuff by Toby."
Kelly,Yeah I don't like talking...
Charles,Come in...
Angela,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone. I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about. Earlier."
Kelly,"Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just..."
Angela,"Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim."
Charles,Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
Angela and Kelly,"Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!"""
Charles,I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
Kelly,So you should be heading back to your desk.
Angela,Okay. Bye Charles. Well you'll let me know. Good bye.
Kelly,She's such a special person. And she's turning 50 this year.
Michael,I'm starting my own paper company.
Andy,No way!?
Michael,Yeah.
Andy,In this climate?
Michael,Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.
Andy,"Ehh... well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?"
Dwight,Your own paper company.
Michael,"Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so"
Dwight,Right...
Michael,"Potential, lots of potential. yes."
Dwight,What a courageous venture.
Michael,"It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um..."
Dwight,"Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities..."
Michael,"That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing."
Dwight,Okay. So yeah.
Michael,So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.
Dwight,"You know, I would love to put a pin in that."
Pam,"Everyone, can I have your attention. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right?"
Meredith,Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
Pam,Meredith... Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin!
Pam,"I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did."
Oscar,
Oscar,You put a note in my food?
Michael,I made it sterile.
Oscar,"Just to say ""sterile"" doesn't make it so."
Michael,"I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me."
Oscar,"Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?"
Michael,"No, no no."
Oscar,"You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?"
Michael,Okay.
Oscar,Five years?
Michael,"Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me."
Oscar,It's just not prudent Michael.
Michael,Stanley?
Stanley,Can't you see I'm urinating?
Michael,"Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now."
Stanley,No.
Michael,"Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company."
Stanley,No.
Michael,"Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars."
Stanley,No I didn't.
Michael,You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
Pam,How's it working?
Phyllis,"Um, let's see... it's fine."
Pam,Good.
Pam,"I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels..."
Charles,"Hey Hank, You ready?"
Hank,Yeah.
Charles,"Okay, Michael?"
Michael,Hmm?
Charles,"I can't pretend I haven't seen that. So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk out. And you can't take anything."
Michael,"Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks..."
Charles,"not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank..."
Hank,Okay Michael.
Michael,"Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building."
Hank,"Come on man, let's, let's go."
Kevin,"I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy. And he's super funny. Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there."
Michael,Well here we are... I would just like to...
Charles,"No, no no no. You're done, Michael."
Michael,"Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!"
Andy,What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Kevin,I think he's singing.
Oscar,I can't believe this is really happening.
Michael,... and I feel free!
Oscar,"And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone."
Andy,"The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day."
Phyllis,Andy He's gone.
Andy,I know.
Phyllis,You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
Toby,"Michael is like a movie on a plane. You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch. And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?"
Pam,Michael?
Michael,"Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!"
Angela,These are for employees only.
Michael,"Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone."
Kevin,"Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?"
Michael,"I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere."
Kevin,But you didn't want to start with us?
Michael,"No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?"
Jim,"I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else."
Michael,So which way are you leaning?
Jim,Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Michael,Thanks Jim.
Charles,"Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on."
Dwight,No.
Charles,"Okay, let me know if you find it."
Michael,"Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go!"
Charles,Michael get up!
Michael,"Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!"
Charles,"Michael, what are you doing?"
Michael,I think maybe Hank should be here.
Charles,"Hank? No, I don't need Hank Michael."
Michael,"You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it."
Pam,Oh no.
Jim,What?
Pam,I'm going with him.
Jim,What? Pam!
Pam,I'm going.
Jim,Pam! You can't be serious.
Jim,"You gonna answer that, Kev?"
Jim,Left.
Kevin,"Oh, right. Thanks. Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. Oscar, your mom!"
Charles,Forward or half?
Jim,Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Jim,"Forward, definitely."
Kevin,Please hold. Andy! Phone call.
Chares,"Okay, striker, huh?"
Jim,"No. Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier."
Jim,Striker!
Kevin,"Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it."
Charles,Let's see what you got in those legs!
Jim,"It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again."
Jim,Alright! Let's do it.
Kevin,"Okay. Andy, get ready. Transfer. Extension. Transfer."
Charles,"Alright. No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff."
Jim,Here we go.
Jim,Kickoff. My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. Alright!
Kevin,"Oh, man!"
Michael,"And I offer same day, free delivery."
Andy,"It is 1-3-4, Kev!"
Nana,"Michael, I don't know about this."
Jim,"Kev, c'mon."
Michael,Nana. I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Dwight,Hustle!
Nana,I'm not so sure.
Kevin,Hold it.
Michael,"Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other..."
Andy,You are murdering the Nard-dog!
Nana,"See, this is what concerns me."
Kevin,This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you.
Old Woman,We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
Angela,You're bad at this too!
Michael,"Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for."
Kevin,Just... don't answer that call!
Nana,This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
Stanley,Just transfer the damn call.
Michael,Okay.
Kevin,Your call is very important to us. Ple-
Nana,"I love you, Michael. I do."
Andy,Hey-o!
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,Way to go.
Nana,But no. I mean it. No.
Andy,My maid died.
Vikram,I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
Pam,"Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. Look, it's official!"
Pam,It means grandmother.
Michael,"Oh, good. My hooker's here. Hi."
Vikram,"Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?"
Pam,"Michael, you were expecting me, right?"
Vikram,"You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same-"
Michael,Yes I was. Yes I was.
Andy,"Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim."
Pam,Are you wearing anything under the robe?
Charles,"Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?"
Michael,"That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in."
Oscar,"Phyllis, Phyllis."
Pam,"This looks great, Michael."
Charles,"Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?"
Michael,Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Phyllis,"No, I swallowed a crown."
Pam,"Yes, please."
Charles,"Why'd you duck, Jim?"
Michael,What shape?
Jim,What?
Pam,... Square is fine.
Dwight,"Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?"
Michael,Alright.
Jim,"Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice."
Charles,"Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. Yeah."
Charles,Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Kelly,Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Jim,"I'm sorry, Phyllis."
Charles,"Eh, uh, in a hotel."
Charles,"Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry."
Angela,"Charles, where were you born?"
Ryan,Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Charles,"Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. Yeah."
Michael,"Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that."
Andy,"How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day."
Pam,I can't do this.
Charles,"Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? Thank you. So, umm..."
Michael,What's that?
Jim,Would you please stop that?
Pam,I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Dwight,What?
Michael,Blech.
Jim,You're breathing very heavily.
Pam,"I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?"
Dwight,This is how I breathe.
Michael,Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Jim,No it's not.
Pam,We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
Dwight,If you want to tell me -
Michael,"Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. Okay..."
Charles,"Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front."
Pam,"How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!"
Jim,Oh no. I was just -
Michael,"I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit."
Charles,"No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear ""yes""."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,... Yes.
Michael,"So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?"
Charles,Good. As I was saying...
Michael,"You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating."
Dwight,Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh!
Michael,"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine."
Pam,"So, what do you say we get started?"
Michael,Okay.
Michael,After breakfast.
Pam,I could work here. I could see this.
Pam,I'm full.
Michael,It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Michael,So how you feeling about the new company?
Pam,Are you good?
Pam,I feel good. Wow.
Michael,"Yeah, I'm good. You good?"
Michael,You excited? About the new company?
Pam,I'm good.
Pam,Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
Michael,"You know what they say, keep your friends close."
Michael,After breakfast.
Charles,"Michael, you're back."
Pam,"We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. Michael. Stop for a second."
Michael,"Yes, I am, Charles."
Michael,"No, I'm whipping them."
Charles,Mmmhmm.
Pam,"No, I know you are."
Michael,"Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared."
Michael,Just let go.
Pam,Just let me have... Oh.
Michael,"Let go, please. Just gimmee -"
Pam,"Fine! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Michael,"I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs."
Phyllis,I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Stanley,I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Creed,"Oh, he does. He does."
Michael,I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Pam,"You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -"
Michael,"I'm not overwhelmed, Pam."
Pam,"I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff."
Micheal,Whatever calms you down.
Pam,"Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. Eat an enormous breakfast. Check."
Michael,"Don't patronize me, Pam."
Pam,I think you should get dressed.
Michael,I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
Pam,"Michael, that seems impossible."
Michael,It's totally impossible!
Pam,We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Michael,Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Pam,Great.
Michael,"Okay, Ryan."
Pam,No. What? Why?
Michael,He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Pam,No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
Michael,Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
Pam,Okay.
Michael,He worked at that telemarketing place.
Pam,We'll find him.
Michael,"Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor."
Pam,Really?
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,We have an investor already?
Michael,Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Pam,"Michael, that's fantastic."
Michael,"Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. Umm..."
Pam,Hey! We need to get you dressed!
Pam,"I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. Hey! You look great! Let's go!"
Michael,Alright.
Andy,
Charles,You a soccer fan?
Andy,Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
Charles,"Well, that makes two of us."
Andy,No way!
Charles,Yeah.
Andy,I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
Charles,I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Andy,Ahhh. You b*st*rd! That shoulda been me!
Charles,"Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man."
Andy,Cool!
Jim,"I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly."
Pam,Next on the list - open the mail.
Michael,"Oh. Wow. ""Michael Scott Paper Company."" Okay. Very official. ""Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."""
Pam,"No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add ""find office""..."
Michael,How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Pam,Next on the list -- song parodies.
Michael,"Okay. Okay. ""Achey Breaky Fart."""
Pam,Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Michael,"No! No No. No. ""My Stumps."" Like ""My Humps"" but a guy with no legs."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,We can do this.
Pam,We can do this.
Andy,"Whoa! And he just goes, ""Boom"". Goal!"
Charles,Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
Andy,"You know your soccer, man."
Charles,I know. Yes I do.
Stanley,I prefer Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Charles,Oh yeah?
Stanley,From Argentina.
Charles,"I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office."
Andy,"I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but..."
Charles,"What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?"
Jim,"Uh, no. Nope. Not really."
Charles,"Well, it's not for everybody I suppose."
Jim,It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Charles,Yeah?
Jim,You bet.
Dwight,"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it."
Jim,Well I do.
Dwight,Wow.
Jim,I play.
Dwight,You can be so modest sometimes.
Jim,"Well, maybe you should get back to work."
Dwight,Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Jim,Maybe we will someday.
Dwight,Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Charles,"That's a great idea, Dwight."
Dwight,Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
Jim,Yeah.
Dwight,I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Charles,"What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?"
Dwight,"Jim, what do you say?"
Angela,Sounds fun.
Andy,I'm in it to win.
Dwight,Game on!
Charles,"Okay. See you on the field, there, bro."
Jim,Let's... eh... see ya.
Charles,"See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!"
Jim,"Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team."
Pam,We got Vikram!
Vikram,You got me.
Vikram,Where are we going?
Pam,We have a meeting with an investor today.
Michael,"Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. Ah, okay."
Vikram,He seems really confident.
Pam,He can be.
Vikram,Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
Pam,"Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram."
Michael,"Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. It's Michael."
Ryan,"I'm swamped, Michael. Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27."
Michael,"Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files."
Vikram,"He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do."
Pam,"Yes. Yes, it's possible."
Michael,"Well, it has always been a lifelong dream."
Pam,Michael! What's going on?
Michael,I'm...
Pam,"Hey, Ryan."
Ryan,"Hey, you."
Michael,Excuse me. Yes?
Pam,This wasn't on the list.
Michael,"Yes, it is."
Pam,No.
Michael,Yes.
Pam,It's not.
Michael,It is.
Pam,When did you add this to the list?
Michael,"Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?"
Ryan,Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Pam,You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
Ryan,"What do you make, secretary?"
Supervisor,"Back to work, shoe bitch!"
Ryan,"I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so..."
Michael,Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Ryan,What size shoes are you guys?
Michael,"Uh, nine."
Ryan,"What are those, a men's ten?"
Pam,No.
Michael,Look what he's doing.
Pam,What is he doing?
Michael,"He's stealing them. Okay, okay."
Pam,Oh my God.
Michael,He's already paying for himself.
Pam,Sorry!
Ryan,Where is it?
Michael,Right here.
Vikram,"Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know."
Charles,Miner -
Jim,"Oh, there he goes."
Charles,...sees his partner -
Jim,Yikes.
Charles,Halpert. He looks up!
Jim,"Aw, man."
Charles,Defending duo! He sets him up! He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Jim,Oh! Goal!
Charles,"Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you."
Jim,"Aw, it's gonna be the worst."
Ryan,Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Michael,Oh yeah.
Pam,Sure.
Ryan,It was indescribable.
Michael,Sounds awesome.
Pam,Beat.
Vikram,What sort of investing club is this?
Michal,"Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!"
Pam,Nana?
Nana,Michael!
Michael,"People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want."
Michael,"Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper."
Nana,So let's hear it.
Michael,"Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit."
Nana,How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
Michael,By wanting it more. By working hard-
Nana,What's your mission statement?
Michael,Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows
Charles,"C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?"
Dwight,Wing.
Kevin,Wag.
Charles,Jim. What do you play?
Michael,"It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. Okay. Not gonna make this one."
Michael,She did it!
Jim,LOVE the hair.
Michael,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Pam,Morning Michael!
Michael,"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important."
Michael,Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride!
Andy,Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Michael,"I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!"
Dwight,"Cherry Pie, Warrant."
Kelly,So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Andy,Better a cappella!
Jim,"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?"
Dwight,No! Really?
Kelly,And...
Andy,Yeah. Name another.
Charles,Hey Kelly?
Dwight,"Enter Sandman, Metallica."
Kelly,"Yes? Charles, you wanted me?"
Andy,Better a cappella.
Charles,"Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly."
Dwight,"Rebel Yell, Billy Idol"
Jim,"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says ""You wanted me"" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had."
Andy,Aw!! Way better a cappella
Charles,"Oh, and Kelly..."
Dwight,Really?
Kelly,"Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?"
Andy,Yeah.
Charles,"Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon."
Erin,"If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name."
Charles,"Erin. Okay, that's very pretty."
Kelly,Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Kevin,I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Michael,We are in the heart of it. And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Pam,What should we do now?
Michael,"We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon."
Michael,"I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it."
Michael,"I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service."
Pam,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet."
Andy,What do you think?
Dwight,Let me check. Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Andy,Thank you!
Dwight,"Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do."
Ryan,"You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style."
Michael,Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Ryan,"Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space."
Charles,"Hey Jim can I get a, um-"
Jim,Hi!
Charles,"Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me."
Jim,Sure!
Charles,Yeah.
Jim,Okay.
Jim,What the hell's a rundown?
Jim,When did you need that rundown by?
Charles,As soon as possible.
Jim,Okay.
Charles,Just get it right.
Jim,"Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?"
Erin,Oh.
Dwight,You know there's a ghost in this office
Erin,Really?
Dwight,A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Erin,Why was she in this building?
Dwight,"Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor."
Erin,That's crazy.
Dwight,Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Erin,Oh my god!
Dwight,It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Erin,Hmm.
Dwight,"That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next."
Erin,Oh!
Dwight,Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Erin,Yeah.
Dwight,Yeah?
Erin,Just got some ice.
Dwight,Erin Erin...
Andy,"Oh, this is awkward."
Erin,Oops!
Andy,Uh oh! Oh! Oh!
Erin,So I'll see you guys around!
Dwight,Hey buddy.
Michael,Hey Ryan? Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan,Pam's better at that stuff
Pam,That is so insulting.
Ryan,How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Pam,"Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times."
Ryan,"I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other."
Pam,Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Ryan,What the hell?
Michael,"Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals."
Ryan,Yeah I make originals too.
Pam,Shut up!
Michael,Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam,Really!
Ryan,Yeah!
Toby,"Not much? What's up with you? Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. Hey does blue go with tan?"
Michael,Would someone just make the copy?
Toby,"I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh."
Michael,Just make that copy okay?
Pam,"Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?"
Ryan,That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Pam,I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Ryan,You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Pam,Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Ryan,This is from the sun.
Pam,Oh yeah I bet.
Michael,"They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim."
Pam,"Michael, we can hear you."
Michael,"I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B."
Pam,Okay it's my turn.
Ryan,"No don't take that, give that back!"
Pam,Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Ryan,I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Pam,"You're gonna make another ""spreadsheet."""
Ryan,Yeah!
Pam,Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
Ryan,"Go make a copy, secretary."
Pam,Come on! Ryan!
Michael,"They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?"
Dwight,"Hey buddy, what are you up to?"
Andy,"Um, nerthing?"
Dwight,"Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your pen1s."
Andy,Pffft.
Dwight,"Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?"
Andy,"The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man."
Dwight,"And I, yours. So I will cede her to you."
Andy,"No, that's ridiculous."
Dwight,No no no.
Andy,"Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-"
Dwight,"Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, Boom."
Michael,Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Pam,Definitely.
Michael,Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam,We could work from home.
Ryan,Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Michael,"Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?"
Pam,.... Corner idea?
Michael,"No, you're supposed to say, ""Rock the house."""
Ryan,Rock the house!
Pam,How would we know that?
Jim,"Hey dude, you know what a ""rundown"" is?"
Oscar,Use it in a sentence.
Jim,"""Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"""
Oscar,Try another sentence.
Jim,"""This rundown better be really good""?"
Oscar,I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Jim,Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Oscar,Why don't you just ask him--
Jim,"No. I can't. It was like, hours ago."
Oscar,What have you been doing?
Kevin,Try it in another sentence.
Ryan,"Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, ""Hey cop, you like donuts?"" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. No, not that one."
Michael,That's my corner.
Pam,I thought that was your corner.
Michael,"No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work."
Pam,So my corner's the one with the copier?
Michael,"Pam, I don't make the rules."
Ryan,"Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is."
Charles,You started on that rundown yet?
Jim,"Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with."
Charles,Oh.
Jim,"I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now."
Charles,"Okay, great."
Jim,"Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?"
Charles,Just keep it simple.
Jim,Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Charles,You're working hard? On this?
Jim,No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Charles,Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Jim,"No, I...."
Erin,Can I help you?
Pam,No thanks.
Jim,Hey!
Pam,Hey I'm here to see Charles.
Jim,Okay.
Pam,Hey Charles.
Charles,Hey Pam.
Pam,I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
Charles,I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Pam,"Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now."
Charles,Um.
Pam,"Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people."
Charles,Yeah I know.
Pam,Personal shopper?
Charles,No.
Pam,Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Charles,Okay.
Pam,I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Michael,"Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour."
Stanley,I get it. You need to see more?
Phyllis,It's really cute.
Michael,Thank you. You remember Ryan And Pam is around here somewhere.
Stanley,She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Michael,What for?
Stanley,I don't know.
Ryan,Are we staying til five?
Michael,Yes.
Michael,"Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em."
Michael,"Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. Young sir, would you like a free pancake?"
Ryan,I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Michael,"Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company."
Michael,Hey Pam.
Pam,Hey.
Michael,You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Pam,"Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff."
Michael,Yeah?
Pam,That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Michael,"Well, at least you're still being honest with me."
Jim,There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Charles,Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Jim,Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Charles,Do I need to?
Jim,"No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?"
Charles,What's that?
Jim,The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Jim,Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Pam,"We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves."
Man,Do you have a card?
Pam,"Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper."
Creed,These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Michael,These are shaped like paper.
Creed,Well I don't even want these.
Meredith,I'll take them for my kid.
Erin,"Country roads, take me home, to the place... Sorry. I like that song. You're good!"
Dwight,You're good.
Erin,Thank you.
Andy,"That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like"
Erin,Wow!
Andy,What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
Dwight,"Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it."
Andy,Really?
Dwight,Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Dwight and Erin,"West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River"
Dwight,"In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend"
Dwight and Andy,"Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads."
Dwight,"Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh"
Toby,You have to stop.
Michael,"I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. It is a disgusting sandwich. And the reason I tell you this story. Pick up the phone."
Pam,"Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?"
Ryan,Keep going.
Michael,Don't tell them we have free delivery!
Pam,We already offered free delivery!
Michael,They don't know that!
Pam,"Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!"
Ryan,Write it down.
Michael,Give him a guarantee.
Pam,A guarantee of what?
Michael,Just say the word.
Pam,"And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell."
Michael,Yes!
Pam,I made a sale!
Ryan,Oh!
Michael,You did!
Pam,Oh!
Michael,Oh yeah!
Ryan,We did it !
Michael,Hup!
Kevin,I guess I could be nicer.
Pam,Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Phyllis,"Andy, I think Jim is messing with you."
Michael,Hup!
Andy,"Oh, really?"
Pam,We're getting pretty good at it.
Phyllis,Mm-hmm.
Jim,Okay.
Andy,"Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?"
Jim,"Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right."
Jim,"Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together."
Pam,The timeline's messy.
Andy,"Uh, that's not what was-"
Jim,"Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love."
Jim,"And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will."
Andy,This is my solo.
Andy,"Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours."
Pam,I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
Michael,What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
Andy,Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Dwight,It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
Jim,"I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?"
Secretary,"Uh, hello, Dwight."
Andy,"Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000."
Dwight,Spin move.
Pam,I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Secretary,Oh-
Andy,Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Dwight,"Ha ha! April 13th, 2002."
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Mr. Schofield,"Dwight, I'm in a meeting."
Phyllis,What's wrong with you?
Michael,That's very rude.
Dwight,These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Dwight,"I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased."
Phyllis,I think you look nice.
Mr. Schofield,Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
Dwight,Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Dwight,"La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!"
Charles,Looking good.
Michael,"I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin..."
Dwight,"'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! Okay."
Dwight,Come on.
Dwight,"When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared."
Michael,"Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month."
Michael,Hey.
Dwight,What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Dwight,Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Mr. Schofield,Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
Michael,Is this good?
Michael,That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Dwight,They have some great kitchen ideas.
Mr. Schofield,"Uh, ok, sure."
Michael,"Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?"
Michael,"Good, good, good. I will see you."
Dwight,"It's small, I know."
Dwight,"Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?"
Michael,I really appreciate it.
Mr. Schofield,Excuse me?
Dwight,"Thanks, Michael. Wait, what is this?"
Michael,"I color code all my info. I wrote ""gay son"" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means ""Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?"" Most colors mean ""Don't say it."""
Michael,It's for your trouble.
Dwight,"How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?"
Dwight,Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Michael,"I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess."
Michael,"No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this."
Dwight,"Michael, you know I can't take this."
Michael,"Yes, I do."
Dwight,But don't forget you owe me $10.
Michael,That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Dwight,Michael.
Andy,What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Jim,I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Andy,It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
Jim,Am I going down a road?
Andy,"When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance."
Jim,"It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this."
Andy,"I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things."
Jim,"I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up."
Michael,"Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women."
Pam,I'm not gonna do that.
Michael,That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Ryan,I can get there.
Michael,"Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce."
Ryan,"Oh, awesome."
Michael,Bring it in. Morning cheer.
"Michael, Pam & Ryan","U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!"
Pam,I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Dwight,You needed to speak to me?
Charles,"Dwight, take a seat."
Dwight,I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Charles,"Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?"
Dwight,Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Charles,I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Dwight,Your concern is noted.
Charles,"Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused."
Dwight,Like a wolf. Thank you.
Charles,And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Dwight,Really?
Charles,Definitely.
Dwight,It's firm.
Michael,I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight,"I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up."
Michael,Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Dwight,"No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast."
Michael,I'm not following you.
Dwight,"Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero."
Michael,"Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift."
Dwight,"Good, do you see what I'm saying?"
Michael,Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Dwight,No.
Michael,Can I use it?
Dwight,No.
Michael,"Dwight, are you talking about us?"
Dwight,It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Michael,Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Dwight,It is the situation that we are in now.
Michael,"So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?"
Dwight,I'm not a barbarian.
Michael,Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight,I will.
Michael,Dwight?
Dwight,Yes?
Michael,Is the cool new guy Charles?
Dwight,I've said too much.
Michael,Is it Stanley?
Jim,"Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-"
Andy,'Noishe.'
Jim,-I just don't know if I can do it.
Andy,"That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?"
Jim,"It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy."
Andy,"And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. Ah, what'd you do that for?"
Jim,You know that I was doin' this.
Andy,Totally.
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?"
Dwight,"I'm sorry, Michael"
Charles,"Hi, Michael."
Michael,Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Charles,"No, Mich-Michael."
Michael,"Dwight, run!"
Charles,"Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?"
Michael,You be cool.
Charles,Yes.
Michael,Just-what's going on?
Charles,"We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info."
Michael,Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Charles,He did.
Dwight,"I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it."
Charles,"Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?"
Michael,I. Understand. Nothing.
Michael,Wow.
Pam,"Michael, are you alright?"
Michael,It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Pam,Tell us what you're talking about.
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,"It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon."
Pam,We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Michael,"I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?"
Andy,"Hey, Jim."
Jim,I just totally blew a sales call.
Andy,"Bro, I do that all the time."
Jim,"Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!"
Andy,"Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?"
Jim,"Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back."
Andy,"Well, so what? Your body's a ten."
Jim,Forget it.
Andy,Jim.
Jim,I said forget it.
Dwight,Dwight Schrute.
Michael,"Hello, traitor."
Dwight,"I think you have the wrong number, Michael."
Michael,"I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you."
Pam,Michael!
Michael,I'm just getting hardcore with him.
Ryan,Finally.
Michael,"Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. Bill Cosby."
Dwight,"Mr. Schofield, please?"
Secretary,He's in a meeting.
Dwight,Dammit!
Michael,Is Mr. Schofield there?
Automated phone voice,"If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first."
Stanley,"So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?"
Dwight,I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Phyllis,You sound worried.
Dwight,"And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations!"
Michael,"Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?"
Ryan,Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Pam,"I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight."
Michael,Wow. High score?
Dwight,"And no, I cannot lower my current prices. Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown."
Dwight,"Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still..."
Michael,"Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?"
Dwight,I would like to arrange a truce.
Michael,"So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?"
Dwight,Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Michael,No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Dwight,Michael.
Michael,"Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet."
Dwight,In which direction?
Michael,Toward the sun.
Dwight,At what time?
Michael,Noon.
Dwight,That-
Michael,You have two seconds.
Dwight,Michael. Sorry.
Michael,Dwight.
Dwight,Michael.
Michael,I hope you're not recording this conversation. Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Dwight,You were making me do things that were not all right.
Michael,So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
Dwight,And not come through for you?
Michael,"If you want a truce, I will give you a truce."
Dwight,I want a truce.
Michael,I do too.
Dwight,Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Michael,Cooper's.
Dwight,I had fish yesterday.
Michael,Damn it.
Michael,Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Dwight,"Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic."
Michael,Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
Dwight,I hit a bear.
Michael,What?
Dwight,"He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?"
Michael,"Yeah, sure."
Dwight,"Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?"
Michael,"Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec."
Pam,Sounds neat.
Ryan,We can spend a couple days there.
Pam,"Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!"
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,Did you enjoy your lunch?
Michael,"Dwight, not now, we've been robbed."
Dwight,"No, Michael, you were sabotaged."
Michael,"No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. You?"
Dwight,Me.
Michael,What about our truce?
Dwight,I broke it.
Michael,On purpose?
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,Why?
Dwight,"You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!"
Michael,"Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it."
Dwight,And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Michael,Oh. b*st*rd!
Dwight,"Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say."
Dwight,"Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, ""great salesman, better friend."" ""Tall"" and ""beets."""
Dwight,"And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here."
Michael,"Dwight, do you mind if we talk?"
Dwight,Sure. That'd be fine.
Michael,"If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed."
Dwight,This is war and that is what happens.
Michael,"Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client."
Dwight,"Oh, no. No. No. No. No."
Michael,"Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now."
Dwight,Michael! Michael!
Michael,"You can hear me, but I can't hear you."
Secretary,"Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott."
Michael,"Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much."
Dwight,Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Michael,Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield,"Michael, good to see you."
Michael,"Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door."
Michael,"Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn."
Mr. Schofield,Really?
Michael,"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates."
Dwight,Are you saying you invented paper?
Andy,"Okay, okay."
Jim,"Oh, God."
Andy,"Okay, Tuna."
Kelly,"Hey, guys."
Jim,Hey.
Andy,Hello.
Andy,"Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now."
Michael,It's 4
Ryan,"How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000."
Michael,"Time to make the donuts. Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on. De-nied!"
Pam,Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Ryan,We've been making 5
Michael,"It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?"
Michael,"Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts! Hey Pam."
Ryan,"I would rather have $60,000, honestly."
Pam,"We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says ""Alleluia Church of Scranton."" in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it."
Pam,"No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer."
Pam,"You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?"
Michael,Agreed?
Michael,Milk and sugar.
Pam,"Agreed. But that's all, okay."
Pam,"Oh, awesome. You're a life saver. Wait, is this just milk and sugar?"
Ryan,"Yeah, discuss these things--"
Michael,That's what I said.
Michael,"Shut up, shut up. Hello?"
Pam,Do you drink this every day?
Michael,I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring.
Michael,Every morning.
Charles,They don't make them anymore.
Michael,"We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those."
Michael,And I want Charles gone.
Pam,"Oh, oh, excuse me! Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh, it's a paper company now. It's not for the church."
David,I am not firing Charles. He is very valuable.
Charles,"Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?"
Charles,"That's very kind of you to say, David."
Jim,"Oh, they're my client."
Michael,I need him gone.
Charles,"No, they were your client. They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company."
David,No.
Dwight,"Shame, Jim. I expected more."
Michael,"Okay, then I want Pam back."
Charles,In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
David,"Uh, you already have a new receptionist--"
Stanley,What are we supposed to do? They keep undercutting us on price.
Michael,Sales.
Charles,I don't want to hear excuses. I want to see improvements. This is unacceptable.
Pam,Thank you.
Andy,"Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys."
David,Pam's not a salesperson.
Charles,Why are you telling me this?
Michael,"Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday."
Andy,I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
Pam,That's right.
Charles,Is this something you really want to have said?
David,Okay. Please continue.
Andy,I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it.
Michael,And Ryan.
Charles,"I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-"
David,"Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is--"
Dwight,It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Michael,"You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me."
Charles,"I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--"
David,Do you realize what you're asking for here? You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Angela,"Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not."
Michael,And dental this time.
Charles,"Uh, well said, Angela."
David,"Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out."
Dwight,"Been there, done that."
Michael,These are our demands.
Michael,You know what we need? We need some couches in here.
David,Your company cannot be worth that much.
Ryan,"Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy."
Michael,"Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names."
Michael,"Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft."
David,Michael--
Pam,Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Michael,That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.
Michael,"Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top."
David,Okay. Deal. Okay?
Pam,"Yeah, I know what a loft is."
Michael,Can we have the room please?
Ryan,Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
David,Yeah.
Michael,Most do in the magazines.
Ryan,"Yes, yes, yes!"
Ryan,Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Pam,Alright!
Michael,We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft.
Michael,Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!
David Wallace,"Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey."
Michael,There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.
Jim,"Hey, David."
Charles,"Hey, guys--"
Dwight,"David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you."
Michael,"No, no. You're done."
Charles,There he is. There he is. How was the trip up?
David,"A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure."
Charles,"Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad. Hasn't been that bad. These people are the salt of the earth down here. You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company."
David,Hmmm.
Charles,I feel like I should be thanking you.
David,Uh.
Jim,
Charles,The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
David,"You know, I just want to address everyone first."
Charles,"Oh yeah, take your time. Stanley, pay attention."
David,"Hi, everyone."
Kelly,Hi.
David,"Hi. Uh, look it's no secret--"
Kevin,Hi.
David,"Hello. Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business. And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback."
Charles,Right.
David,Okay?
Phyllis,"Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients."
David,"I've been wondering that myself lately. We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. Jim, can you come in with us please?"
Charles,"Uh, Jim hold on. You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy. Okay?"
David,Hmm.
Charles,"Yeah, Jim--"
David,I find that extraordinarily surprising.
Charles,"He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment."
David,We'll bring them both in.
Charles,"Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim."
Dwight,"Come along, afterthought."
Michael,How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Financial Guy,"Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--"
Michael,"They are correct, sir."
Financial Guy,Then you can't afford to pay him anything.
Michael,Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.
Financial Guy,Your prices are too low.
Michael,Lowest in town.
Financial Guy,Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?
Pam,Corporate greed?
Ryan,"Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable."
Financial Guy,"Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct."
Ryan,Yeah.
Financial Guy,But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
Michael,"Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is."
Ryan,Explain what you think that is.
Financial Guy,Okay.
Michael,Explain that.
Financial Guy,"As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care..."
Michael,"Well, we don't--"
Financial Guy,...business expansion--
Michael,"Whatever, yeah."
Financial Guy,"At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make."
Michael,Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Financial Guy,They're actually putting you out of business.
Michael,"Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again."
Ty,It's a program. There's no such thing--
Michael,Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.
Ty,Crunch.
Pam,Did it help?
Michael,"Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing. Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check."
Pam,"When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, ""Drive, kid. I trust you."""
Jim,"Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?"
Charles,"God, no."
Dwight,"Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak."
Charles,I agree.
Dwight,I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.
Jim,Really? Does he do good work or--
Dwight,"No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist."
David,"Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out."
Dwight,Five minutes exactly.
Charles,"Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you?"
Dwight,Sure thing.
Charles,Yeah.
Jim,Hey. I saw you called.
Jim ,You're just out of business?
Pam,We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Jim,"Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. We'll be okay."
Pam,That's what Michael said.
Jim,"Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay. [cell phone rings"
Pam,I like it.
Jim,"Good, right? Hello."
Dwight,"Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way."
Jim,"Oh, okay. Don't worry about it."
Michael,Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Pam,"Steve Martin's not dead, Michael."
Michael,I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.
Pam,You want to hear something sad?
Michael,I would love that.
Pam,"So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview."
Ryan,I never went to Thailand.
Pam,Really?
Ryan,I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Michael,Was it nice?
Ryan,"Yeah, it was amazing. There was a great Pad Thai place, though."
Michael,I love Pad Thai.
Ryan,You've never had Pad Thai.
Michael,No. There's a lot I haven't done.
Jim,"Now, this is the projection over three months?"
Charles,We still have the inventory sitting--
Dwight,"Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something?"
David,"Yeah, yeah."
Dwight,"There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom."
David,"I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer."
Charles,"Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out."
Jim,"Oh, but you didn't."
Dwight,"Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure."
Charles,What is wrong with you?
David,"Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?"
Jim,"Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--"
David,Yeah.
Jim,I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Dwight,"You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this?"
Charles,"No, Jim... I think you should go."
Jim,"Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit."
Michael,Hmm?
Jim,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
Michael,"We're not hiring, Jim."
Jim,Actually here for something else.
Michael,"Listen, I can't make you laugh right now."
Jim,"You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales."
Ryan,"Oh, that's nice."
Jim,David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Pam,Seriously? Are you being serious?
Ryan,"He's bluffing, Pam."
Michael,"Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--"
Jim,Oh!
Michael,No-- We don't have--
Jim,Oh! See I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Michael,Uh... Yes.
Pam,Yes.
Ryan,Maybe.
Jim,Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Michael,"Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks."
Jim,Missed the last part.
Michael,That's a pun.
Jim,Got it.
Michael,Yep. Oh... wow.
Ryan,"Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we're broke."
Michael,Of course not.
Ryan,That we're having any problem at all.
Michael,"Nope, nope, nope."
Pam,"Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke."
Michael,"Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke."
Michael,"Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it."
Pam,"No, Michael."
Michael,Ah...
Ryan,"No, man. You're-- you're fine."
Pam,We have to come from a position of strength.
Michael,"I'm good, I'm good."
Ryan,Just put it out of your mind.
Michael,It is. I'm good.
Michael,Hello.
Erin,Hi.
Michael,"Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected. Well, well, well. How the turntables..."
David,"Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer."
Michael,And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Ryan,"Michael, you haven't even heard--"
Michael,Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?
David,"$12,000.00 "
Michael,Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
Angela,What do you hear?
Kelly,
David,"Here's the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get."
Michael,I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.
David,"Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000. Hmm? $60,0000. Michael?"
Michael,We'll have to talk--
Charles,What?
Ryan,We'll have to talk about this.
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Michael,Just amongst ourselves.
David,"Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time."
Michael,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
Pam,"$60,000.00 "
Michael,We are so rich.
Pam,Are you kidding me?
Dwight,"Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. Charles."
Charles,Dwight.
Dwight,May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
Charles,What? How'd you hear that?
Dwight,They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures.
Jim,Great work Dwight.
Dwight,Quiet you.
Jim,"No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?"
Dwight,"You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty."
Charles,So how long can they stay viable?
Jim,What are your top five cases?
Dwight,I'm gonna answer Charles first.
Jim,Because you've solved zero cases.
Dwight,"Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed."
Charles,"Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room."
Dwight,Done.
Charles,Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it?
Dwight,I'm not-- I'm not following you.
Charles,You two are morons.
Jim,Got it.
Dwight,Wh--
Charles,Get out.
David,"So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us? Hmm?"
Michael,No.
Pam,Can you give us another minute please?
David,Yeah.
Charles,"Oh, okay."
Pam,Michael.
Kevin,"At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?"
Jim,He definitely stole my iPod.
Ryan,Who is it?
Michael,That sounds pretty biased.
Pam,Who is it?
Jim,You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Michael,It's Michael Scott. [applause
Michael,"Okay. Pam, pros."
Michael,"Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan. And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting."
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,Wh--what are you doing?
Michael,"I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice."
Michael,"If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now."
Jim,That's not true.
Angela,Okay.
Michael,I don't need to tell you that.
Michael,Yes.
Jim,I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Angela,People are dressed inappropriately.
Michael,"I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam."
Michael,"Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different."
Jim,And I won't.
Jim,Can you give us a hint?
Michael,"Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan."
Michael,"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that."
Jim,"All right. You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice."
Michael,"Oscar, what were you going to say?"
Michael,"Oh, wow! Whoa!"
Oscar,Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Jim,Take it easy.
Michael,All right.
Michael,"Ho-ho, man! Wow. Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have s*x with you unless you bring out the garba--"
Erin,Do I still have a job here?
Michael,I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Michael,"Not important. Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen."
Andy,"You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki."
Dwight,"Wait, what?"
Toby,"All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights."
Stanley,How is that going to work?
Dwight,"Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants."
Michael,"It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--"
Toby,"All right, come. Sit down, Dwight."
Phyllis,You mean the clients you stole from us.
Dwight,No.
Dwight,"Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?"
Toby,I'm running this meeting.
Michael,"No, you lost those clients."
Dwight,That's debatable.
Andy,"I call foul, sir."
Toby,It's not. It's not. Sit down or I am writing you up.
Michael,Okay.
Meredith,"Ooh, where has this guy been?"
Dwight,You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Toby,Casual Fridays are cancelled. Let's just not do it anymore.
Michael,"Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can."
Andy,You're running from the problem.
Meredith,"Don't fall in love with me, kid."
Toby,"There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly."
Pam,Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
Michael,"Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat. Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--"
Phyllis,It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Pam,Just tell me.
Pam,"Well, you have good taste."
Michael,I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--
Phyllis,"Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though."
Pam,"No, okay."
Pam,What?
Michael,"I'm sorry, sorry."
Phyllis,Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them?
Pam,"Okay, I get it. Why are you giggling? Is this a joke? Michael, is this-- did I get the job?"
Pam,"Oh, I, um..."
Michael,"Yes, you did."
Phyllis,"Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout."
Pam,I did?
Angela,The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Michael,Yep.
Toby,Can't you just not look at his feet?
Pam,"For real, you're not kidding?"
Angela,"Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. Do your job!"
Michael,"No, you--no."
Toby,"Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have s*x with this girl, Cathy. Followed her to Scranton. Took the first job I could find in H.R. Later she divorced me. So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R."
Pam,I did?
Michael,"There you are, my friend."
Michael,"No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great."
Ryan,"Oh, thanks, man."
Pam,"Oh, Michael, thank you. Thank you."
Michael,Pamela.
Michael,"Oh, oh!"
Pam,"Thank, Michael."
Pam,Thank you. You will not be sorry.
Michael,Yep.
Michael,"You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic."
Dwight,Fresh hot ink.
Pam,Oh. I really thought I didn't get it.
Stanley,"""New File System""."
Michael,"Oh, really?"
Dwight,"Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully."
Pam,Yeah. 'Cause you said I didn't
Stanley,I am not changing the way I do my files.
Michael,"Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good."
Dwight,"No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words."
Pam,What about Ryan?
Dwight,When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.
Michael,"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--"
Oscar,"I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change."
Pam,Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Toby,I could loan you a pair of socks.
Michael,"I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here."
Oscar,No.
Pam,"Thanks, Michael."
Toby,"No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later."
Michael,Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Oscar,I don't think so.
Pam,Erin.
Andy,Andrew Bernard.
Michael,Could you send her in?
Dwight,"Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?"
Pam,Erin. Michael wants to see you.
Andy,What are you still doing not at your desk?
Michael,Hello.
Dwight,Did you even read the memo?
Erin,Hi.
Andy,All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Michael,Have a seat.
Dwight,"No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto."
Michael,"This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go. Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--"
Andy,"Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn."
Erin,"Oh, I can go."
Dwight,"Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing."
Michael,He will be ushering you out.
Dwight,"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone."
Erin,Oh!
Jim,Can I address that?
Michael,"Oh, your face! Oh!"
Dwight,"No, you're too close."
Erin,Is--do the people--
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet."
Dwight,"Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?"
Erin,Oh!
Stanley,It's not right. I don't like it.
Michael,Oh...
Dwight,He doesn't like it.
Erin,"Do they not like me, though?"
Phyllis,"You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty."
Michael,"I don't know, actually."
Dwight,"Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?"
Erin,Okay.
Meredith,I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Dwight,Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Phyllis,Those sound too harsh.
Dwight,"No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things."
Jim,Of course. What is like a hostage?
Dwight,Excellent question.
Andy,We could write a strong-worded letter.
Dwight,Words will never be enough.
Jim,Strongly-painted picture.
Dwight,"No, pictures are too interpretive."
Jim,"Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly."
Dwight,"Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs."
Jim,Great. See you upstairs.
Dwight,"C'mon. Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--"
Pam,That one's great.
Michael,I know.
Ryan,You look so classy in that picture.
Michael,I do? Well--Where is that bowl?
Jim,"Hey, you have a second?"
Michael,Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Jim,"Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen."
Michael,"Okay, well---"
Ryan,Tough.
Michael,"I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom."
Jim,"This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now."
Michael,Against who?
Ryan,You. Us.
Pam,What?
Ryan,It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Michael,"The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with."
Michael,"Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow."
Pam,Mm-hmmm.
Michael,"That was us, right there."
Pam,We were something else.
Ryan,What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Ryan,Chiklis style.
Michael,"Yeah, the Commish."
Ryan,"Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style."
Michael,"Yeah, yeah. The Shield."
Creed,"It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?"
Jim,"I know. Yeah, it's...kinda--"
Creed,Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
Jim,That's true. That's right. Yeah.
Creed,Want to play a game?
Michael,Hey gang. Where you been?
Dwight,Lunch.
Michael,Where'd you eat?
Phyllis,A restaurant.
Michael,"What'd you have, Stanley?"
Andy,"I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it. Her name was Flo, she had black hair."
Stanley,I had Mexican food.
Michael,"So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon."
Ryan,That looks great.
Michael,"Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?"
Ryan,I can eat.
Michael,I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Dwight,It's pony.
Michael,Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Andy,Dijonnaise.
Michael,"Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys."
Pam,Mmm.
Toby,"Hey, Meredith. Can I talk to you privately for a second?"
Meredith,About what?
Toby,Your outfit.
Meredith,What? What's wrong with my outfit?
Toby,You--you might consider pulling it down a touch. It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
Meredith,"A bunch of prudes. You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals, but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes? Is that how it goes?"
Oscar,"Meredith, your boob is out."
Meredith,Fine.
Angela,"Meredith, too far!"
Kelly,"Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?"
Meredith,It's casual day. Happy?
Creed,"No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that."
Jim,"Well, what if I just do this?"
Creed,You don't want to do that.
Jim,I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Ryan,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?"
Dwight,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone."
Ryan,Exactly.
Dwight,That's my client.
Ryan,Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.
Dwight,Give me the phone.
Ryan,Things have been generally good.
Dwight,Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Ryan,"Look, uh, Mr. Bart..."
Dwight,"Hi, Mr. Bart."
Ryan,At these prices with this service...
Dwight,"Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone."
Ryan,You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up."
Ryan,"No, no, no. Sir, don't listen."
Dwight,"I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness. Ryan!"
Phyllis,"Ryan, hand the phone over."
Ryan,"Stop flustering me, everybody!"
Stanley,Who let this boy on the phone?
Dwight,Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!
Pam,"You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan."
Dwight,You're a secretary! What do you know?
Ryan,Okay.
Dwight,And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.
Michael,"Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight."
Dwight,"We want our clients back or we quit, Michael."
Michael,Who quits?
Phyllis,Me.
Stanley,And me.
Andy,Me too.
Michael,You guys gotta be kidding.
Dwight,"No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company."
Michael,"I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money. There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one."
Stanley,You want us to apologize to you?
Michael,Yes I do.
Andy,That's completely backwards.
Michael,It's frontward's.
Phyllis,"Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us."
Stanley,That's right.
Dwight,Right.
Phyllis,"Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us."
Michael,"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy."
Michael,I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Dwight,Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Michael,Whatever you guys did earlier.
Dwight,I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Michael,"Just do it, okay?"
Dwight,I'll do--
Michael,Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
Dwight,I'll do the best I can.
Michael,Are you kidding me?
Dwight,Deceit does not come easy to me.
Michael,"Okay, okay, okay."
Erin,I really love your outfit.
Kelly,Thank you so much for saying that. I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Erin,You look like J-Lo.
Michael,"So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry."
Stanley,Are you giving us our clients back?
Michael,"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, ""apology accepted"", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark."
Stanley,Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Michael,They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Phyllis,"Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about."
Michael,"Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople."
Stanley,So?
Michael,"Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. However, I rescind my apology."
Dwight,That's fair.
Michael,You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Darryl,What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Ryan,"Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on."
Pam,He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
Ryan,I think you should get it. You really grew into it.
Pam,Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Ryan,"If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you."
Pam,Yeah.
Ryan,Thanks.
Creed,"So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter."
Jim,"Oh, I'm engaged to Pam."
Creed,I thought you were gay.
Jim,Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Creed,I don't know.
Michael,Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Jim,Sure. Let me just finish this turn.
Michael,And Bingo was his name. Let's go.
Creed,Challenge.
Michael,I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Jim,"I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that."
Michael,You're close with Pam too.
Jim,"Eh, she's nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list."
Michael,"Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice."
Jim,"Well, that's--"
Michael,I like his hair.
Jim,"Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale."
Erin,Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest!
Jim,Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Erin,Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Michael,"Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to ""Y""."
Dwight,Shut up.
Pam,This is so cheesy.
Dwight,I got her!
Jim,Yes.
Pam,"Not cool, Dwight."
Pam,I like cheesy.
Jim,Not cool.
Jim,"Me, too."
Michael,"Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso."
Pam,"Yeah. I think maybe I want a ""wedding"" wedding."
Michael,"Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?"
Jim,"Me, too."
Dwight,I do.
Pam,Really?
Michael,Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,"Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor."
Michael,Would you like to dance?
Michael,"Oh, really? Ok."
Angela,No.
Pam,Just sent it.
Andy,"Yeah. No. Well, ok."
Michael,What about the rest of you?
Kelly,Stop squirming.
Michael,"At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people."
Andy,"Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing."
Michael,Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Kelly,You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Ryan,I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Andy,"I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional."
Ryan,"Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control."
Kelly,I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Michael,Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Andy,"Are you sure that's not the ""gay"" ear?"
Angela,No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Kelly,Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Phyllis,"Michael, we have a lot of work to do."
Andy,"Well, I..."
Michael,What?
Kelly,"Look, I'm gonna count to 3."
Phyllis,Work.
Andy,Count to twen - count to twenty.
Michael,Ugh! God! What happened to you people? We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
Kelly,No. I'm gonna count to 3.
Pam,"If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day."
Andy,K
Pam,"Oh, no. Your battery fell out."
Kelly,1... 2... 3
Michael,I... was just learning... to... love.
Andy,Agh! Son of a bitch!
Erin,"Hi, guys. How you doing?"
Kelly,"Andy, that was just the ice."
Dwight,"Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us."
Andy,It was?
Erin,Right. I'm sorry.
Kelly,Yeah. It was.
Dwight,"Now, how can I help you?"
Erin,"Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?"
Dwight,"Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -"
Pam,So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Dwight,"It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate."
Erin,Sure.
Jim,There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Pam,We're getting married today.
Jim,"So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period."
Pam,Tell 'em how it happened.
Jim,"Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated."
Pam,And very expensive.
Jim,Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Pam,You can't leave anyone out.
Jim,No one.
Pam,"Ok, just get to the good part."
Jim,"Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, "" You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."""
Pam,I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Erin,Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Michael,No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Erin,"Well, I like to swim."
Michael,That's good.
Erin,You have a cool place to come hang.
Michael,"If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so..."
Erin,Thanks.
Michael,"Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah."
Erin,Wow.
Michael,Now you got it.
Erin,Now I do got it.
Michael,"Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?"
Erin,"Oh, yeah."
Michael,You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Erin,That's rule #1.
Michael,Ok. I love it. I love it.
Erin,Whew.
Michael,I love it.
Michael,"Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone."
Michael,"Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like Dave died or something."
Michael,Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Oscar,Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Michael,I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy,Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Michael,Andy's afwaid?
Andy,Yes.
Michael,Are you all afwaid?
Dwight,No.
Michael,Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Pam,What?
Michael,Funk is the problem and the solution.
Jim,That makes sense.
Michael,I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Oscar,Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael,"Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it."
Dwight,All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Meredith,This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Michael,"No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco."
Andy,It's like a haunted disco.
Michael,... with coffee but without the haunted.
Phyllis,It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Michael,It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Erin,It's a cafe disco.
Michael,Exactly.
Kevin,"So, like, a disco cafe?"
Michael,Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Michael,"Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you."
Kevin,Yeah.
Michael,Holdin' down the fort.
Kevin,Yeah. This place is great.
Michael,Thank you.
Angela,"Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up."
Kevin,I'm sorry.
Michael,This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin,Yeah. Respect the lei.
Angela,Come.
Michael,"Kevin, stay."
Angela,"Kevin, come."
Michael,"Kevin, stay."
Angela,"Kevin, come."
Michael,"Stay, stay."
Angela,"Come on, right now."
Michael,"Cookie. Kevin, cookie."
Angela,"Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin."
Kevin,Is there a cookie?
Michael,Mmm-hmm.
Angela,Wha -
Michael,Come on.
Angela,"Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come."
Kevin,I wanted a cookie.
Angela,Completely unacceptable.
Michael,"Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster."
Andy,"Everybody Dance Now"", spins in chair] Oww!"
Phyllis,"Aw, what the hell? Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?"
Jessica,"Oh, he's on a call."
Phyllis,"Oh, I'll just duck my head in."
Jessica,It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Phyllis,Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Jessica,I'll let him know.
Phyllis,Mmm-hmm.
Michael,Phyllis?
Phyllis,Hi.
Michael,Hey!
Phyllis,Hey. I like.
Michael,Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Phyllis,Oh! Mother ******!
Michael,"Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!"
Phyllis,Back!
Michael,"Oh, wow! What did you do?"
Phyllis,
Michael,You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Phyllis,Wow! Sorry!
Michael,"Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie."
Dwight,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?"
Michael,No. No. No.
Dwight,Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Phyllis,It's my back.
Michael,It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
Phyllis,Call a doctor.
Michael,We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Phyllis,No. Call Bob.
Michael,"Oh, no. No. No. This is no good."
Dwight,Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Michael,I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Dwight,What do you think history is?
Michael,"It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat."
Michael,Alright. Here we go.
Dwight,Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Michael,You having fun?
Erin,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
Michael,"What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you."
Phyllis,What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight,You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Michael,"Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry."
Oscar,What happened to Phyllis?
Michael,"Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So..."
Angela,Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Michael,Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.
Stanley,I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Michael,You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Erin,Yes.
Michael,I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Erin,Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Michael,I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
Dwight,I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Kelly,Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Erin,You're bad.
Vance Refrigeration Guy 1,There's girl in there.
Vance Refrigeration Guy 2,Where?
VRG 1,The other room?
VRG 2,What other room?
VRG 1,Down the hall.
VRG 2,There's girls in there?
VRG 1,What'd I just say?
VRG 2,You have another sandwich?
VRG 1,Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.
Michael,I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Dwight,"You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?"
Phyllis,Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight,"Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?"
Phyllis,I do.
Dwight,No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Andy,Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
Erin,Ashley! You made it!
Oscar,You invited someone?
Erin,"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?"
Oscar,I've been here 8 years and I've never... Rude.
Andy,"I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!"
Michael,Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Creed,"I hear it, too, Boss."
Michael,It's better than I imagined it!
Phyllis,"That feels good, Dwight."
Dwight,Tell me where it hurts.
Phylis,Right... mmmm... right there.
Dwight,Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Michael,"Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott."
Erin,"Hey, Angela! Welcome to -"
Angela,Stop!
Michael,Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Angela,No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Michael,Oh. Alright. There you go.
Angela,No. You need to sign them all.
Michael,No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
Angela,"Look, I hate to be ""that"" person but I just don't like the general spirit of music."
Michael,"I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, "" This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you."" No."
Dwight,"This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour."
Phyllis,An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
Dwight,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa."
Creed,"Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here."
Michael,"Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place."
Creed,No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Dwight,I'm gonna with the python.
Phyllis,But the rattler's so scary.
Dwight,No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Phyllis,I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.
Dwight,What's so funny?
Phyllis,When I say it out loud it's so silly.
Michael,"Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!"
Angela,You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Michael,No... cleaning... up.
Jim,These are for you.
Pam,They're beautiful.
Jim,You ready?
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Michael,Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
Phyllis,"Wanna dance, Dwight?"
Dwight,"Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic."
Bob Vance,Mind if I steal my wife?
Dwight,You can't steal what is legally your property.
Bob Vance,Are those staples?
Andy,This dance competition is not over.
Kelly,"What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all."
Michael,You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Jim,We're gonna stay.
Michael,Really?
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back."
Michael,"Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them."
Jim,"Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5"
Holly,"Well, I'm glad we did it."
Jim,"Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?"
Michael,Me too. We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Pam,I can do it.
Holly,I can't wait.
Dwight,What do you need from me?
Jim,"Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!"
Dwight,"Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken."
Nurse,"To be safe, we should do an x-ray."
Michael,
Pam,How long will that take?
Dwight,Like clockwork.
Nurse,"Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant..."
Jim,"Three, two, one..."
Pam,"I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to."
Michael,Uh oh. What's so funny?
Nurse,"Oh good, because my next question was ""do you have a game to get back to."""
Pam,You had to be there.
Holly,What'd you think?
Michael,"Oh yay! Geography joke. Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale."
AJ,"I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but..."
Michael,See you later!
Michael,Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Dwight,Bye Michael! Yeah!
Holly,Okay. So good to see you.
Jim,"All right, you ready for this?"
Michael,Good to see you. AJ.
Pam,"Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?"
AJ,Michael.
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush."
Pam,Okay.
David,"Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs."
Jim,"Wait, should I have left the car running?"
Charles,"Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?"
Pam,"Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics."
Dwight,Okay. Fine.
Jim,"Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?"
Charles,All right! Come on.
Pam,Tell them what happened last year.
Dwight,"Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?"
Jim,I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Andy,Dwight.
Pam,"No, no, that guy who hit on me."
Dwight,"No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?"
Jim,"Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance."
David,Dwight.
Pam,"Yeah, you don't grab these for balance."
Dwight,Seven? Can I finish please?
Jim,Well...
David,Okay.
Dwight,I'm gonna say 30.
Dwight,Eight?
Rolph,"Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF."
Jim,"Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! Ohh!"
Dwight,"Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent."
Rolph,Woah. Homemade?
Dwight,Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
Dwight,Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Kevin,"Michael, isn't that Holly?"
Michael,"We're just friends. Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know."
Holly,"Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here."
Michael,"Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right."
Holly,All right.
Michael,All right. Mmhmm. Hey.
Holly,"Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?"
Michael,"A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people."
AJ,Hey Michael.
Michael,Hey. Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Holly,Lemonade sounds great.
Michael,Okay.
AJ,"I'd love an iced tea, actually."
Michael,"You can go to hell. I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world."
Michael,"I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one"
Charles,Jim. Pam.
Jim,"Hey, how are you?"
Pam,Hey Charles.
Charles,"Nice day, huh?"
Jim,Yeah.
Charles,Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest.
Jim,I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Pam,Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Jim,"No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it."
Dwight,Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Jim,"Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards."
Dwight,"Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!"
Andy,"Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?"
Dwight,Why? I don't understand.
Andy,If-
Dwight,"Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it."
Andy,Uh...
Dwight,"I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team."
Andy,That's...
Dwight,Sly dog.
Andy,... not what I meant.
Dwight,"Come on, folks!"
Michael,"What is up with you two, Holly?"
Holly,"Um, not much."
AJ,We're designing a house.
Michael,Cool. For who?
AJ,For us.
Michael,"Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported."
Holly,I remember your chair pants idea.
AJ,I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
Michael,"All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse."
Holly,"Okay, yeah."
AJ,You guys are really gonna do this?
Michael,You bet your fat ass we are.
Michael,"Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin."
Holly,"Yep, the old comedy team is back together again."
Michael,That's right.
Holly,Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
Michael,Newspapers for sale!
Andy,"Are you blind?! Are you blind?! Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger."
Man,"These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass."
Andy,"Okay, I was just looking out for you. You're doing great, by the way."
Erin,Thanks.
Kevin,I got it.
Dwight,"Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!"
Andy,Are you blind?!
Dwight,"I could've gotten that, idiot!"
Andy,Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
Dwight,"It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!"
Phyllis,We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Dwight,
Dwight,"Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net."
Woman,So what?
Dwight,"Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?"
Pam,"Back off, Dwight. Hyuh! What?"
Pam,Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Pam,"Hyuh! Well, look at that, we win!"
Jim,"Nice job, Beesly."
Dwight,Yes! We advance to the next round!
Phyllis,"Oh, Lord in heaven."
Stanley,Had to be part of the group.
Michael,"I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry."
Holly,"Ooh, yes please. Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?"
Michael,What?
Holly,"Do you have a script for the sketch, or..."
Michael,"Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?"
Holly,Crystal cool.
Dwight,Hit it Andy!
Andy,Bump! I bumped it!
Kevin,Set!
Dwight,Don't set it to yourself!
Kevin,Yeah!
Phyllis,"Ow, my ankle!"
Dwight,What happened?
Phyllis,I... twisted it.
Dwight,"You weren't even moving. Okay, sub!"
Angela,I can play.
Rolph,Is there a... Meredith here?
Meredith,Yeah! Man in!
Angela,"Rolph, did you not hear me?"
Rolph,"I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!"
Michael,We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Holly,We could do Back to the Future.
Michael,Oh!
Holly,We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents.
Michael,Could we get a Delorean?
Holly,Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Michael,Oh! Dun-der. Dun-der...
Holly,Dun-der. Dun-der...
Michael,Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!
Holly,Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Michael,No. No.
Holly,Oh.
Michael,We're circling it.
Holly,Hmm...
David,Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Charles,Yes we are!
Rolph,You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
Dwight,"Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-"
Rolph,It's true!
Toby,"Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall."
Kendall,"Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious."
Toby,"Really, really funny."
Kendall,Really funny.
Dwight,"Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate."
Oscar,Settle down gentlemen.
Pam,Good game!
David,"Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song."
Michael,"Uh, it's a sketch now."
David,"Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this."
Michael,"And now, presenting..."
Both,SlumDunder Mifflinaire!
Michael,
Holly,Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Michael,"Yes, I am."
Holly,"For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?"
Michael,"Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College."
Holly,That is correct! How did you know that?!
Michael,Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Holly,Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Michael,"Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in."
Holly,I'm Robert Dunder.
Michael,"I'm Robert Mifflin. Ah, okay."
Holly,"Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!"
Michael,"Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head."
Holly,That is correct!
Michael,Yes!
Stanley,"I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful."
Holly,"The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!"
Michael,"I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!"
Holly,That is correct!
Man from Buffalo,What is he talking about?
Holly,How did you know that?!
Michael,David Wallace told me!!
Woman from Buffalo,"David, is this true?"
David,"Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today..."
Man from Buffalo,"Are we losing our jobs or not, David?"
Holly,They didn't know?
Michael,I guess not.
David,"I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch."
Woman from Buffalo,And?
David,We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
Man from Buffalo,You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it.
David,How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Michael,Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
David,"What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, ""oh, this would be really funny."""
Michael,Thank you.
David,"Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, ""is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?"""
Michael,"Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts."
Meredith,Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
Dwight,"Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever."
Pam,How do you figure?
Dwight,"Because if we don't play, then the other team wins."
Oscar,Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Pam,Let's do this.
Andy,"Jim, come on!"
Charles,Look who just woke up! I've been up for a while.
Kevin,It's six to six. It's a nail-biter.
Angela,"Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?"
Rolph,Here's an accounting question for you
Dwight,"Okay, knock it off, Rolph."
Rolph,"What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-"
Dwight,"Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-"
Rolph,No way! You don't mean that!
Dwight,"Rolph, leave it alone!"
Erin,Yeah! Boo-yah!
Pam,I got it!
Dwight,Pam!
Pam,Oof!
Jim,You all right?
Pam,"Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine."
Jim,You sure?
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,"Hey, easy, easy..."
Charles,"Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at."
Pam,"No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second."
Charles,"I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?"
David,Yeah.
Jim,"All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player."
Charles,"Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health."
Jim,"No, uh-"
Pam,"Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!"
Charles,"Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot."
Dwight,Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Charles,"I guess that's it for you, Jim."
Jim,"All right, you know what? Let's do this."
Pam,We'll be back!
Dwight,"Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! I'll get it."
Michael,Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Holly,Hindsight.
Michael,Should've had hindsight.
Holly,How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Michael,I think it went well. I think it was good.
Holly,There weren't any laughs.
Michael,"No, it was a tough audience."
Holly,"Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience."
Michael,Parkour!
Pam,Michael? He's over here!
Dwight & Andy,
Pam,Where are you going?
Andy,Parkour!
Michael,Nowhere.
Dwight,Extreme! Parkour!
Dwight,"Michael... You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?"
Jim,"This... is Parkour. Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital."
Pam,Don't get on it.
Dwight,
Jim,"Michael, don't."
Dwight & Andy,Parkour! Parkour!
Pam,Don't... get... on. Do not.
Dwight,Andy! Leapfrog!
Jim,Michael...
Andy,Do me! Do me!
Kevin,Stay.
Dwight,Yeah! Parkour! Parkour!
Pam,Step away.
Andy,Ow! Get off! Get off!
Creed,"Come on, boss."
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,
Andy & Michael,Parkour! Parkour!
Michael,"Okay, I made it all up."
Dwight,Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!
Everyone,
Michael,"Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time."
Andy,Even the fact that I'm gay?
Andy,"Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can."
Michael,Yes.
Michael & Dwight,Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo!
Andy,Yes!
Andy,Hardcore Parkour!
Michael,"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model."
Michael,Parkoooooour!
Angela,No. We heard that about Jim.
Dwight,Let's do it!
Michael,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself."
Andy,
Angela,How is that a bad rumor?
Michael & Dwight,
Michael,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit."
Andy,Parkour!
Oscar,"Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog..."
Dwight,Good. Excellent. Thank you.
Stanley,You told everyone I was having an affair?
Female Intern,There you go. Is there anything else I can do?
Michael,"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person."
Dwight,Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
Kelly,"Well then, what's the one true rumor?"
Female Intern,Mm hmm.
Phyllis,We have a right to know.
Dwight,Go put them all in random order.
Andy,Michael... am I gay?
Female intern,Mm-kay.
Michael,"The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that..."
Dwight,Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Jim,That Pam's pregnant.
Pam,"This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. He didn't do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program."
Angela,I knew it!
Meredith,Think she did him?
Kevin,"I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought ""Oh, she has a new bra with padding."" But then I thought ""Pam doesn't need padding."" It just didn't add up, Jim."
Oscar,"I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer."
Jim,Okay. Thank you.
Kelly,"If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself."
Phyllis,Congratulations!
Michael,Who's getting married?
Erin,"That's really great, you guys."
Pam,Nobody.
Ryan,Don't vaccinate it.
Michael,"If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming."
Dwight,Who's the father?
Kelly,It's Eric and Megan.
Pam,Jim.
Michael,"Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly."
Creed,How far along?
Phyllis,They're not getting married. It's just talk.
Jim,Four months.
Michael,Did everybody know about this but me?
Creed,Who's the OB/GYN?
Phyllis,"There's nothing to know, it's just gossip."
Pam,Stop. Don't. Just...
Michael,Okay... okay.
Michael,"Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair."
Pam,We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
Jim,Nope.
Jim,"Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day."
Michael,Yes. Jim...
Pam,"Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum."
Jim,"Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it."
Jim,"Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?"
Pam,Yes.
Pam,Nope.
Jim,If everyone would like to see proof.
Jim,No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
Pam,Okay.
Pam,"Can't back out now, Halpert."
Kelly,Are we just gonna wait here?
Jim,"What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!"
Everyone,
Pam,"No, keep it up."
Kelly,It's true!
Michael,You'll never guess what I know.
Michael,Look at that! That is the inside of your v*g1n*!
Dwight,"Okay, let me finish this thought."
Pam,It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now.
Michael,Eric likes Megan.
Michael,How long have you known about the pregnancy?
Dwight,He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night
Jim & Pam,
Michael,How do you know this?
Michael,A week? A month? A year?
Dwight,"People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?"
Jim,"Michael, we only told our parents last week."
Michael,"I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?"
Michael,Did you pee on a stick?
Michael,"Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said ""The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."""
Jim,I did. It was inconclusive.
Maurie,What are you talking about?
Michael,You should've told me.
Michael,I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
Pam,You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
Maurie,At Tink's?
Michael,
Michael,Yes
Erin,"Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call."
Maurie,How'd you know about that?
Michael,
Michael,Well...
Pam,You called Stanley's wife?
Maurie,Did Stanley tell you?
Michael,"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God."
Michael,Stanley was on your group date?
Jim,Don't take it.
Maurie,"No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back."
Michael,"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious."
Michael,Does anybody else know about this?
Pam,"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious."
Maurie,No.
Michael,"No, no, I can do this."
Michael,
Jim,You can't do this.
Michael,There he goes. There he goes.
Michael,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over."
Michael,"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?"
Jim,That sounds terrible.
"Dwight, Jim & Pam",
Pam,"Michael, please don't."
Michael,Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
Michael,"Hey, what up, Cynthia?"
Pam,Just keep it to yourself then.
Jim,
Michael,Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
Michael,"Hold on a second, Cynthia."
Dwight,Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
Jim,
Michael,"Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people."
Michael,"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try."
Phyllis,"Teri's out of town, Michael."
Maurie,"I learned that a company can describe their internship as ""full of exciting experiences,"" even if that's a lie. There's no regulation."
Michael,Who?
Megan,"I learned that half these people's email password is ""password."""
Phyllis,"Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts."
Eric,I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.
Michael,
Megan,I thought it was 500.
Michael,You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
Eric,Oh... I guess I didn't learn anything.
Maurie,What are you talking about?
Maurie,"I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you ""Jet Li"" all summer."
Michael,Stanley's wife is out of town.
Megan,Julia Stiles.
Maurie,He was with somebody.
Eric,Alan Thicke.
Eric,He was definitely with somebody.
Michael,"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?"
Eric,
Michael,I don't get it!
Eric,"If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal."
Michael,Drugs?
Eric,Making out.
Michael,Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
Michael,Stanley is having an affir.
Kelly,WHAT??
Michael,"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention."
Michael,That and that are the same letter.
Kevin,Q.
Michael,"No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?"
Kevin,T.
Michael,"T! Yes! Yes! That is a ""T"", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there."
Michael,"Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?"
Stanley,I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
Michael,"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?"
Stanley,Goodbye.
Michael,Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
Jim,You have to stop this.
Michael,Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
Jim,I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Michael,"Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser..."
Jim,Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Michael,
Michael,"Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. Stanley, are you having an affair?"
Stanley,"That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?"
Michael,"So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip."
Stanley,Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
Michael,So stupid!
Stanley,It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
Michael,"I know, I know."
Stanley,And it's been lonely.
Michael,"Oh, I bet."
Stanley,"Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't..."
Michael,"Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?"
Stanley,"Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear."
Michael,"Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool."
Stanley,"I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please."
Michael,I'm not saying... a damn thing.
Stanley,"I'm counting on you, Michael."
Michael,You can count on me.
Stanley,
Michael,"Oh, that smells good."
Kevin,"I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat."
Michael,Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Kevin,Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
Michael,"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike."
Kevin,Reeeeally.
Michael,Uh huh. Alright?
Michael,"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including ""Stanley is having an affair."" It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit."
Erin,Kelly has an eating disorder?
Michael,Yeah.
Erin,She always eats my lunch.
Michael,Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Erin,We should do something.
Michael,"Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess."
Michael,"I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here."
Kelly,Really?
Michael,Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
Kelly,Andy Bernard??
Michael,Mm hmm.
Michael,Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
Meredith,Really?
Michael,Yeah!
Meredith,She's gonna hate being a mom.
Andy,
Kevin,
Andy,What?
Kevin,Tea.
Andy,So?
Kevin,You would.
Andy,I like tea!
Kevin,"Oh, I bet you like it."
Andy,Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
Kevin,Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Andy,WHAT??
Kevin,Because you're gay.
Andy,Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Andy,"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. But it makes you wonder."
Andy,Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
Oscar,I did. Yes.
Andy,And?
Oscar,What?
Andy,Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Oscar,Are you attracted to other men?
Andy,"No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like."
Oscar,
Andy,"Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?"
Oscar,"If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?"
Andy,"It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario."
Oscar,Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Oscar,What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Phyllis,How far along is Pam?
Meredith,"A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding."
Michael,"Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go."
Michael,"Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors."
Dwight,"Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night."
Eric,Why would we call you at night?
Dwight,Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
Jim,You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Dwight,"Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be."
Erin,I am so happy you're eating again.
Kelly,Me too!
Andy,"Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?"
Jim,"Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though."
Andy,Women friends?
Jim,Yep.
Andy,Not guy friends?
Jim,Are you... interested in her guy friends?
Andy,"No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women."
Jim,Okay.
Andy,"But off the record, I'm kinda confused."
Jim,Really.
Andy,"Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like..."
Jim,Well you gotta figure this out.
Andy,"Yeah, right?"
Jim,Yeah!
Andy,How?
Jim,You gotta have s*x with a woman.
Andy,Right-o.
Jim,And a man.
Andy,Ohh...
Jim,And then compare.
Andy,Alright. Well hey...
Jim,Yep.
Andy,Congratulations to you.
Jim,On what?
Andy,Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
Jim,
Angela,Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a b*st*rd?
Pam,What?
Angela,Want me to say it again?
Pam,Why did that come into your brain?
Jim,Can I talk to you for a second?
Jim,"So, they know."
Pam,Who did you tell?
Jim,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Pam,Nobody!
Creed,"Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba."
Creed,"If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?"
Oscar,What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Toby,What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Jim,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?"
Everyone,Yes.
Michael,"Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors."
Jim,"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?"
Michael,"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap."
Pam,"Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning."
Kevin,"I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?"
Creed,I heard that from... Andy.
Andy,I heard it from Erin.
Erin,I heard it from Michael.
Michael,
Michael,Yeah?
Dwight,I'm... I was making it.
Oscar,You wanted to see me?
Michael,"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager."
Michael,"Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me."
Stanley,Co-manager of what?
Oscar,Yeah sure.
Michael,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts."
Michael,I'm going in for a procedure today.
Phyllis,What's happening to you Michael?
Oscar,Is everything okay?
Michael,"What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome."
Michael,"Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared."
Jim,Thank you.
Oscar,"I'm sure everything will be fine. What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?"
Dwight,AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Michael,It is a colonoscopy.
Meredith,"Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah."
Oscar,Okay.
Pam,Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Michael,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?"
Meredith,"Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier."
Oscar,Oh my God.
Pam,"Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging..."
Michael,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?"
Meredith,"I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you."
Oscar,Yeah.
Pam,"You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding."
David Wallace,"So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?"
Meredith,Uh huh.
Michael,"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night."
Pam,To ask for directions..
David,"Okay, I will look at it Monday."
Meredith,Right...
Michael,"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds."
Pam,And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
David,"Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?"
Meredith,Unless there's ribs.
Jim,Sure.
Angela,Rude.
Pam,"Hey, Good luck."
Pam,"So rude, right?"
Michael,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now. What's this about?"
Angela,Mmm hmmm.
Jim,"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay."
Pam,"Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible."
Michael,It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
Angela,"Pam, my bag was there..."
David,"No, ah it's okay Michael. We got it."
Michael,Really?
David,Yeah.
Michael,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out."
David,Okay.
Michael,"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting."
Michael,Hey let me escort you to your desk.
Pam,"Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you."
Michael,"You and Jim are close, huh?"
Pam,"Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together."
Michael,"Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you..."
Pam,"Ummm, I don't know."
Michael,"Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in."
Pam,"Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious."
Michael,"If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk."
Pam,Please don't talk about my breast milk.
Michael,I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,I just don't want you to.
Darryl,"I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me."
Toby,And that's how you broke your ankle?
Darryl,Yes.
Dwight,"Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?"
Darryl,"This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away."
Dwight,"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden."
Darryl,"If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare."
Dwight,"Nnnnn, that's not... okay."
Darryl,Be quiet.
Dwight,I'm talking about... hmmm.
Toby,I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better.
Darryl,"Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby}"
Dwight,"So long Darryl, feel better... He's lying."
Toby,He has a doctor's note.
Dwight,"Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders."
Toby,A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news.
Dwight,Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? Y'all having birthday cake?
Toby,That's not a very good Darryl.
Dwight,Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
Toby,Hmmm.
Dwight,It just doesn't add up.
Toby,"Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel. I'll punch you in da mush, see."
Michael,"Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye."
Jim,Who was that?
Michael,Sorry about that. What'd I miss?
David,"Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind."
Michael,"Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting. Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes."
Creed,They've been in there a while.
Michael,Yeah.
Creed,Can't be good.
Michael,Nope.
Creed,Think they're talking about me?
Michael,"No, I think they're talking about me."
Creed,"Yeah, that makes way more sense. Okay thanks boss."
Michael,"What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here."
Pam,Hey Kelly.
Kelly,"Ugh, so jealous of your boobs."
Pam,"Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine."
Kelly,Is Ryan going?
Pam,"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet."
Pam,"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls. Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls. Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work."
Kelly,"Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim."
Andy,What can I do for ya Hoss?
Michael,How are your sales doin'?
Andy,"How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer."
Phyllis,Again with the cousin.
Andy,"Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. ""Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha."""
Michael,"Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?"
Michael,Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
Michael,"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant."
Michael,Be my eyes.
Andy,You got it.
Stanley,What have we here?
Andy,"Oh, just backing up and turning around."
Kevin,"Hey, we're gonna do this..."
Andy,"Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room."
David,Cheese platter?
Andy,"Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit."
David,"Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak."
Jim,"No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it."
David,Thank you Jim.
David,"Erin, is Michael around?"
Erin,I think he's around here...
Michael,"Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?"
David,"Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?"
Michael,"Yes, definitely."
Toby,Sounds like a EMDP-40.
Dwight,"Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched."
Toby,You're into trains?
Dwight,I have been my whole life.
Toby,Wow.
Dwight,I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Toby,That's so cool.
Dwight,Yeah.
Toby,"Wow, I'd love to take a look at that."
Dwight,"Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime."
Toby,"Well, you know, 'cause of the trains."
Dwight,"Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming."
Toby,"Uhh, oh boy, oh boy."
Dwight,"Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!"
Toby,Get over there! Get over there!
Dwight,"Oh, worker's comp, my ass!"
Toby,"I can't believe this. Hey you, ass****!"
Dwight,Toby...
Toby,You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
Dwight,Ooohhh... Oh man! You okay?
Toby,Just keep going.
Pam,Hey Ryan.
Ryan,Hey.
Pam,"So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding."
Ryan,"Yeah, I might stop by."
Pam,It costs about $75 per person.
Ryan,"Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77."
Pam,Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
Ryan,"Yes, I'm coming to your wedding."
Pam,"Okay, Ryan Howard, yes."
Ryan,"Probably, yes."
Pam,"Kelly Kapoor, yes."
David,Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
Michael,Look who you're talking to.
David,I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
Michael,"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever."
David,What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Michael,Permission to speak on the record?
David,Please do.
Michael,"Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe."
David,I thought you liked Jim?
Michael,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable."
David,"""Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is."""
Michael,"It's not very well written, but you get the gist."
David,Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
Michael,I can just continue to run it myself.
David,Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Michael,This was Jim's idea?
David,Mmhmm.
Michael,"Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block."
David,"Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him."
Jim,"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon."
David,Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
Jim,Sure.
Michael,I can't help but feel partially responsible.
Michael,Little pick me up? Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush.
Jim,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?"
Michael,Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
Jim,Why don't we head in your office to talk?
Michael,"Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said..."
Jim,"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed."
Michael,"Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy."
Jim,"Michael, did you say anything?"
Michael,"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion."
Jim,Really?
Michael,Yes!
Jim,You will? Wanna do it right now?
Michael,Yes.
Jim,I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
Dwight,I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.
Toby,If they were dilated...
Darryl,Toby! Dwight! Is that them?
Gwenneth,Definitely.
Darryl,"You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food."
Dwight,We thought that she was you.
Darryl,Why would you think a lady is me?
Dwight,Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
Toby,"No, nah. I don't see it."
Darryl,"Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you."
Dwight,"Aww, Darryl."
Darryl,C'mon Gwenneth.
Gwenneth,Sad.
David,This is David.
Michael,"Hey David, this is Michael Scott. Michael Scott here."
David,Yep.
Michael,Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
David,"So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?"
Michael ,"Absolutely, not. Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job."
David,"Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier."
Michael,"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him."
David,"Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file."
Michael,"Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs."
David,"Michael, I really don't know what's going on down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit."
Toby,"Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh..."
Darryl,Cool.
Dwight,Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
Toby,What?
Dwight,"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed."
Darryl,Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Dwight,Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.
Toby,"Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain..."
Darryl,"Alright, yeah fine so whatever..."
Dwight,Yes!
Toby,You really did it...
Dwight,"Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form."
Darryl,And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
Dwight,Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...
Toby,"Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives."
Toby,So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork. We worked it out.
Michael,"Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it."
Jim,How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
Michael,"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, and now I don't wanna lose the baby."
Jim,"So instead, you screwed me?"
Michael,That's what she...
Jim,No.
Erin,David Wallace is calling.
Michael,Kind of in the middle of something here.
Erin,Should I tell him you'll call him back?
Michael,"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both."
Michael,Hello.
David,"Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?"
Michael,"No, it's just us."
David,"Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please."
Michael,"Oh, oh, well here he is right now. Come in."
Jim,Hi David.
David,"Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board."
Michael,Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
David,We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
Jim,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool."
Michael,"I like that, so manager and co-manager."
David,"Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs."
Michael,Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
David,"Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do?"
Dwight,"Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed..."
Michael,"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?"
Dwight,Could you please sign my expense report?
Michael,I... will skip a turn.
Michael,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic."
Jim,"Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that."
Dwight,Sign this.
Michael,I need more time.
Jim,"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the ""please""? We're not animals."
Erin,Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.
Dwight,Sign it.
Dwight,"People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly."
Jim,"No, not without a ""please."""
Dwight,"Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces."
Dwight,Idiot.
Oscar,What the hell?!
Dwight,I have a complaint about Jim.
Dwight,Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Michael,That is not big picture.
Michael,"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?"
Dwight,"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office."
Kevin,What does a bean mean?
Michael,... Okay.
Pam,"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?"
Dwight,Jim won't sign my expense report.
Kevin,"Michael, what does a bean mean?"
Michael,That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
Pam,Jim?
Dwight,"No, that is huge."
Jim,I was just trying to be unbiased.
Michael,You're trying to trick me.
Kevin,What does a bean mean?!
Dwight,This has to do--
Oscar,Someone please explain it to Kevin.
Michael,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out."
Meredith,Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
Dwight,I'd like to lodge a complaint.
Phyllis,Not according to the beans.
Jim,I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Angela,This is how you make this important decision?
Dwight,You!
Andy,There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. That is ridiculous. This is how it works.
Jim,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
Phyllis,It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Dwight,One minute ago.
Andy,"Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise."
Jim,Okay. And how do you feel?
Phyllis,"Yeah, I would, too."
Dwight,Angry.
Dwight,"Are we idiots? What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!"
Jim,All right. Did he hit you?
Phyllis,I say no.
Dwight,No.
Dwight,"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? Okay."
Jim,Did you cry?
Michael,
Dwight,No.
Kevin,What does a bean mean?
Jim,Did you feel like crying?
Michael,How you doing?
Dwight,No.
Jim,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four."
Jim,"I'm just gonna write ""held back tears."""
Michael,"Oh, what are you usually?"
Dwight,"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true."
Jim,Six. You?
Jim,"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it."
Michael,"Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero."
Dwight,I'm not cr-- uhh!
Jim,"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?"
Dwight,"I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!"
Michael,"I know, I know."
Erin,"Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down."
Jim,We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
Michael,"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while."
Michael,"Yes, we did."
Jim,Michael...
Jim,I just-- what?
Michael,Yes?
Michael,"Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you."
Jim,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
Phyllis,Michael!
Michael,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?"
Kevin,Michael!
Stanley,Can I also be a boss?
Phyllis,Come on! This isn't fair!
Oscar,"Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?"
Jim,Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Jim,I have noticed that we--
Phyllis,"Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!"
Michael,Welcome.
Jim,Thank you.
Jim,Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
Michael,You're welcome.
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Jim,What's in here?
Jim,"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--"
Michael,Gin.
Michael,Disruptive.
Jim,Ooh!
Jim,Yes.
Michael,Just pretend we're not here.
Michael,"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important."
Ryan,Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
Jim,"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics."
Pam,"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you."
Michael,Let's do.
Ryan,"Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?"
Jim,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets."
Pam,$100 now for sure.
Michael,"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?"
Ryan,"Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift..."
Jim,I am.
Pam,"Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred."
Michael,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets..."
Ryan,"Instead of $5,000 a year from now?"
Jim,Right.
Pam,How sure is this?
Michael,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are."
Pam,The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
Jim,"Yes, I agree."
Pam,Don't tell Jim.
Michael,"Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust."
Jim,I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
Michael,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea."
Jim,You mean on a weekend?
Michael,Yes.
Jim,How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
Michael,Alright. No more meetings this week.
Jim,Really? You just agreed to that?
Michael,I can be very suprising.
Phyllis,What's going on?
Pam,"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant."
Ryan,"You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight."
Phyllis,"Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?"
Pam,"We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much."
Pam,"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?"
Phyllis,Perfect. I hate registries.
Pam,"Oh, good."
Phyllis,"My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?"
Pam,"No, we're not."
Phyllis,Good. Good.
Michael,Mm-hmm?
Jim,"Okay, I thought I saw people missing."
Michael,"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each."
Jim,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?"
Michael,"Stanley, you don't need to answer that."
Jim,Stanley?
Stanley,"""If you don't smell this, you're fired."""
Jim,"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these."
Michael,"What do you mean by ""these people""?"
Jim,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting."
Michael,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room."
Jim,That's not what I meant.
Michael,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want."
Jim,I disagree.
Michael,What do you guys think?
Jim,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?"
Michael,"No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people."
Jim,"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager."
Michael,That is not what Wallace told us.
Jim,That's exactly what Wallace told us.
Michael,That is not the way I heard it.
Kelly,"I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible."
Michael,"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around."
Jim,"I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace."
Michael,"No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. I will call David Wallace."
Erin,David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Michael,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
Jim,"Hey, David. You got Jim here."
Michael,"Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager."
David Wallace,"Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it."
Michael,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision."
Jim,Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
David Wallace,It's probably a little of both.
Michael,Which is it more of?
David Wallace,Excuse me?
Jim,"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work."
David Wallace,"Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?"
Michael,I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
David Wallace,"Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?"
Jim,"Nope, not at all."
Michael,"No, it will not be. I am on top of it."
David Wallace,Very good.
Jim,"Alright, thanks alot, David."
Michael,"Talk to you later-- Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. Alright, I am looking forward to this."
Jim,You don't have to lie.
Michael,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore."
Jim,Right.
Michael,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
Jim,Alright. Let's get started.
Creed,"Hey, why haven't we ever, um..."
Meredith,We have.
Michael,"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it."
Jim,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?"
Michael,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim."
Jim,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
Michael,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?"
Jim,It's hard to tell so far.
Michael,You use your brain too much.
Jim,"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?"
Michael,Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
Jim,You just came up with that.
Michael,As I was saying it.
Jim,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit."
Michael,Con-- you look like a nerd.
Jim,Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Michael,Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
Jim,Pro-- no favoritism.
Michael,"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there."
Jim,"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it."
Kevin,"Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where."
Pam,I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
Kevin,Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Kevin,Will you take a check?
Pam,Yeah.
Kevin,"Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, ""To love's eternal glory."""
Pam,Okay.
Kevin,Wait til' Monday.
Pam,"Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. oh look! ""Mrs. Pam Halpert!"" That's the first time I've seen it in writing!"
Jim,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen."
Michael,That will not go over well.
Jim,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us..."
Michael,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself."
Jim,I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
Michael,"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue."
Jim,Michael.
Michael,And then another--
Jim,"Look, you have a lot of strengths."
Michael,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are."
Jim,I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Michael,Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
Jim,But there is a reason why I'm here!
Michael,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
Jim,"No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!"
Michael,"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?"
Jim,I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
Michael,Ah.
Jim,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision."
Michael,"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!"
Jim,"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table."
Michael,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it."
Jim,
Michael,This had better be terrible.
Jim,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff."
Meredith,Wait. Seriously?!
Jim,"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults."
Oscar,"Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people."
Angela,"But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?"
Oscar,"Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with."
Jim,"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all."
Oscar,Well?
Jim,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office."
Kelly,What's going on?
Kevin,Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Kelly,What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
Oscar,"Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?"
Kelly,No! How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
Dwight,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
Jim,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--"
Dwight,"What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!"
Oscar,Exactly!
Kevin,Totally!
Oscar,We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Creed,Yes.
Angela,"Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!"
Meredith,My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
Kevin,Yeah.
Dwight,"Her kid needs shoes, Jim!"
Meredith,What the hell?!
Jim,"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so..."
Michael,"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you, and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--"
Angela,What are you talking about Michael?
Stanley,We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
Michael,My plan-- a man-- panama.
Andy,That's not how that goes.
Meredith,You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
Jim,"Thank you, Meredith."
Meredith,...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
Oscar,"We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?"
Michael,"Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do."
Oscar,"Again, that gives us no information."
Phyllis,"This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!"
Michael,What about a raise based on merit?
Jim,Rank each person individually?
Michael,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best."
Jim,"Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started."
Michael,Are you making a--
Jim,Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
Oscar,Just--
Kevin,"Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us."
Angela,It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
Meredith,I am so pissed at this company!
Dwight,And Jim!
Meredith,Yeah. Who said that?
Dwight,I think it was Creed.
Creed,Yep.
Jim,"It's going really well, actually."
Jim,"Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that?"
Michael,Toby.
Jim,He's not a part of this. You know that.
Michael,Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
Jim,"Okay, your move."
Michael,Alright! Who to pick? Who to pick?
Jim,Here we go.
Pam,"I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?"
Michael,When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
Angela,Yes.
Jim,We would really appreciate it.
Pam,Michael.
Oscar,What are you doing?
Dwight,Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
Michael,...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
Kevin,I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Pam,"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy."
Pam,Michael. Stop.
Oscar,How long do you take to pee?
Phyllis,Now this is getting ridiculous.
Michael,"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word."
Kevin,"The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on."
Dwight,"Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk."
Jim,Alright.
Michael,Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--
Meredith,All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
Michael,Jim.
Pam's mom,"Oh, yeah--"
Pam,I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
Jim,To waiting.
Michael,Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
Andy,"[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite"
Everyone,To waiting.
Pam's mom,No.
Michael,What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
Mema,"I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called ""Bruno"" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know."
Michael,Oh... okay. Were you saving it?
Jim,It is really special.
Pam,Mema.
Pam's mom,"Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I was just--I've had a very rough weekend."
Pam,"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great."
Michael,I'm sorry. Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.
Michael,It's just a really important day for me.
Erin,Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Jim,"Well, congrats."
Angela,Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
Michael,Thanks.
Michael,That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
Michael,my weekend was bad so far.
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day."
Jim,I can't believe it was me.
Pam's mom,Oh--
Jim,"Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column."
Michael,"I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me."
Michael,"I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm."
Kevin,"So... you're going to provide them, then?"
Jim,Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
Pam's mom,Oh that sounds awful.
Jim,No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Michael,I have not found that to be the case.
Michael,And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
Kevin,What the hell?
Pam,"Hey, smooth guys."
Pam's mom,Oh--
Dwight,Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
Jim,I'm so sorry.
Michael,It is a terrible year for love.
Pam,Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Michael,"Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me."
Pam's mom,Yeah. Guess it is.
Jim,Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
Pam,Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
Michael,I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
Angela,Decent people everywhere will get offended.
Jim,"Oh, my God. Are you serious?"
Tom Halpert,"Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?"
Pam,"Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned."
Michael,There's gonna be a free room?
Michel,"Um, yeah."
Angela,"Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers."
Michael,"Hi, Mema. It's Michael."
Tom,Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.
Jim,That's nice.
Mema,Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.
Pete Halpert,Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.
Pam,"You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding."
Michael,Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
Michael,"Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. There you go. Use it in good health."
Angela,"Really, Pam..."
Michael,"I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody."
Tom and Pete,Yes!
Michael,Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time.
Mema,I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off.
Meredith,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?"
Angela,Ow! He pinched me!
Michael,"Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there."
Stanley,Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Michael,No.
Mema,Oh. Thank you.
Kevin,"Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?"
Pam,Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
Michael,You're welcome.
Stanley,No.
Dwight,We'll see.
Mema,It was that horrible Charlie Rose.
Kevin,Who would want it?
Pam,"Thank you, Dwight."
Michael,"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have s*x before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have s*x and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life."
Oscar,"Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes."
Jim,Good-bye.
Mema,People are like cats and dogs these days.
Dwight,Toby.
Pam,See you later.
Michael,Exactly.
Toby,What?
Michael,"And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara."
Mema,This used to be such a great country.
Dwight,I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Andy,"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara."
Michael,I know.
Toby,
Michael,Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
Mema,I don't know what happened to it.
Dwight,Crap. Come here you.
Andy,No... I didn't steal your joke.
Michael,"They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema."
Toby,Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them.
Michael,Yes. I said that yesterday.
Mema,"You mean, Sylvia."
Pam's dad,Hey. What happened?
Dwight,But you can say that about anything.
Michael,"Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio."
Ryan,Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Michael,Dwight...
Andy,Partay. Room 639.
Jim,"Well we are here now, so let's just--"
Dwight,"What happens in accounting, stays in accounting."
Kevin,Yes!
Michael,Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?
Kevin,Oh yeah.
Andy,"Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models."
Jim,You look great.
Michael,"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke."
Kevin,That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
Pam,You look great.
Dwight,It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
Andy,Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
Tom,Wear a tie much?
Michael,"This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!"
Andy,No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
Penny,I begged them not to.
Michael,Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
Andy,"If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come."
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
Angela,And where do you think you're going?
Penny,I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.
Michael,Get out of here.
Pam,I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
Pam,Yes I did.
Dwight,Yes.
Angela,"Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?"
Penny,I'm sorry.
Michael,"Oh, my God, Dwight."
Pam,I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Pam,Go ahead. I think it's your turn.
Dwight,"For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster."
Angela,Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
Penny,"Wait, what happened? You're okay with this?"
Michael,There's... a name.
Pam,Nevermind.
Pam,"Yeah, I'm okay."
Dwight,Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Angela,Are you sure?
Penny,Okay then!
Michael,"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn."
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,"Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube."
Dwight,Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Angela,It'll be fun.
Pam,Saw it.
Micheal,Ok.
Pam,No.
Jim,"I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her."
Dwight,"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike."
Michael,What are you wearing?
Kevin,"What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking. Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel."
Michael,Is that all you have on her?
Dwight,"What? It's a casual, social outfit."
Dwight,"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name."
Michael,"Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight."
Michael,You're an idiot.
Dwight,No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during s*x.
Kevin,"People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. It's the hair-- Ok. Ok. I'm going. God."
Michael,"Ok. That's not appropriate. Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go."
Andy,"Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know."
Kevin,It's a good idea.
Kelly,This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
Oscar,It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
Andy,Mmm-hmm. Erin?
Kevin,"Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice."
Erin,Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Dwight,"I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself."
Andy,Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
Michael,"Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm."
Pam,"Hey, my aunt told me something neat."
Isabel,Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have?
Jim,Yeah?
Dwight,Nine and three-quarters.
Pam,She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
Dwight,"I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'."
Jim,"Oh, wow. That's cool."
Michael,"Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar."
Pam,Yeah.
Dwight,Michael.
Jim,"Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever."
Michael,Yes.
Pam,Oh.
Dwight,Drop this one. Abort.
Jim,Lousy Picture.
Michael,Why?
Pam,We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Dwight,I found twins.
Michael,Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Michael,"Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you."
Dwight,What? No way!
Dwight,Aren't they magnificent?
Michael,Those glasses are super dark.
Michael,"They're men, Dwight."
Dwight,Oh. God.
Dwight,I love finding a good set of twins.
Michael,"Alright. We need some tunes, I think."
Michael,Something is wrong with you.
Dwight,You know what? I made you a cd...
Erin,Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Michael,You did?
Andy,"You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this."
Dwight,Mmm-hmm.
Kelly,"Lame! What else you got, Andy?"
Michael,That was nice of you.
Andy,How about a little bit of this.
Dwight,This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Erin,Oh yeah. What else you got?
Michael,"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in."
Kevin,What else you got?
Dwight,"You're gonna like this. ""Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--"""
Andy,Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!
Michael,Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
Erin,What else you got?
Dwight,Yeah. It's practical.
Kevin,It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. Pam?
Michael,No. No. That's not how it works.
Andy,I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
Jim,"Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun."
Pam,What?
Front Desk Clerk,Halpert...
Andy,I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
Jim,And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
Pam,"Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours."
Front Desk Clerk,Great.
Andy,Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.
Jim,"I know. We're pretty excited, too."
Pam,"Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?"
Pam,Can we take a look at the suite now?
Jim,What?
Front Desk Clerk,"Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in."
Pam,He tore his scrotum dancing.
Pam,Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Jim,What?
Front Desk Clerk,"Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there."
Pam,He is in my room icing his balls.
Andy,Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed.
Jim,What?
Jim,I don't like that.
Pam,Please stop saying what. Can you take him?
Pam,"I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please."
Jim,"Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted."
Michael,Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
Pam,Your brothers took you out drinking?
Front Desk Clerk,One moment while I check.
Jim,Uh...
Dwight,The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Michael,"Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly."
Michael,Mmm-hmm.
Pam,That's Michael. You're out with Michael?
Front Desk Clerk,"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?"
Jim,And Dwight.
Michael,I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
Dwight,Hey-O!
Front Desk Clerk,"Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out."
Jim,"Pam, it just happened."
Dwight,Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number
Pam,"Okay, fine. I'll take him."
Front Desk Clerk,Yes. Schrute.
Jim,"I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!"
Dwight,And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Michael,I love you!
Front Desk Clerk,Sure. No problem.
Pam,Are you pushing me off the phone?
Dwight,Ok.
Jim,No. Let's talk for a long time.
Front Desk Clerk,"Here's your key, Mr. Schrute."
Pam,Goodbye.
Michael,"Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room."
Michael,Mmm! It's after midnight.
Dwight,No way. What if I meet someone?
Michael and Dwight,You're married. He's married!
Michael,"I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight."
Dwight,Congratulations.
Dwight,No. No.
Jim,That's not how that works.
Michael,I would do the same for you.
Dwight,Oh my goodness.
Dwight,You would?
Michael,Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,You'll have Pam to answer to.
Dwight,Really?
Michael,"She'll be sitting home saying, ""Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."" ""And... and clip my toenails."""
Michael,Yes... just go--
Dwight,"""Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."""
Dwight,"Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours."
Michael,Now you sound like Kermit.
Michael,Oh. Thank God.
Andy,Are you sure this is the right way?
Dwight,"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?"
Pam,"Nope. I, like you, have never been here before."
Michael,Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
Andy,"Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum."
Dwight,Please?
Pam,"Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before."
Michael,"If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay."
Andy,I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--
Dwight,Mmm-hmm.
Pam,My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job.
Michael,Ok.
Andy,"Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--"
Dwight,Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Andy,"Ow, ow!"
Michael,I don't have a room?
Andy,I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
Dwight,No you do not.
Pam,"Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?"
Michael,Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Andy,No. No that was real.
Dwight,It worked.
Michael,Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?
Michael,Jerk.
Hotel Employee,Good morning. How can I help you?
Michael,"When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet."
Kevin,"I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet."
Stanley,Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
Hotel Employee,You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please.
Michael,Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
Kevin,Thank you.
Stanley,Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
Hotel Employee,Sir. It's the man with the shoes.
Michael,Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
Hotel Manager,Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone.
Stanley,I got one queen size bed.
Kevin,They were stolen?
Michael,You... are... kidding me.
Hotel Manager,No. Destroyed.
Stanley,"A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael."
Kevin,What?
Michael,"I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?"
Hotel Manager,The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually.
Erin,Oh. Gross.
Kevin,But that was my only pair of shoes.
Kelly,Blow my brains out.
Hotel Manager,"It became a safety issue, sir."
Michael,That's rude.
Kevin,Well... well damn-it.
Toby,"Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want."
Hotel Employee,I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
Michael,"You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it."
Kevin,Okay.
Mr. Halpert,"So, which one is Pam's grandma?"
Dwight,You have everything?
Pam,"Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles."
Isabel,Hmm-hmm.
Jim,"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?"
Dwight,Cell phone? Charger?
Mr. Halpert,No.
Isabel,Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day.
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word."
Dwight,"It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel."
Jim,"Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott."
Isabel,"That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding?"
Mr. Halpert,Oh.
Dwight,You know it.
Michael,How ya doin'?
Isabel,K.
Mr. Halpert,Hi.
Dwight,"Okay, get out of here."
Michael,Nice to meet you.
Isabel,Bye.
Mr. Halpert,Nice to meet you.
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
Michael,"Hey, good morning. It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit."
Jim,"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think."
Dwight,Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.
Michael,That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
Michael,How can you eat like that?
Jim,Pretty sure everyone heard that.
Dwight,I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?
Michael,Didn't move my lips.
Michael,"Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself."
Pam,"Hey, Mema."
Dwight,"Hey, what was she like?"
Mema,I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you.
Michael,She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.
Pam,Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
Dwight,Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?
Mema,Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that.
Michael,She was from Europe.
Jim,Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
Dwight,No kidding.
Mr. Beesly,I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly.
Michael,Uh-huh.
Jim,"Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?"
Dwight,I bet she had hairy armpits.
Mr. Beesly,No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?
Michael,No.
Dwight,"From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report."
Dwight,"Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere."
Little Girl,Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter?
Michael,Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
Dwight,"Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt."
Dwight,No.
Kids,Ewwww!
Michael,She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
Dwight,That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Dwight,Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.
Pam,"Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor."
Michael,No... you're crazy.
Oscar,Pleased to meet you.
Dwight,Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.
Penny,"I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil?"
Michael,She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--
Kevin,She thought I was your boyfriend.
Dwight,You should ask her out.
Oscar,You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
Michael,I already have my European girlfriend.
Pam,"Oscar, it was an honest mistake."
Stanley,If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Oscar,Him? Him?
Phyllis,That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.
Kevin,"Oscar, I would be proud to date you."
Angela,Oh my God.
Penny,I'm sorry.
Oscar,Oh...
Kevin,I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
Kevin,Oscar. Angela.
Penny,"Nice to meet you, Kevin."
Erin,Are you in a lot of pain?
Kevin,Yes.
Andy,Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.
Oscar,You owe me and apology.
Erin,People say you cry all the time.
Penny,I'm so sorry.
Andy,Well that's not--
Kevin,Are you seeing anyone right now?
Meredith,Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me.
Pam,She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
Andy,I wasn't telling you.
Kevin,Cool.
Meredith,Is there still something there?
Ryan,I was the youngest VP in the company history.
Andy,Excuse me?
Meredith,"More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories."
Meredith,It didn't get torn off?
Ryan,Um... also--
Andy,"No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that?"
Andy,How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
Jim,I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.
Kevin,She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Erin,If you want to sit on this-- I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged pen1s. Make it softer.
Andy,What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
Andy,"It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you."
Isabel,"Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here."
Michael,"Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me."
Michael,"Head table, where I belong."
Dwight,"I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs."
Dwight,It's just for family.
Penny,Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby.
Michael,"Well, who's that one?"
Pam,Thank you weirdo.
Dwight,"Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2."
Pam's mom,everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom.
Michael,"What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?"
Pam,"Okay, here I come."
Dwight,That's a very good record.
Pam's mom,Oh darling! You look beautiful.
Pete,"Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'."
Pam,Thanks mom.
Tom,"That's when I'll do the face, like-"
Pam's mom,"Oh, I hope he deserves you."
Pete,"Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--"
Pam,He does.
Tom,A noogie?
Pam's mom,Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't.
Pete,You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
Penny,"Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag."
Michael,"They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom."
Pam,"Yes. Thank you, mom."
Tom,"Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine."
Isabel,"Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight."
Pete,Smoking.
Pam,"Okay great. Yeah, I'll see you in a second. Wait, what? Oh! Oh no!"
Tom,Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch.
Jim,Hey!
Pete,A little mo' cardio.
Pam,Can you come here please?
Michael,"That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider."
Jim,Is this allowed?
Dwight,Knight Rider.
Pam,"No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here."
Michael,That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
Dwight,That was an intelligent comment.
Dwight,No.
Isabel,Hello stranger. How do I look?
Michael,"That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."
Dwight,"Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?"
Dwight,Very smart.
Isabel,Um... nothing. Anymore.
Michael,And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
Dwight,"So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement."
Jim,No.
Michael,"Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?"
Michael,Yeah. Go ahead.
Isabel,I'm standing. I'm a bridesmaid.
Jim,"Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming."
Michael,"Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?"
Pete,Douche.
Pam,Hey.
Jim,"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?"
Jim,Wow. You look--
Pam,Like... a year.
Pam,Terrible.
Jim,"I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--"
Jim,So beautiful. Hey--
Mema,What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?
Pam,My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Jim,"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant."
Jim,"Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty."
Michael,"Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--"
Pam,Thank you.
Mema,They were living together?
Jim,"And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?"
Michael,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation."
Pam,"No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--"
Jim,Michael.
Jim,There. Now we're even.
Michael,"When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation."
Pam,Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum. And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend. This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?
Jim,"Oh, my God. Please."
Phyllis,I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.
Michael,"The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. ""Mental"" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it."
Michael,Okay.
Toby,"Well the ""fun"" is in it."
Dwight,"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?"
Michael,Get out.
Michael,It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
Toby,"Yeah, I know."
Andy,"You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you."
Michael,"Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need ""small talk."" What topics can you use for small talk?"
Michael,I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
Andy,Golf.
Dwight,"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour."
Michael,Mmhm.
Michael,It was a lot of snap decisions.
Andy,Stock market.
Dwight,"Do you know what ""snap decision"" means?"
Michael,Mmhm.
Michael,Yes!
Andy,Dave Matthews.
Dwight,It means like this.
Michael,"Yes, what else?"
Michael,Just get in the car.
Creed,"Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes..."
Jim,Hello?
Michael,No.
Michael,Jim?
Meredith,The weekend!
Jim,Michael?
Michael,"Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, ""So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"""
Michael,Oh thank God.
Meredith,Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Jim,"How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran."
Michael,All right...
Michael,"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier."
Meredith,He calls it an upper decker.
Jim,That sounds bad.
Michael,"Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with."
Michael,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend."
Ryan,Then do it.
Jim,I'm gonna help you through it all right?
Michael,What?
Michael,Okay!
Ryan,Write a book.
Jim,All you're gonna need to and- it- and then go to--
Michael,"The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman..."
Michael,Jim? Are you?
Erin,"Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to."
Jim,And then you'll be saved.
Michael,"Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?"
Michael,"What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said."
Erin,"In your schedule it just says nine til noon is ""creative space"" and I thought this could be part of that."
Jim,Just and then you'll be saved.
Michael,Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
Michael,"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!"
Erin,"You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says ""free play."""
Jim,A- ah--
Michael,Push free play til tomorrow morning. Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
Michael,No! Oh my God!
Grotti,Ah.
Jim,And you'll be saved.
Michael,Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
Michael,"No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!"
Grotti,"As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride."
Jim,I at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.
Michael,Mmhm.
Michael,Jim?!? Oh my God.
Grotti,But you also got a lot of responsibility
Michael,"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?"
Michael,Yep.
Oscar,"Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it."
Grotti,"None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss."
Michael,Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
Michael,Okay.
Oscar,Just- no. No.
Michael,"There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player."
Michael,"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks."
Kevin,Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Dwight,"We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault."
Andy,What do you think?
Andy,He's alive. So you're welcome.
Dwight,I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
Dwight,"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job."
Grotti,God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse.
Andy,"Yeah, some of that existed before."
Michael,"Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up."
Dwight,"Not the living in fear, that's new."
Grotti,"Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury."
Andy,"You're right, that is new."
Michael,"Mmhm, I hear you. The truck."
Dwight,Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Grotti,You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.
Andy,Well I don't see that happening.
Michael,"Okay, well."
Dwight,Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
Grotti,I can be very very persistent.
Andy,Are you saying-
Michael,Do your worst.
Dwight,Yeah...
Michael,"Oh, great."
Andy,That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
Grotti,"Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?"
Dwight,What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Michael,Mmhm.
Andy,That seems a little far-fetched.
Andy,What happened in there?
Dwight,Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.
Michael,"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman."
Dwight,Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Dwight,Did he threaten you?
Michael,No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
Michael,"No Dwight, not everything is a threat."
Andy,"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean."
Andy,Mobsters are!
Dwight,"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really."
Michael,There is no such things as monsters.
Andy,Class act. Boy scout.
Andy,He drives an SUV!
Michael,But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
Dwight,"I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space."
Andy,He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
Oscar,"Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?"
Dwight,And he made us all look like chumps!
Dwight,"No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster."
Michael,
Michael,"Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance."
Michael,"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden."
Andy,"All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation."
Grotti,This is Grotti.
Oscar,"For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia."
Michael,This is Scott.
Michael,"I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance."
Grotti,"Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now."
Andy,"Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!"
Michael,Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
Dwight,Exactly.
Grotti,"I, I thought you'd be pleased."
Michael,He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
Michael,Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
Oscar,"Uhh. All right, who else is here?"
Grotti,What?
Oscar,"Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between ""sane and others."" Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The ""coalition for reason"" is extremely weak."
Michael,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance."
Toby,Oscar says I checked out huh? Huh.
Grotti,I don't get it. How was I scaring you?
Michael,"Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?"
Michael,I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
Ryan,"Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'"
Andy,Whoa. Okay.
Michael,Okay.
Michael,You suck!
Ryan,What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Dwight,Okay that's-
Michael,"Um it is, Grotti."
Michael,And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
Andy and Dwight,Oh no. Fabulous.
Dwight,"That's good, let's wrap it up."
Oscar,What? What?
Michael,"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?"
Andy,"It's John Gotti, you idiot!"
Grotti,"Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?"
Oscar,"It's, it's a completely different name!"
Michael,Doubt it.
Phyllis,So he won't get caught!
Dwight and Andy,Oh man.
Andy,Yeah. It's pretty close.
Michael,What a tool. What?
Oscar,"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it."
Andy,"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!"
Dwight,"No I disagree. ""R"" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it ""murder."" And not ""muck-duck."""
Michael,No. What do you mean?
Michael,Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
Dwight,"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared."
Dwight,Lock your door!
Michael,What?
Michael,I'm not gonna lock my door.
Dwight,You successfully backed down the mob!
Jim,Hello?
Andy,You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
Oscar,Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
Michael,Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
Jim,"Oscar! Uh, what is going on?"
Michael,"So I looked him in the eye and I said, ""Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead."" I said something like that."
Oscar,"It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this."
Dwight,Very close.
Jim,"Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-"
Oscar,"Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg."
Pam,Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
Michael,Erin?
Oscar,"Pam, I'm sorry--"
Erin,Yes?
Pam,"Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us."
Michael,Coffee?
Oscar,"You're right. You're right. Oh, okay bye."
Erin,Okay.
Michael,It's Grotti. He's following up.
Michael,"Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back."
Andy,"Already? This, this guy is persistent!"
Erin,Okay.
Michael,"""I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."""
Michael,Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
Dwight,That's bad.
Erin,How do you return coffee?
Michael,Yeah.
Michael,Go. Any questions?
Dwight,That's bad.
Pam,Are you kidding me?
Michael,"Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?"
Kevin,"Hi Pam, is Jim there?"
Andy,Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
Pam,"Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!"
Michael,"Okay, I'm calling the police."
Kevin,"Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi."
Andy,That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
Pam,Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
Dwight,He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
Kevin,Cool. Okay. Bye.
Michael,All right.
Kevin,They have no idea what happened.
Andy,"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!"
Michael,Shh!
Dwight,You know what?
Michael,That's not gonna happen.
Dwight,That's an exaggeration.
Andy,That's how it works!
Michael,What am I supposed to do here?
Andy,"When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back"
Michael,I was thinking exactly the same thing.
Dwight,"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat."
Andy,Dwight...
Dwight,"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people."
Michael,"I don't know, I don't know about that."
Andy,"Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting."
Dwight,"Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent."
Andy,Okay.
Dwight,Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Andy,I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
Michael,"Hold on, hold on! Just-"
Andy,"No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way."
Michael,"All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone."
Andy,Well you're gonna have to. Dwight
Andy,What?
Michael,What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
Andy,"Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing."
Dwight,Do you know how to use it?
Andy,"To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it."
Michael,"Let's go, come on. God!"
Andy,Should I change?
Dwight,You're wearing loafers!
Michael,Forget it! Forget it!
Michael,Take that thing off the table! Please!
Andy,Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
Dwight,Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
Andy,Oh! God!
Michael,Oh my God!
Dwight,You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Michael,"Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is."
Michael,Hello.
Grotti,Mr. Scott.
Michael,Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
Grotti,Hi. Angelo Grotti.
Andy,Hi.
Dwight,Hello.
Grotti,"So, you got this table?"
Michael,Yes.
Grotti,"This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing."
Michael,Well.
Grotti,"Waitress, we're gonna sit over here."
Waitress,That's fine.
Michael,Okay.
Kevin,Hello.
Credit card rep,Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card.
Kevin,"Oh man, do you think it was stolen?"
Rep,First would you mind verifying your home address?
Kevin,"Um, yes. Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA"
Rep,And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number?
Kevin,Six-six-five-zero.
Rep,Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico.
Kevin,Wait a minute. Yes I am.
Rep,I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.
Kevin,"No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer."
Rep,Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away.
Kevin,No-
Rep,"Have a nice day, and thank you!"
Kevin,Shoot.
Grotti,"If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy."
Dwight,Oh he's not that nice.
Michael,That's not true.
Andy,Hmm. Very true.
Michael,Okay shut up.
Waitress,Have you decided?
Grotti,"Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back."
Waitress,Okay then. And for you sir?
Michael,I will have the gabba-gool.
Waitress,The... what?
Michael,The gabba-gool.
Waitress,I don't really know what that is.
Andy,"You know, gabba-gool."
Michael,"I don't, I don't have to have that."
Dwight,"What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool."
Michael,"Guys, guys-"
Waitress,I don't really think that we have that.
Michael,That's okay.
Dwight,Bring him the gabba-gool!
Michael,"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad."
Waitress,Okay.
Michael,"If the salad is on top, I send it back."
Oscar,Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
Kevin,"I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone."
Oscar,This constitutes identity fraud.
Kevin,Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
Oscar,What's that supposed to mean?
Kevin,Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.
Oscar,Why would I love jail?
Kevin,Because... You would love it.
Michael,I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
Grotti,Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.
Andy,Maybe we have a plan for you?
Grotti,"How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and Think about it."
Woman,Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?
Andy,Yeeeeah.
Woman,"My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help?"
Andy,Yes I can.
Michael,"No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad."
Grotti,Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go!
Andy,Okay!
Woman,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it."
Michael,"Hey, do you need any help?"
Grotti,"I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down."
Michael,He's a good mechanic.
Grotti,Where were we?
Michael,I don't...
Dwight,He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Michael,"Okay, okay okay."
Dwight,So we're choosing...
Michael,"Yep, all right."
Dwight,Check out Dental?
Michael,Put it down.
Andy,"Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down."
Kid,He seems bad at this.
Andy,You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube.
Woman,What?!?
Andy,"So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles."
Grotti,"Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. You okay, Pat?"
Andy,"Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of."
Grotti,Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?
Andy,"It was before, my tech- my technical training."
Dwight,Don't do it!
Andy,Do it.
Dwight,Don't.
Andy,Just do it.
Michael,Okay.
Grotti,"Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?"
Dwight,Yes.
Erin,They're back!
Michael,"Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry."
Kevin,Oooh yeah... Jim and Pam!
Toby,"Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it."
Kelly,How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
Michael,Can I sit down for a second?
Jim,It was.
Toby,"Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder."
Pam,It really was.
Michael,"This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation."
Jim,Really was.
Toby,"Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place."
Kelly,I'm so happy for you...
Michael,She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
Jim,Puerto Rico was awesome.
Toby,"Ok, I mean, I could talk to her."
Pam,"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot."
Michael,Really? Would you do that?
Jim,Frank and Beans. Always makes her laugh.
Toby,Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.
Pam,Frank and beans!
Michael,"You're a good, good guy."
Michael,"Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?"
Toby,I'm good...
Dwight,Yeah!
Toby,"You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends."
Michael,Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
Toby,"Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?"
Dwight,"Its Jim and Pam, Michael."
Pam,"Sure, what's up?"
Michael,It is?
Toby,"Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution."
Dwight,Yeah...
Pam,"What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?"
Michael,"They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!"
Michael,No... that's...
Jim,Nope.
Toby,Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
Michael,"And oh, Jim..."
Pam,"Oh, would that make you feel better?"
Pam,"Hi, Michael."
Michael,I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
Michael,"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy."
Pam,You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
Michael,Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
Toby,"Buddy, I think that..."
Meredith,So what'd you bring us?
Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass. Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it."
Pam,Some candy.
Stanley,"Heh, heh, heh."
Meredith,What else?
Pam,"Michael, you're just her rebound!"
Pam,That's it.
Michael,"You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her."
Meredith,"Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding."
Pam,What! You knew?
Michael,
Jim,"Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean..."
Pam,It's good to be home.
Michael,"Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will."
Dwight,This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Pam,"Mmmmm, yes!"
Jim,Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Michael,"Well, that is not gonna happen!"
Dwight,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... con-quack-ulations!"
Pam,Then why'd you even offer!?
Jim,"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you."
Michael,Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
Dwight,You're welcome!
Pam,"Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!"
Dwight,"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing."
Michael,You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
Dwight,I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
Pam,What's that supposed to mean?
Jim,It's a real handsome duck.
Michael,You know what it means.
Dwight,"Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair."
Jim,Hey...
Pam,Hey!
Pam,Shut it!
Erin,Hi!
Jim,Yep...
Pam,"Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy."
Michael,"I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week."
Erin,Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
Jim,"Dwight, you brought the mallard back."
Pam,Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
Dwight,"Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even..."
Erin,"Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first."
Jim,Hi buddy.
Pam,I think it'll be okay.
Dwight,I'm sorry.
Erin,"I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though."
Jim,A wooden duck?
Pam,Great.
Dwight,Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
Erin,"Oops, sorry. Oops."
Jim,"Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage..."
Michael,I have recently taken a lover.
Dwight,"Oh, I'm equipped... I can..."
Jim,"Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?"
Jim,Silence.
Michael,Pam's mom.
Dwight,Don't tell Michael...
Jim,What?
Jim,"I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car."
Michael,"Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?"
Dwight,"Punishment fits the crime, I accept."
Jim,You're messing with me.
Michael,"Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum."
Michael,About what?
Erin,Night Michael.
Jim,You did not have s*x with Pam's mom.
Michael,Night Erin.
Michael,"Oh, big time."
Jim,"Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car."
Jim,What kind of car does she drive?
Pam,"Awww, he did that for me?"
Michael,She drives a green camry.
Jim,"Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay."
Jim,
Pam,Mmmm.
Michael,And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Jim,Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
Jim,Oh my God. Oh my God.
Pam,"Haha, yeah. Say more nice things."
Michael,What?
Jim,"Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!"
Jim,"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-"
Pam,Maybe I'm overreacting.
Michael,"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?"
Jim,Yeah... maybe.
Jim,Oh my God.
Pam,But I don't think I am.
Toby,"Hey, Jim."
Jim,"You're not, nope. Nope."
Jim,"Not now, Toby, my God!"
Kevin,Oh... where'd you get that hat?
Toby,"Oh, Jesus!"
Ryan,I'd rather not say.
Michael,"Get the hell out of here, idiot."
Dwight,"""We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..."" I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane. ""...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."""
Toby,What did I do?
Jim,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again."
Michael,"I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy."
Jim,"No, not more than anything."
Michael,"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-"
Jim,"Don't call her ""the mom."""
Michael,She's right on my way home from work.
Jim,"Then take a different way home, man!"
Michael,"I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam."
Jim,"Okay, so we're good."
Michael,Yeah.
Michael,Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
Erin,"Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?"
Michael,Sure. Thanks for asking.
Erin,"Pam, we're all set. Yum."
Jim,Frank and beans!
Pam,"Frank and beans! So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?"
Jim,You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Pam,"Bottle of rum it is. Alright, shall we?"
Jim,"You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy."
Pam,"Come on, it'll take two seconds."
Jim,"No, it-"
Michael,"Oh, wow."
Pam,
Michael,That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
Erin,"Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people."
Michael,"Erin, look."
Erin,Fun!
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,"Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion."
Michael,"Yeah, no, it's nobody."
Pam,I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
Michael,Hmm... no.
Pam,I think you have a date.
Michael,I don't.
Pam,Come on.
Jim,"Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it."
Michael,"I don't deserve this, guys."
Jim,"Yes, you do."
Michael,"No, I don't."
Jim,Just take the parrot.
Michael,
Jim,"Okay, back to the old grind."
Michael,I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
Pam,"Oh, that's too bad."
Jim,Don't-
Michael,"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here."
Jim,Sounds complicated.
Michael,It is.
Pam,"Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes."
Michael,You want me to be happy?
Pam,Of course.
Michael,"Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine."
Pam,Oh.
Michael,"More than a friend, a co-worker."
Pam,"Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?"
Michael,It's okay.
Pam,"No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!"
Michael,"That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset."
Pam,
Dwight,"You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?"
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,"There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down..."
Michael,Feels good.
Dwight,There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
Michael,"I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner."
Dwight,"...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine."
Pam,"How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!"
Jim,Who wants a hot chocolate?
Pam,Thank you.
Jim,"Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure."
Pam,You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
Jim,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?"
Andy,"Sure thing, Tuna Boss."
Jim,
Andy,How may I be of service to you?
Jim,"I am gonna need your advice I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?"
Andy,This aurea is a joke.
Jim,Really?
Andy,What are you thinking?
Jim,I was gonna go with this one.
Andy,"Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better."
Dwight,The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
Andy,"I know, right?"
Dwight,What were you talking about in there?
Andy,Trust me it would only make you mad.
Michael,"Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities."
Andy,Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
Michael,"That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own."
Pam,Haha! Ha ha ha.
Jim,And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.
Michael,"Who wants to help the world one step at a time? Alright, good."
Dwight,Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
Michael,"Alright, that's..."
Meredith,Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
Michael,Alright...
Pam,"I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it."
Michael,"Okay, I'm out of here, see you later guys..."
Various,"Get out and stay out, bye..."
Michael,"Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation..."
Pam,"I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings. No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings!"
Michael,Anybody else? Who else has an idea?
Angela,I have some ideas about conservation...
Jim,Yes! Angela! Please...
Michael,Can you hold down the fort? Hey boo!
Angela,Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
Michael,What's it... why are you crying?
Jim,Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder...
Kevin,Shhhh...
Angela,"Well, for our profit..."
Kevin,Shhh...
Michael,"No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle."
Kevin,Who's pickle?
Michael,"Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now."
Angela,"I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor."
Jim,Yes.
Oscar,"Hold on, hold on, what's going on?"
Jim,Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
Pam,I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology.
Michael,For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
Pam,Don't call my mother your lover.
Kevin,Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
Andy,That is not okay dude.
Michael,"Alright, in my defense..."
Phyllis,Disgusting...
Creed,She's messed up man...
Pam,"Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!"
Oscar,You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Michael,"Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness."
Phyllis,"Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for."
Oscar,"Maybe you're right, who are we to..."
Pam,"Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!"
Dwight,I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Michael,Let's get back to the matter at hand.
Pam,"Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom..."
Michael,"No, no, no... no, no..."
Ryan,"Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about..."
Michael,"I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it."
Pam,"Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!"
Michael,"Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out."
Pam,"You are never going to be my father, you get out!"
Michael,"I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am..."
Pam,Me too...
Pam,Hey.
Oscar,Hey.
Angela,"Pam, how's your day going?"
Oscar,"Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions."
Pam,"Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?"
Oscar,My mother's in a wheelchair.
Pam,"Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page."
Kelly,"Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora?"
Ryan,"Ahh, I don't think so, no..."
Kelly,"Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora?"
Ryan,I'd rather not say.
Kelly,I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
Erin,Hi Dwight!
Dwight,Shh!
Ryan,...it should go with the persona you already have.
Kelly,"Well, I think I have that persona."
Dwight,Where did you get that mallard?
Kelly,What the hell is a mallard?
Dwight,That!
Kelly,"Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me."
Dwight,"Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back."
Kelly,"If you take it back, I'll scream."
Dwight,I'll give you five bucks for it.
Ryan,Twenty.
Dwight,Ten.
Ryan,Deal.
Kelly,You're so cool.
Ryan,"This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas."
Michael,"Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?"
Toby,"Yeah, sure, what's up?"
Michael,Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
Pam,"Yeah, I guess."
Kids,YAY!
Andy,"We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it."
Michael,Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha... ... ha ha ha.
Pam,"If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss."
Jim,"We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company."
Andy,You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
Michael,I am going to scare these kids so bad.
Pam,Yeah. Way too much.
Darryl,"This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim."
Andy,Yeah.
Angela,Black widow.
Pam,"I mean, what the hell was that?"
Kelly,Lulu from The Fifth Element.
Andy,What the heck was that?
Darryl,"Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get."
Pam,When you cried?
Creed,I want to sell your blood!
Andy,"Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy."
Ryan,That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
Pam,You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
Darryl,Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
Andy,"No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?"
Meredith,I'm a hobo.
Pam,Hmm.
Darryl,I asked for a list. ...and a clown.
Andy,"I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single."
Dwight,"I'm Jigsaw, idiot."
Pam,"Well, are you dating anyone?"
Darryl,"You're not as scary as Book Face, over there."
Andy,What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
Jim,Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Pam,Ah.
Darryl,"Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!"
Andy,You think I can do better?
Kids,Yeah!
Pam,Ah.
Michael,"Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?"
Andy,Gotta get my goin' out on.
Michael,Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
Meredith,"Hey, let's watch this thing."
Michael,It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
Jim,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this."
Darryl,What the hell is wrong with you?
Oscar,How can we not watch this?
Michael,Who wants candy?
Jim,What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
Michael,...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
Phyllis,"We're not mocking, we're watching."
Jim,Wow.
Jim,That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
Michael,Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
Phyllis,"Well, we'll deal with it as it comes."
Jim,I bet we would.
Michael,Is this the tape of me falling?
Michael,They have a TCBY booth.
Phyllis,Yes. Put the DVD in.
Jim,Cool.
Kevin,Open QuickTime.
Michael,The same stuff you get downtown.
Oscar,It starts on it's own. Let it -
Jim,Mmm-hmm.
Kevin,No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Michael,Do you like TCBY?
Jim,Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
Jim,Who doesn't?
Michael,No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
Michael,I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
Jim,What are you doing?
Erin,I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
Michael,It's alright. I can handle it.
Jim,"Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me."
Jim,No.
Erin,They said the both of you.
Michael,"I am a grown-up, Jim."
Jim,That is a mistake.
Meredith,Shh. It's on.
Michael,You should give them a call. Check that out.
Kevin,Here they come. Boom!
Jim,"Alright. Let's clear this up. Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?"
Oscar,Oh. Did - did you see that?
Michael,"Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?"
Jim,See what?
Jim,Great. See ya' then.
Angela,Why'd you stop it?
Michael,Wha- what?
Jim,"Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it."
Jim,They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Oscar,"Jim, you let Michael fall in."
Michael,"Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand."
Dwight,Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Jim,"I absolutely don't understand, either."
Jim,Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Michael,"I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright."
Michael,I don't think you froze.
Jim,Alright.
Jim,It's a killer new dance move. Do you wanna talk in your office?
Michael,Let me get your stroller.
Angela,No.
Jim,"Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?"
Jim,I didn't ask you. Would you like to talk?
Michael,What are you gonna call him?
Dwight,Judas.
Jim,Dave.
Dwight,"Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-"
Michael,No. What is his name?
Jim,"I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job."
Jim,Dave.
Michael,Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
Michael,Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
Meredith,"Hey, what's up lifeguard?"
Jim,Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
Oscar,"Jim, I think I'm in your way."
Michael,"Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?"
Michael,Oscar's a douche.
Jim,"Yes, it is."
Jim,He's alright.
Michael,...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
Michael,"No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok."
Jim,No thanks.
Jim,Thanks Michael.
Michael,They are into style.
Michael,You're welcome. Whoa! Almost fell.
Jim,Mmm-hmm.
Pam,"Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?"
Michael,They are into appearance. We are selling success.
Erin,"Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them."
Jim,...and paper.
Pam,Ok.
Michael,That's sorta secondary.
Erin,Thanks.
Jim,Nope. No.
Pam,Mmm-hmm.
Jim,He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
Erin,"How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?"
Pam,Here we are outside-
Pam,"No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool."
Andy,WB!
Erin,"Yeah, he is!"
Pam,#NAME?
Pam,"Yeah, he is."
Andy,Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.
Erin,"He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met."
Pam,The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
Pam,That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.
Andy,Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
Erin,Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
Pam,Here it is. Suite 401.
Pam,I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
Andy,Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
Pam,I know. Now you don't have to.
Andy,"Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. Suite 401."
Michael,Alright. Hi. Any messages?
Erin,You're soaking wet.
Michael,"Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning."
Phyllis,Wow. Sounds scary.
Michael,It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
Angela,Why isn't Jim wet?
Jim,I outran it.
Meredith,I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Michael,It rained.
Dwight,"Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?"
Michael,Nothing. Cocoa.
Jim,I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
Michael,Good. Yep.
Secretary,Must be nice to have company on these cold calls.
Andy,We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.
Secretary,How exciting! Do you guys know the s*x yet?
Pam,"Oh. No, no. We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together."
Andy,Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
Erin,"Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond."
Michael,Ok. Thank you.
Stanley,Did you say 'Koi pond'?
Michael,Yeah?
Erin,"Michael, people are asking questions."
Michael,"Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?"
Phyllis,"Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?"
Michael,Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
Oscar,"Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?"
Jim,Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Michael,It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
Angela,So you fell in?
Michael,No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
Angela,So a child had fallen in?
Michael,Not yet!
Kevin,That is hilarious.
Michael,"No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying."
Jim,"Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out."
Pam,And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
Customer,Well that sounds like a really nice deal.
Andy,Sha-bow.
Customer,"And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too."
Andy,"Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not."
Customer,My mistake. Sorry.
Pam,It's ok.
Andy,"Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine."
Customer,That- that's good for you.
Pam,"Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes."
Andy,"Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like."
Pam,Yeah.
Pam,You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
Andy,No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
Pam,"You blew the sale, you idiot."
Andy,Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
Michael,"Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?"
Erin,"Staples? Uh, David Wallace called."
Michael,Oh. He did? What did he say?
Erin,"He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it."
Michael,Ok.
Kevin,I'm gonna kill you.
Stanley,"Michael, don't listen to them."
Michael,"Thank you, Stanley."
Stanley,You just ignore their carp.
Michael,Ok.
Dwight,Michael?
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
Creed,"Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?"
Michael,"I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story."
Oscar,Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
Phyllis,"And when you fell in, did you flounder?"
Dwight,"Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -"
Michael,I know what a flounder is.
Michael,I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
Michael,The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
Phyllis,"Michael, you make fun of us every day."
Michael,Uh...
Kevin,Yeah. Every single day.
Michael,You never said anything.
Meredith,"Uh, we have. Countless times."
Michael,"Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'"
Angela,That's never the case.
Michael,"We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on."
Dwight,I don't want people making fun of my nose.
Michael,Your nose?
Dwight,It's too small.
Michael,Alright.
Oscar,Oh my. That is small.
Dwight,"Just, write it down, please."
Oscar,Can you breathe okay?
Kelly,What keeps your glasses on?
Dwight,"Hey! It's on the list, everybody."
Michael,No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
Kevin,I don't want people making fun of my weight.
Michael,Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? Meredith?
Meredith,I don't want to say it out loud.
Michael,Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Meredith,I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do?
Michael,Ok.
Andy,That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
Keena Gifford,"Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple."
Andy,Well-
Pam,Oh- Thank you.
Keena Gifford,Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do.
Pam,"Well, you know."
Andy,Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
Pam,He loves to eat.
Andy,I love to dance-
Pam,I love to watch him dance.
Andy,Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
Pam,And I'll just watch him.
Keena Gifford,And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.
Pam,Yes.
Andy,Yeah. We are thrilled.
Pam,Mmm-hmm.
Andy,"In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?"
Pam,"It was, sweetie."
Keena Gifford,Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.
Andy,Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
Keena Gifford,Yeah!
Andy,Yeah.
Angela,"This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel."
Phyllis,"So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?"
Erin,"Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died."
Michael,It's a fish.
Erin,They want you to pay for it.
Michael,It could've died of natural causes. So...
Erin,"Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer."
Oscar,When is the funeral?
Michael,"Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?"
Erin,$300.00 
Michael,What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
Creed,"Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?"
Jim,"Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it."
Michael,"No, no."
Dwight,Thank you.
Michael,No. We are not done here. This-
Andy,"One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!"
Keena Gifford,That's great!
Andy,"Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me."
Pam,"Yeah, well, that'll happen."
Andy,"Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too."
Pam,Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
Andy,"Message received, little soy bean."
Jim,"I think you just gotta ride this one out, man."
Michael,"No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'."
Jim,"No, they don't."
Michael,"Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail."
Jim,Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Michael,I want to make fun of you right now.
Jim,"Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball."
Michael,No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
Jim,See?
Michael,"Oh, my God."
Michael,"Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to."
Phyllis,"Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?"
Michael,"Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem."
Dwight,"Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself."
Michael,"It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice."
Kevin,Enjoying your nut?
Oscar,Kevin.
Angela,Why?
Kevin,I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Angela,I was.
Michael,Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
Jim,"Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so..."
Kevin,We'll stay late.
Andy,"Well, that went pretty well."
Dwight,Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?
Pam,Why?
Stanley,Thank you.
Michael,Because of all the good work you've done.
Dwight,"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you."
Pam,I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Andy,Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
Michael,"That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude."
Dwight,"Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?"
Pam,I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Phyllis,"This is really nice Dwight, thanks."
Michael,Do you want the raise or what?
Andy,Thanks.
Pam,"Yeah, I'll take it."
Dwight,"Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one."
Michael,"Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude."
Dwight,Good morning Michael.
Pam,You're bribing me?
Michael,Morning Dwight.
Michael,No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
Dwight,Hungry?
Pam,I want to hit you.
Michael,No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
Michael,What?
Dwight,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
Pam,I want to hit you. I'll do that.
Michael,"Well, yeah..."
Michael,"Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?"
Dwight,You're thinking of deer pen1s.
Pam,No. Are you kidding?
Michael,It worked.
Michael,Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
Dwight,Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. Bagel?
Pam,No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Michael,I don't mind if I do.
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,K. I brought cheese too.
Pam,"So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can."
Michael,I'm taking one for my lady friend.
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,Excellent.
Pam,Okay.
Michael,Brain food. Thank you very much.
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,Okay. You owe me.
Pam,See you then.
Dwight,Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?
Michael,See you.
Dwight,"Pam, would you care for a bagel?"
Ryan,Hey.
Pam,"Oh, no thank you."
Michael,Hey.
Dwight,"That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel."
Ryan,Quick question.
Pam,I have an early lunch.
Kelly,Yeah.
Pam,"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out."
Ryan,Are you scared?
Erin,These are amazing. You took all these?
Michael,Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
Ryan,I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?
Ryan,We heard about the punch.
Erin,Oh just by like friends.
Michael,What punch?
Ryan,Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Kelly,Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Helene,Whoohoo! Pammy?
Michael,I'm pretty sure we said slap.
Pam,Hey! Hey. Happy birthday.
Kelly,"No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now."
Helene,Thank you.
Ryan,I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you?
Michael,My girls. There they are.
Michael,I-- mmm-- I'm good.
Michael,"Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your ""Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother"" and fixes all occurrences of ""I don't really see them together"". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food."
Ryan,alright. See you there.
Angela,"Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?"
Michael,Hey.
Pam,I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
Jim,Hey.
Michael,Yeah--
Michael,Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
Kevin,Hi.
Jim,Inappropriate.
Michael,I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?
Michael,I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Helene,Wait a minute. Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.
Jim,All the time.
Kelly,Oh my God I love it.
Michael,Really?
Helene,Tell her how you gave it to me.
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"No, that wouldn't be--"
Michael,She strong?
Helene,He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning. What a nice way to wake up.
Jim,She wants it bad Michael.
Michael,Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
Michael,Can you stop this?
Kevin,Because of s*x?
Jim,I can.
Michael,Hey--
Michael,Okay.
Pam,Kevin!
Jim,And I don't support her choice to hit you.
Michael,"Please, Kevin. You're fired. [Kevin looks at Jim"
Michael,I don't either.
Pam,"Yes, let's go."
Jim,But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Erin,"Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent."
Michael,Mmm-hmm. I know.
Pam,"Oh, you guys. Just one second. Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch."
Jim,I just need some time.
Jim,"Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too."
Michael,You gotta do something--
Pam,I know. Isn't that always how it goes?
Jim,I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
Jim,Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.
Michael,How much time do you think you'll need?
Pam,I want to handle it.
Jim,No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.
Jim,That's okay.
Michael,"Come on, man!"
Pam,I feel like its--
Toby,"Pam, can I talk to you for a second?"
Jim,It's my pleasure. Hello? Well that's great. Turns out the paper was there all along.
Pam,Oh...
Creed,Thank God.
Toby,"I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?"
Creed,Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive.
Pam,Right.
Helene,"So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?"
Toby,"Okay, I think we should probably be okay."
Pam,Yeah-- it's exciting.
Pam,Okay.
Helene,"Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales."
Toby,Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm. Pow!
Jim,Pam's sales are fine actually.
Pam,[stands up
Michael,"Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today."
Toby,Yes.
Pam,Thank you.
Pam,Okay.
Michael,Today is about family.
Toby,Yes.
Pam,Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
Pam,Wow!
Andy,"Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you."
Toby,Okay.
Dwight,Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Meredith,"Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him."
Andy,"Yes! And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory."
Kevin,My money's on Pam.
Dwight,Wow--
Oscar,It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be?
Andy,Feel it against your cheek.
Kevin,Michael could win.
Dwight,I will.
Oscar,How? He can't hit back.
Andy,You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness.
Kevin,Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Dwight,Let me get that door for you--
Michael,Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it. Let's do this.
Andy,Whoa--
Michael,It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
Dwight,There you go!
Kevin,"We're here for the show, Michael."
Andy,Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you.
Michael,You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
Dwight,"Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees."
Kelly,It has almost no calories.
Andy,Is that right?
Pam,Are you ready?
Dwight,Observe.
Michael,Yes.
Andy,Huh. [laughs
Pam,[goes to punch Michael
Dwight,Right?
Michael,I know. Okay. Alright. Oh-- God!
Andy,That really works.
Pam,"Michael, you have to put your hands down."
Dwight,"Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay."
Angela,Put your hands in your pockets.
Andy,"Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus."
Michael,"Okay! Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry."
Dwight,And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
Pam,What are you sorry for?
Andy,Whoa-- thank you very much. Oh boy.
Michael,So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
Dwight,Thank you very much for that.
Pam,How about for dating my mom?
Andy,You are very welcome.
Michael,Maybe that--
Dwight,Have a seat. Allow me.
Pam,And dumping her on her birthday.
Andy,Have a seat yourself.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
Pam,Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
Andy,Not necessary.
Michael,Okay. I promise. For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him
Dwight,"No, no, no!"
Phyllis,Holy crap.
Andy,You didn't have to do that.
Pam,Are you okay?
Dwight,Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.
Michael,No!
Michael,Hello. Scott. Table for four.
Pam,You're okay.
Hostess,Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment.
Jim,Feel better?
Pam,"I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too."
Pam,No. You were right.
Michael,What table should we take? So many to choose from.
Dwight,[walks with Michael back into the office
Jim,Wow.
Michael,I don't know.
Helene,Oh my God!
Dwight,Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Michael,"What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!"
Michael,"As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me."
Pam,"Michael, you did all this?"
Michael,Ahh...
Michael,Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
Dwight,"Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down."
Helene,"Well, thank you. All of you."
Michael,Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
Michael,"Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day."
Dwight,Fire Jim.
Helene,Oh you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.
Michael,No.
Michael,Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
Dwight,I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.
Pam,"So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?"
Michael,What are you talking about--
Helene,Sticking with 49.
Dwight,Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.
Pam,49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.
Michael,Forget that.
Michael,That's funny.
Dwight,Can I have an office?
Helene,"Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?"
Michael,No.
Jim,"Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too."
Dwight,You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.
Michael,You're 54 years old.
Michael,Oh that feels better.
Helene,No. I'm 58.
Michael,You're 58 years old?
Helene,Uh huh.
Michael,Congratulations.
Michael,The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.
Pam,"Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?"
Helene,"Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma."
Pam,Please be Grandma.
Jim,Definitely Grandma.
Pam,I want you to be Grandma.
Helene,"Oh, Michael what do you think? Grandma?"
Michael,That--
Pam,"Yay, Grandma!"
Michael,"Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?"
Pam,Maybe.
Michael,Helene?
Helene,"Oh, oh no. I don't think so."
Michael,"I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?"
Helene,"Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just-- doesn't interest me."
Michael,"So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done."
Helene,"Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming--"
Michael,Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
Helene,Oh--
Michael,You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Helene,"No, no..."
Michael,Snowboarding?
Helene,You want to go snowboarding?
Michael,I might.
Helene,"Michael, what are you talking about?"
Michael,Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
Michael,Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.
Andy,Aye-yi-yi!
Dwight,What's going on in here?
Oscar,Andy bought lunch.
Dwight,Oh... no... really?
Andy,"Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness."
Dwight,There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
Andy,"You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone."
Dwight,"Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!"
Michael,So we should get the check?
Pam,What about your gift Michael?
Michael,"Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it."
Helene,I'm sure I won't.
Michael,Yes you will.
Pam,He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
Helene,Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language.
Pam,Aww--
Michael,I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
Helene,A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott. For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.
Michael,That's just an arbitrary title.
Helene,"Ok, there's a penny. What's that from?"
Jim,Penny for your thoughts.
Helene,"It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it."
Jim,Wow.
Pam,That's amazing.
Michael,"It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows."
Helene,A poem!
Michael,Oh that I plagiarized I think.
Helene,I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay...
Jim,Shel Silverstein.
Pam,Yeah.
Helene,"Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene."
Pam,That's really nice Michael.
Michel,I think it sucks.
Helene,"I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful."
Michael,"Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us."
Helene,God... it's a scrapbook.
Pam,Home run Michael.
Jim,You set the bar so high.
Michael,That was a bunt.
Andy,"Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this."
Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered."
Andy,"No, I insist."
Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist."
Andy,"Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous."
Dwight,Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.
Pam,Hey. Where'd you go?
Michael,"Oh, just went to the bathroom."
Pam,And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Michael,I got thirsty.
Pam,"Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake."
Michael,"Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself."
Pam,Cakes really good.
Helene,"Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting."
Michael,"Finish your cake, Helene."
Helene,Hmmm?
Michael,"I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing."
Michael,"Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her."
Pam,"Michael. Michael ,it's okay."
Michael,No it's not.
Pam,"I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy."
Michael,Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
Pam,Well--
Michael,"Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping."
Jim,"Okay, so--"
Michael,"And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there."
Pam,Michael.
Michael,It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer-- [waitress comes over to pour water
Helene,"I, um-- I got it."
Helene,I'm 58. What am I supposed to do now?
Michael,"Well, hobbies--"
Jim,Stop.
Andy,Ahh.
Dwight,What's going on?
Andy,Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.
Dwight,"Alright, move it."
Andy,What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.
Dwight,"Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time."
Andy,It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
Dwight,Got it. To Dwight. Wha-- Starbucks gift card.
Andy,Surprise! It's from everybody. $15 value.
Dwight,Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.
Michael,Pamela Beesly Halpert--
Pam,What?
Michael,May I have a word with you in my office please?
Pam,I am working.
Michael,"Well, this is a work related matter."
Pam,Really?
Michael,Yes.
Pam,Really?
Michael,"Yes. Join me please, won't you? I am going to give you a raise."
Dwight,"Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!"
Pam,It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!
Jim,"Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change."
Jim,"Yeah, I want to go home."
Dwight,How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch
Pam,"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car."
Jim,"OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know."
Dwight,"No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!"
Kevin,No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Dwight,False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!
Jim,"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you."
Dwight,That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.
Jim,"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?"
Dwight,Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. Block. Grasp wrist as such.
Jim,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two."
Dwight,"Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!"
Jim,"Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool."
Dwight,"He really is, but not for long. Ow! Instep, oh, not again. You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on."
Jim,You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Dwight,The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.
Michael,But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
Andy,I did stand up comedy once.
Michael,You did?
Andy,"Yeah, I killed."
Michael,That sounds like it was hilarious.
Andy,It was hilarious.
Dwight,Michael?
Michael,Yes?
Dwight,What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
Michael,"You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day."
Dwight,"This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin."
Michael,"Woo hoo, shout out!"
Dwight,Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
Michael,"Erin, do we have the journal?"
Erin,Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.
Michael,Did you?
Pam,"Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online."
Michael,"Oh, the Wall."
Oscar,"I found the article. ""On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend... "" and the article cuts off."
Michael,It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?
Jim,Are you serious?
Andy,"I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it."
Phyllis,"""It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy."""
Michael,"No, no, that doesn't make any sense."
Stanley,"Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs."
Oscar,"Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt."
Michael,"Oh, that sounds awful."
Oscar,Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Michael,"Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory."
Dwight,You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
David Wallace's Secretary,"I'm sorry, Michael, David's in a meeting."
Michael,"Ah, well maybe you should spy on him. Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious!"
David Wallace's Secretary,"Um, I'll just have him call you back."
Michael,"OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye. He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free."
Kevin,"Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there?"
Michael,"No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be."
Kevin,It smells like throw up in here.
Michael,Crazy world. Lotta smells.
Kelly,"Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again?"
Andy,"I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws."
Jim,We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
Michael,"OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins."
Jim,"Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along."
Michael,"Monkey see, monkey do."
Jim,That's it.
Michael,Monkey pee all over you.
Jim,"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?"
Michael,We have a monthly staff meeting
Jim,"Alright, let's conference room it up! Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working."
Jim,"Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good."
Jim,"Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that."
Dwight,He needs me. Seat saved infinity.
Jim,"OK, great."
Michael,What? Oh my God! There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah.
Michael,"Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across."
Meredith,"Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game."
Michael,"It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it..."
Jim,"Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea."
Michael,"This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder."
Jim,I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
Michael,"Tube City, you owe me one."
Jim,"Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one."
Voice on CD player,"August the 5th, 1955. It's a sad day down here in Savannah. Local magnate Bill Bourbon was killed last night and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal to celebrate Bill as he passes on to his great reward. You're not just here to pay your respects, you have to figure out which of y'all is the no-count scoundrel who killed him."
Stanley,This is ridiculous.
Michael,"There will be food. You leave, you do not get food."
Stanley,What kind of food?
Michael,Sandwich platters.
Stanley,I'm in.
Michael,Baby carrots.
Michael,"OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse."
Kevin,"Whoa, I'll try it."
Michael,"OK, use your imaginations."
Andy,Who'd you get?
Erin,"Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal."
Andy,"Oooooo, saucy."
Erin,How about you?
Andy,"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother."
Angela,"Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary."
Michael,It's not scary.
Angela,I don't like my character.
Pam,Who are you?
Angela,"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this."
Michael,"Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful."
Michael,"Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare?"
Oscar,"It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company."
Michael,"Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare."
Ryan,"You don't have to keep saying ""I do declare"". Any time you say something it means you are declaring."
Michael,That is the way Southern people talk.
Jim,And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
Michael,"Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?"
Pam,I'll go. My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short.
Andy,"That's clever, Debutante."
Pam,Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
Meredith,Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump.
Pam,I do not.
Andy,"Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth."
Kevin,"Oooo, now do the Swedish chef."
Andy,"Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?"
Kevin,"He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass."
Phyllis,"You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept."
Dwight,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!"
Michael,"No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing."
Dwight,I will poison your food.
Andy,"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind."
Michael,"Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!"
Michael,I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
Kevin,Y'all.
Creed,"Sorry I'm late, boss. What's going on?"
Michael,"Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect."
Creed,OK. Hang on just a second. Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
Michael,"Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar."
Andy,Hey there young lady.
Erin,Hello.
Andy,I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
Erin,"Sounds like a plan, Sugar."
Andy,"Alright, a plan it is."
Dwight,"Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts."
Angela,"It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter."
Dwight,I know you did it!
Dwight,"I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect."
Kevin,Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.
Erin,"Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay."
Meredith,How about a threesome?
Erin,"Yeah, my boudoir's always open."
Kevin,Nice.
Andy,"I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer."
Oscar,"I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors."
Phyllis,What does that mean?
Oscar,"Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-"
Michael,"Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah."
Oscar,"This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay... - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern."
Jim,"OK, I'm going back to work."
Michael,No no no no no no no. I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go.
Voice on CD player,Well by now you've figured out that ol' Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.
Phyllis,"Michael, I was doing so well."
Michael,"Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is. Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?"
Jim,"OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting."
Kevin,That could be a good sign.
Angela,"Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up."
Jim,"Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work."
Kevin,"Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign."
Angela,Don't just say things.
Jim,"Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-"
Michael,"I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case."
Jim,"No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed."
Michael,No it ain't.
Dwight,"Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns."
Andy,"Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time."
Erin,I haven't seen it.
Andy,"Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?"
Erin,"Of course, Nathaniel."
Andy,"Yeah, OK."
Erin,Where are you taking me?
Andy,"Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah."
Erin,Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton.
Andy,Did you mean a real date?
Erin,No. Did you?
Andy,Totally... not.
Erin,"I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game."
Dwight,"You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?"
Michael,"I already declared you, it was too dark to tell."
Dwight,"Stop playing games with me, Crawdad."
Michael,"This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir."
Dwight,Answer me.
Michael,You are out of order.
Dwight,You are out of order.
Michael,You are-
Pam,I think Michael may have snapped.
Jim,Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
Pam,"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?"
Jim,Both. They're both worse.
Jim,"It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under."
Pam,"Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one."
Michael,"Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?"
Jim,"Michael, not now."
Michael,"Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on."
Pam,I should just go. Where to now Caleb?
Michael,To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
Jim,"Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why."
Michael,Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
Meredith,I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
Dwight,Hey shut up. You're dead.
Jim,"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?"
Michael,"No Michael here, my name is-"
Jim,Caleb!
Jim,Today of all days...
Michael,"No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright?"
Michael,"Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for?"
Erin,Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.
Michael,Detective Wallace?
Erin,I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Michael,"Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here."
Oscar,You're not gonna answer the phone?
Michael,"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room."
Jim,I'll take it.
Jim,Hey David.
David,"Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet."
Jim,"Oh, OK."
David,"But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK?"
Jim,"Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-"
David,"You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run."
Jim,OK.
David,Thanks Jim.
Jim,See ya.
Pam,What's the news?
Jim,Nothing yet.
Phyllis,"Well, I guess that's not-"
Jim,Well there is some bad news. There has been another murder.
Michael,"A murder, you say? I do declare."
Jim,Conference room everyone.
Stanley,Do we have to play?
Jim,No.
Stanley,Super.
Dwight,"Oh, this could be a juicy one."
Michael,Get in there!
Jim,"I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now."
Michael,"There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more. Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time."
Andy,I didn't do it!
Dwight,"OK, everybody just calm down."
Andy,I am calm.
Michael,On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
Dwight,I have crossbows.
Michael,"We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?"
Dwight,"OK, I'm ready."
Michael,"One, two, three.."
Jim,"Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6"
Jim,Really?
Oscar,Not again.
Michael,It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
Dwight,Bow down before Recyclops.
Oscar,"I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands."
Jim,"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops."
Michael,That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
Dwight,"Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?"
Oscar,I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
Jim,The next year he really stepped things up.
Michael,"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. What are you doing?"
Dwight,Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
Oscar,"Michael, I didn't ask to come up here."
Jim,A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Michael,"Wow, man. That -"
Dwight,Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Oscar,What?
Jim,Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Michael,That was embarrassing.
Dwight,Recyclops will have his revenge.
Oscar,For me.
Jim,I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Michael,"For me, too. You embarrassed me."
Pam,"Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops."
Oscar,You -
Dwight,Recyclops destroys!
Michael,"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow."
Stanley,"Oh, is today Recyclops Day?"
O'Keefe,He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,"Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron."
Stanley,I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
Michael,
Dwight,Polluticorn wishes.
Michael,"Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate."
Andy,That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
O'Keefe,He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride.
Dwight,Humans are terrible for the environment.
Michael,Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
Pam,The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
Alan,"The gentleman in the, uh, glasses."
Jim,Mmm.
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to."
Pam,A world where you truly can be anything you want.
Alan,Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions.
Jim,"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart."
Dwight,Yeah.
Michael,Ok. Ok. How 'bout this?
Pam,That's great.
Michael,"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing."
Pam,Sure.
Michael,Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
Meredith,And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Michael,"Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild."
Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott."
Pam,Don't do the twirl.
Phyllis,Lose the twirl.
Dwight,The twirl sucks.
Kevin,"Michael, I hated the twirl."
Andy,Hate the twirl!
Michael,Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
Phyllis,"Yeah, good. Don't do it."
Michael,"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin."
Oscar,The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
Michael,"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points."
Oscar,Those are the bullet points.
Michael,"Well, could you condense it please?"
Oscar,That's as simple as I can make it.
Erin,Michael? The limo's here for you.
Michael,"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling."
Erin,"He said limousine, so..."
Kevin,"Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. Michael, look. Oh, man."
Michael,They sent a limo.
Michael,Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
Michael,"Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that."
Dwight,What kind of mileage does this baby get?
Erin,It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
Oscar,This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
Michael,Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
Dwight,Calves. Calves all the way.
Andy,I'm so jealous right now.
Michael,"Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-"
Limo Driver,Car seats eight.
Michael,What?
Limo Driver,The car seats eight.
Michael,The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
Jim & Pam,No thanks.
Ryan,I'll use it when you're done.
Michael,Mmm... whoa.
Oscar,"The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers."
Michael,I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.
Andy,"Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had s*x in here?"
Michael,Definitely.
Dwight,Smells like it.
Michael,Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
Dwight,Word.
Andy,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Michael,Who's playing with the button?
Jim,"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?"
Ryan,"Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under."
Jim,But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
Ryan,"The company's probably going under, though."
Jim,Could go either way.
Ryan,Seems like it's leaning one way.
Jim,Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Ryan,Definitely.
Jim,Ok.
Ryan,So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
Jim,Nah. Might as well do it now.
Andy,"Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?"
Michael,I will have to answer.
Dwight,I'll ask you a question.
Andy,"Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park."
Dwight,Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
Michael,"No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' I won't say that. I'll something like that."
Andy,This is your big day. Come on.
Michael,"Oh, my god. This is it."
Laurie,Mr. Scott?
Michael,Yes.
Laurie,I'm Laurie.
Michael,"Oh, hi."
Laurie,Thank you for joining us. Come with me.
Michael,"Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott."
Laurie,Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge.
Michael,"Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -"
Andy,Kay.
Dwight,"Good luck, Michael."
Michael,See you later.
Michael,Officers. Thank you.
Laurie,"After you, Mr. Scott."
Michael,Thank you.
David,Michael.
Michael,Hello.
David,So glad you could make it.
Michael,Thank you.
David,How was the ride?
Michael,"Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime."
David,"I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton."
Alan,"It's nice to meet you, Michael."
Michael,"It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege."
David,"Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe."
Michael,Ah. Your eminence.
Registrar,"For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles."
Dwight,"Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Ah. Damn it. Wha- okay"
Dwight,"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy."
Oscar,"Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple."
Andy,"Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line."
Oscar,"Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you."
Andy,"Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?"
Dwight,How is he gonna have grandkids?
Michael,You guys ever protect the president?
Security,No.
Michael,What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
Security,Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly Furtado.
Alan,"Alright, guys. You ready?"
Michael,Rock and roll.
Alan,Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever.
Michael,This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
David,It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
Michael,"We're going bankrupt, you think? They are really angry."
Alan,The shareholders need to empower our leadership -
Woman in line,I'm just gonna run to the bathroom. Will you save my place?
Man in line,Sure.
Dwight,No. You will not.
Woman in line,Excuse me?
Dwight,"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?"
Woman in line,It'll just be a second.
Dwight,Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Alan,"... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager."
Dwight,Yes.
Alan,"In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael. Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford."
Jim,"Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?"
Phyllis,Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Jim,Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
Phyllis,"Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things."
Jim,I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Stanley,That doesn't make you a boss.
Phyllis,It's not like you can fire people or anything.
Jim,"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?"
Phyllis,Ryan.
Stanley,Can't say.
Phyllis,Sorry. Plastered.
Jim,Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?
Pam,Stuff gets around. I don't participate.
Jim,Who here heard it from Ryan?
Kevin,Does and email count?
Jim,Yes.
Kevin,Yeah.
Jim,I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?
Pam,I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Oscar,These questions are bush league.
Andy,You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. Don't be a wuss.
Andy,"I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose ."
David,"Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship."
Shareholder,You're a criminal.
Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -"
Female Shareholder,Limousine?
Michael,Yes.
Second Shareholder,You're all corrupt. You should be in jail.
Alan,"Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions."
Ryan,Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
Creed,"I don't know, man. I just don't know."
Jim,I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
Pam,Can you actually fire people?
Jim,"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people."
Pam,"Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone."
Jim,"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell."
Pam,"Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'."
Jim,"Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day."
Pam,"Well, you'll figure it out."
Alan,Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions.
Third Shareholder,You haven't said anything yet and we're headed for bankruptcy.
Michael,"Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -"
Fourth Shareholder,How are you gonna fix the company?
Michael,"Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. And you can take that to the bank. And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. I love you, New York! You. You."
Jim,"Hey, Ryan. How's it going?"
Ryan,"Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist..."
Jim,Mmm-hmm.
Ryan,That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
Jim,"Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it."
Ryan,Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
Jim,You know what?
Ryan,What?
Jim,I think I know the problem.
Ryan,Great.
Jim,I think you seem distracted.
Ryan,"Yep, that is a problem."
Jim,"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help."
Ryan,"Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim."
Jim,"I am, too. Let me show you."
Michael,Wow. Things are really picking up.
O'Keefe,What was that about?
Michael,What?
Alan,You were supposed to wave.
Michael,I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
David,What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
Michael,"We tell them the plan, right?"
David,There is no plan.
Michael,"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes."
O'Keefe,Excuse me?
Michael,Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
O'Keefe,Who the hell is this guy?
Michael,I am the guy who roused that crowd.
David,Yes.
Michael,Got them on their feet.
David,Yes.
Michael,They were so happy down there.
David,Yes.
Alan,Who cares?
Michael,"Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor."
David,"No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael."
Michael,"Well, I'm texting him, so."
David,"Please do not text anybody, now, Michael."
Michael,It's done.
Michael,"Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away."
Jim,"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people."
Ryan,Mmm-hmm.
Jim,"Let me show you what I mean. Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done."
Ryan,"I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight."
Jim,Right.
Ryan,"Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything."
Jim,You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it.
Ryan,Is there internet?
Oscar,Ummm...
Michael,Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
Oscar,Ok
Michael,Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
Oscar,Um..
Andy,You wanted to see me?
Erin,"No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy."
Michael,"Yeah, Have a seat."
Michael,"You're what, like, 12?"
Andy,Is it serious? Wow. Andy's a wittle scared.
Erin,"The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think."
Michael,"Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk."
Michael,I think you're doing a great job.
Andy,Why would people say that?
Erin,Really?
Michael,I have it on good authority that you said the following. Can you read that back to me?
Michael,"What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?"
Andy,Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
Erin,I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Michael,Mmm-hmm.
Michael,Really?
Andy,"Would you rather me say ""Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?"""
Erin,"Yes, but I'm terrible at math so..."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse."
Andy,"""Crazy diarrhea happening right now?"" Cause things can get real adult real fast."
Erin,Seriously?
Michael,"You are also on record as saying ""wittle-ittle,"" ""footy-wutties,"" ""nummies,"" ""jammies,"" ""make boom-boom,"" ""widiculous,"" and ""wode iwand."""
Michael,Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too.
Andy,"Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy."
Michael and Erin,"Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true."
Michael,You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies.
Jim,"See you tomorrow, Dwight."
Andy,"Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying."
Dwight,Apparently.
Michael,"Okay, who said that?"
Ryan,How's it going? Good day?
Andy,"I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic."
Dwight,"Not now, Temp."
Michael,"Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops."
Ryan,"Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan."
Andy,Tank you Mr. Elwis.
Dwight,What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol...
Michael,"You're welcome, baby."
Ryan,I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
Andy,"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news."
Dwight,So what do you want?
Jim,"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?"
Ryan,I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in.
Andy,The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
Jim,"Wow, what do you put our chances at?"
Andy,"0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!"
Jim,"Hmm, sounds risky."
Andy,Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
Andy,"Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron."
Jim,"Wow, that's not such a bad idea."
Andy,Great!
Jim,Anything else?
Andy,Nope!
Erin,Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those.
Michael,Keep.
Erin,"There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say ""Delivered."" Should I delete all of those?"
Michael,I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
Erin,"That's why you have a ""Sent Mail"" folder."
Michael,Keep.
Erin,"There's about 30 news alerts for ""Nip Slip."""
Michael,For what?
Erin,"""Nip slip."""
Michael,Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there...
Erin,Well...
Michael,Must be hackers.
Jim,Hey. What's up?
Michael,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?"
Jim,Did you murder someone?
Michael,Worse than that.
Erin,"Oh, my God."
Michael,Lurk much? I miss Pam.
Jim,I think she's okay.
Michael,"Is that what we're going for now? ""okay?"" We used to go for ""pretty good."""
Jim,"Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?"
Michael,"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but..."
Jim,"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager."
Michael,"Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month."
Jim,It would look bad. Sorry.
Michael,"It would look good, on my mantle."
Andy,Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!
Dwight,Yeah! Your idea.
Dwight,"My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired."
Erin,"Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?"
Pam,Looks great.
Erin,"Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't."
Pam,Okay. The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
Michael,There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
Phyllis,"What's ""Scott's Tots?"""
Stanley,Has it really been ten years?
Stanley,"""Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders"""
Pam,"Michael, why did you promise that?"
Michael,To change lives.
Pam,"No Michael, why would you promise that?"
Michael,"Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this."
Erin,We've already rescheduled seven times.
Pam,"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done."
Michael,Well...
Pam,It's terrible.
Michael,No.
Pam,"Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get."
Michael,"I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous."
Michael,"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?"
Pam,No!
Michael,"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right."
Pam,You have to tell them.
Michael,"Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of..."
Erin,I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
Pam,"It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth."
Michael,"Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?"
Dwight,"Hey Jimmy, what's up?"
Jim,Not much.
Dwight,"Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office."
Jim,Thanks Dwight.
Dwight,That laugh is so infectious.
Jim,You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.
Dwight,I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.
Jim,"Let me guess, you think you should get it."
Dwight,"This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize."
Jim,"Well, in an ideal world..."
Dwight,"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching."
Jim,"Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away ""Survival Skills"" and ""Self-defense."""
Dwight,I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
Jim,"That's okay, I'll do it."
Mikela,Mr. Scott?
Michael,"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?"
Mikela,I'm good.
Michael,Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone?
Mikela,"It's in the music room, Mr. Scott."
Michael,"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind."
Erin,Wow!
Michael,"Well, you didn't even hear it."
Mikela,Everyone's so excited that you're here today.
Michael,"Oh, good."
Mikela,"Now, I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first?"
Michael,Sure.
Erin,You're famous.
Mikela,I'm sure you remember this place.
Michael,"Oh, yeah."
Mikela,Do you want to go in?
Michael,"No, not at all. Nope, come on."
Michael,"Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just..."
Mikela,We just want to say thanks.
Michael,Oh.
Students,Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!
Teacher,"Mr. Scott, I know you're a busy man, and your schedule moves around a lot. But through all your generosity through the years, your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you."
Students,"Oh! What? Oh! Break it down! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!"
Lefevre,"You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don't need to compromise, cause we can have it all! Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable!"
Students,"Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!"
Michael,Wow!
Dwight,"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-"
Kevin,Hey.
Dwight,So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
Kevin,Jim said that?
Dwight,He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
Kevin,Jim said that?
Dwight,You seem suprised.
Kevin,"No, no, that makes total sense."
Dwight,"Hey buddy, so every-"
Oscar,Sure.
Dwight,Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule.
Teacher,"Politicians are always coming around, telling us they're going to fix our schools, promising this and that. But you, Mr. Scott, you are actually doing it. You have taught these kids with hard work, that anything is possible. You are a dream maker and I thank you! I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you! So much."
Lefevre,"There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game. But I always thought back to my guardian angel, and the gift that you gave me. So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself, and become the next President Obama."
Michael,"Oh, God. Oh, God."
Jim,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is?"
Andy,"Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert."
Everyone,Huh? What?
Oscar,Are you kidding me?
Dwight,"Oh, no!"
Jim,"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-"
Kevin,I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
Jim,"Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score."
Angela,"To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us."
Jim,"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize."
Angela,Yes!
Jim,Dwight?
Dwight,"Yeah, you said ""In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize."" Isn't that what you said?"
Jim,"No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But-"
Phyllis,"Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money."
Teacher,"Let's put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour, Mr. Michael Scott."
Michael,"All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between ""A"" gym and ""B"" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm. Should we go?"
Teacher,"Oh, no. We're okay. It's a double period"
Michael,"Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?"
Zion,"I'm Zion, I'm Mikela's younger brother."
Michael,"Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry."
Michael,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Mikela,You lied to us.
Michael,"I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place."
Lefevre,You owe this to us!
Michael,"Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you."
Students,
Michael,"Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium."
Jim,"Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway."
Andy,Correction. It was my idea.
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,My idea!
Creed,"Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant."
Pam,"Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on."
Phyllis,That's fair.
Dwight,"Excellent idea, Pam."
Pam,Thank you.
Andy,"That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert."
Phyllis,"How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?"
Dwight,There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Pam,"No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month."
Andy,"Oh, really? From what, two to four?"
Pam,Yup.
Jim,"Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?"
Deliveryman,"Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert."
Jim,"Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake."
Kevin,Look who it is!
Angela,"""It could only be you!"" Way to go."
Dwight,He knew all along!
Kelly,I'm going to have some cake.
Stephanie,David Wallace's office.
Dwight,"This is Kevin Malone, is David there?"
Stephanie,"No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?"
Dwight,"Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam."
Dwight,This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.
Dwight,"It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here."
Lefevre,"Hey, Mr. Scott."
Michael,"Erin, can you give us a second?"
Lefevre,That was messed up what you did.
Michael,"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry."
Lefevre,Who does something like that? Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn't come through like that?
Michael,What can I do?
Lefevre,You can pay for my college.
Michael,"I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?"
Lefevre,They're expensive.
Michael,"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?"
Lefevre,"It's about $1,000."
Michael,Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year.
Lefevre,"No, $1,000 each year."
Michael,"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around."
Lefevre,"Okay. Okay. Make it out to my mom, Rosa."
Michael,That's a lot of zeroes.
Jim,This is Jim.
David Wallace,"Jim, what the hell is happening there?"
Jim,"Hey, uh David."
David,Yes.
Jim,"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it."
David,"Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?"
Jim,No.
David,Am I missing something?
Jim,"I really don't know how it happened, David."
Dwight,I know how it happened.
David,"Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion."
Jim,"All right, it will not happen again. I promise."
David,"Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you."
Dwight,No!
David,"It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right?"
Dwight,What?
Jim,Yeah. Thank you.
Dwight,No.
David,"Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?"
Dwight,What?
Jim,Yes.
David,Okay.
Dwight,"Oh, you're kidding me!"
Jim,See you.
Dwight,Damn it!
Erin,"Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---"
Michael,Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today.
Erin,No.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,"Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--"
Stanley,We deserve to know.
Jim,Too loud.
Michael,I didn't say anything!
Dwight,#NAME?
Angela,If you know something Michael...
Jim,"Too, too loud. Too Loud."
Michael,We're going out of business!
Dwight,"But effective, look! On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas."
Group,WHAT?
Everyone,Merry Christmas.
Jim,What?
Dwight,Merry Christmas. Good.
Dwight,You are kidding me!
Dwight,My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
Jim,"Wait wait wait, who said that?"
Dwight,It is time to unveil the tree.
Michael,David told me on the phone. David told me.
Oscar,"Hey, Rockefeller Center!"
Dwight,When? When did he tell you? Today?
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,Earlier today.
Ryan,"Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that."
Dwight,Awww!
Jim,This is all we have.
Michael,"He said, we have been sold."
Ryan,Ugh.
Jim,What?
Jim,"No, it's not ""ugh."" It is... office camaraderie."
Dwight,Aaaarrhh!
Dwight,It is warm feelings.
Michael,Dwight! Jesus!
Meredith,Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Angela,Come on!
Dwight,Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!
Jim,"Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?"
Jim,Why would you start so high?
Michael,David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
Dwight,Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
Jim,Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Jim,"Three, two, one!"
Michael,"It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith."
Phyllis,Ooh.
Meredith,"No, I get it."
Pam,Ah!
Michael,I'll call him. I'll call David.
Phyllis,You didn't decorate it?
Jim,"No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone."
Jim,No.
Michael,"Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him."
Dwight,Exactly.
Michael,"He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom."
Jim,"We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together."
David,"Hey Sweetie, what is it?"
Dwight,Everyone.
Michael,"It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott."
Andy,"Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?"
David,What the hell?
Pam,"Is it, is it fake?"
Michael,Stephanie could you hop off please?
Jim,Pam!
David,"Michael, I have never-"
Dwight,"Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die..."
Michael,David!
Jim,Yes.
David,"Ever, ever..."
Dwight,Like the spirit of Christmas!
Michael,"David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse."
Stanley,We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
Dwight,Hey David.
Dwight,This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
Kelly,Hi David!
Erin,Hello. Sorry guys. Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove
David,Hello everyone.
Kelly,What psycho would send that as a gift?
Michael,"David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned."
Andy,I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds?
David,You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.
Phyllis,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!"
Michael,Well I think we're past that now.
Dwight,Hey Santa!
David,"I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know."
Oscar,They finally let you do it!
Jim,"Oh my God, David. That's horrible."
Phyllis,Yeah!
Meredith,"How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman."
Kevin,Congrats Phil!
David,Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works. So congratulations.
Erin,It's so edgy!
Michael,We're not fired?
Phyllis,"I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. It's been a long journey... but I'm Santa Claus!"
David,"No! No, and congratulations."
Pam,"So Santa, what can we expect from this party?"
Michael,Yeah! It's a Christmas miracle!
Phyllis,It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
Dwight,Yeah!
Creed,What if you've been bad?
Michael,Woo hoo!
Phyllis,Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Dwight,"I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone."
Creed,"What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?"
Dwight,It's true. We all walk alone.
Jim,"Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!"
Kelly,Jim.... Jim!
Phyllis,Yeah.
Dwight,My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
Dwight,"For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!"
Toby,Wow! Cause...
Pam,"You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!"
Ryan,Yeah! That was the idea.
Oscar,That's funny.
Toby,Thank you!
Pam,"Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. I think my water just broke!"
Ryan,Awesome!
Oscar,That's too funny.
Toby,Thanks man!
Pam,Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Kevin,"Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging..."
Michael,"Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see."
Michael,Oh! You got it? What is that?
Pam,"Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis."
Dwight,I have no idea.
Michael,What the hell is going on?
Michael,"Huh. Well, maybe those will help."
Michael,"Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?"
Dwight,Michael? Please! Come on!
Jim,Yeah.
Matt,Nice to meet you Oscar.
Michael,Phyllis?
Oscar,Nice to meet you Mark!
Jim,Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
Matt,It's Matt.
Michael,Take it back. That is absurd.
Oscar,"Right, Matt. I know what I'm doing, Pam."
Jim,"No, I'm not gonna do that."
Dwight,"Oh man! I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails..."
Michael,No? No! Jim! Come on!
Michael,Hi Santa.
Jim,I think she's doing a good job.
Phyllis,Hi Michael. Mm. 'kay.
Michael,"It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!"
Michael,I'd like to make a wish.
Jim,I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
Phyllis,What?
Michael,"Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those."
Michael,"I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry."
Michael,"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably ""freedom."" At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore."
Phyllis,An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Michael,"Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!"
Bob Vance,Scott! What in the hell is going on here?
Group,Okay...
Phyllis,"No Bob, we worked it out."
Michael,"No it's not, not like penis-wise. Hello little boy, what's your name?"
Michael,You called Bob?
Kevin,"Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap."
Phyllis,"I'm sorry,"
Michael,"Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well."
Michael,Come on! Phyllis!
Kevin,When can I sit on your lap?
Phyllis,I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
Michael,"Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. Oh my God."
Michael,Okay.
Kevin,That's really comfortable.
Phyllis,Hi sweetie.
Michael,What would you like for Christmas little boy?
Bob,You okay baby?
Kevin,I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
Phyllis,I'm good baby.
Michael,What did you think was going to happen?
Michael,Oh God. Get a room Santas!
Kevin,I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Michael,Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
Michael,"All right, just say ""some toys"" please."
Dwight,It's real slippery out here.
Kevin,Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Jim,Oh my God!
Michael,"Damn it Kevin, come on."
Pam,Twelve drummers drumming.
Kevin,What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
Andy,Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!
Michael,"Okay get off, get off! Oh! Oh, God!"
Kevin,I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Michael,Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
Kevin,Awesome.
Phyllis,Well?
Jim,I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
Phyllis,The only Santa.
Jim,That's what I want.
Phyllis,You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
Jim,What would Bob do?
Phyllis,"Never mind, I shouldn't have said that."
Andy,Does it hurt?
Erin,It stings a lot.
Andy,Hmm.
Erin,I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
Andy,"I know, right?"
Erin,So far no one will admit to it.
Andy,Huh!
Erin,Is it you?
Andy,Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.
Erin,Seriously?
Andy,"""Seriously?"" Are you serious?"
Erin,What?
Andy,Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
Oscar,There he is.
Daryl,Hey.
Oscar,Is Matt around? I got his check.
Daryl,"Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it."
Oscar,"Ah, I'll just... wait for him."
Daryl,"Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think?"
Oscar,I'll just leave it here with you.
Michael,Ryan come here!
Ryan,"Whoa, whoa."
Michael,"Come on, come on."
Ryan,I'm doing something over here.
Michael,Ahhh... Ho ho ho! Come on I need this. Come over here!
Ryan,What are you talking about?
Michael,Just sit down!
Ryan,No no no.
Jim,Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
Michael,Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
Jim,Can I just talk to you for a second?
Michael,"Whoop! Okay, what?"
Jim,"You can't yell out ""I need this, I need this"" as you pin down an employee on your lap!"
Michael,"Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!"
Jim,Yup.
Michael,"Do you understand, you forced my hand?"
Jim,"Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa."
Michael,"Oh, do we? Do ""We?"" Is that what ""we"" want? Why don't ""we"" take a vote on it?"
Jim,Great!
Michael,Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
Jim,Who wants Phyllis as Santa?
Michael,"No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?"
Kevin,Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
Jim,"And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. Can I get you some punch?"
Michael,I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.
Office,"Aw, Michael!"
Dwight,"Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger."
Phyllis,How do you know it's a gun?
Dwight,What else does it look like?
Stanley,Not a gun.
Dwight,Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Stanley,"Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun."
Dwight,Not a gun.
Phyllis,"In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin!"
Michael,"I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. ""Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself."" That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me."
Michael,"Behold! Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget."
Toby,"Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is."
Michael,Oh the Anti-Christ!
Toby,"You can't, Ow. Look, you cannot push religion."
Michael,Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
Toby,No!
Michael,"Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!"
Andy,"Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?"
Phyllis,"All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael."
Andy,Okay.
Kelly and Erin,"I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day..."
Pam,Have you talked to him?
Oscar,Who?
Pam,Matt?
Oscar,Is it that obvious? No- hey...
Pam,"Mmm! Good pate, right? Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?"
Matt,I don't think so.
Pam,"Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate."
Matt,I had some.
Pam,"Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?"
Oscar,Okay Pam.
Pam,Okay.
Pam,Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
Phyllis,This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Dwight,We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot.
Michael,"Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?"
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
Phyllis,Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Stanley,I have.
Michael,"Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?"
Kevin,He got scented candles!
Michael,"Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley."
Angela,Amen.
Phyllis,"And this brings us to you, little one."
Michael,"I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up."
Angela,It's fabric! I really wanted this.
Michael,That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
Angela,"Andy, is this you?"
Michael,No!
Phyllis,It's a secret.
Michael,Andy had Erin.
Andy,Nnnnya.
Michael,What? Was I not supposed to say it? What? Turn it back on.
Jim,No.
David,"Yes Michael, what is so urgent?"
Michael,"David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as."
David,I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
Michael,I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
David,Michael...
Michael,"I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa."
David,Michael-
Michael,What?
David,This is a very very bad time.
Michael,Really? What's going on?
David,"Stephanie, can you hop off please?"
Stephanie,Sure David.
Michael,What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
Erin,Do you want me off the call too Michael?
Michael,Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
David,"Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house."
Michael,What does that mean?
David,I'll be fired.
Michael,"Well, can't Alan protect you?"
David,Alan will be out too. All of us.
Michael,All of us?
David,Goodbye Michael.
Michael,Oh my God.
Michael,"Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into."
Michael,Hey. How's everybody doing?
Jim,Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
Michael,That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
Angela,Are you serious? This is so offensive.
Michael,"You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room."
Dwight,What's your pin number?
Michael,"I don't want to say. But, ""it's fun to stay at the -"""
Michael,"""It's fun to stay at the -"""
Dwight,Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
Michael,"Mmm, mm mm mm."
Andy,"I, I thought that you would like it."
Erin,It was a little much Andy.
Andy,Well it's the thought that counts.
Erin,What were you thinking?
Andy,"I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen."
Michael,"You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, ""How could they do this to us?"""
Jim,What?
Pam,How could we do what?
Michael,It's not... Nevermind. Nothing.
Michael,"Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way"
Eric,Hi -
Computron,"Hello, Eric Ward. Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. I am Computron, your answer to everything."
Eric,Hello.
Michael,"I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?"
Computron,Yes.
Michael,What is the world's largest ocean?
Computron,Calculating. Calculating. Pacific!
Michael,"Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?"
Andy,"Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL."
Michael,"That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant."
Pam,Hello.
Computron,The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972.
Pam,Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
Pam,"It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are."
Michael,"Hello, Stanley."
Fake Stanley,Hi.
Pam,"For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it."
Eric,"Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here."
Michael,"Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -"
Eric,Right.
Michael,"- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?"
Eric,Yeah.
Michael,They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
Computron,Mul Yam in Tel Aviv is better.
Michael,"No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it."
Computron,Are you calling me wrong?
Michael,"Oh, my God."
Eric,"It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker."
Michael,Alright. Excuse me. If you will -
Ryan,"Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -"
Michael,"- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two."
Dwight,"Oh, we will. Have a seat."
Michael,"I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time."
Eric,"So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character."
Dwight,"He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?"
Toby,"What are, are you doing at my desk?"
Dwight,Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
Toby,"Come on, Dwight. Get out of here."
Dwight,"Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. Welcome."
Toby,"Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?"
Eric,"Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?"
Toby,What do you mean?
Eric,"Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits."
Toby,Um... nothing comes to mind.
Eric,"So, the staff?"
Toby,Mm-hmm.
Eric,Are people generally happy?
Toby,Happy's a funny word.
Eric,In what way?
Toby,"You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. Keep philosophers busy for awhile."
Eric,So... generally?
Toby,Yes.
Eric,Generally.
Toby,Generally happy.
Eric,Generally happy.
Eric,"What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that?"
Toby,"Oh, I don't know."
Eric,"You, you don't know."
Toby,I don't know.
Eric,You're the head of Human Resources.
Toby,I don't know. No.
Eric,Ok.
Toby,I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
Michael,"Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?"
Toby,"Well, Eric's just going over some stuff."
Michael,Stuff. I love stuff.
Toby,"It's, uh, it's HR stuff."
Michael,HR stuff? HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
Eric,"It's uh, it's a company evaluation form."
Michael,Ah.
Eric,"Talkin' bout, uh -"
Michael,"Talkin' bout, uh, what?"
Eric,Waste is next.
Michael,Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
Eric,"No, waste of time and resources."
Michael,"Oh, time and resources."
Toby,"Look, you know, in any company there's going to be certain degrees -"
Michael,"No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever."
Eric,Is anyone near retirement age?
Eric,"Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile."
Michael,This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. Right? Would you agree with that?
Toby,"Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about."
Michael,"That's, that is true."
Dwight,"Thank you, so much."
Kevin,Thank you.
Angela,Thank you.
Eric,Thank you. It's nice to meet you all.
Pam,Good to meet you.
Angela,Have a great day.
Dwight,Hope to see you soon.
Kevin,Yeah.
Michael,I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin?
Michael,I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
Computron,Computron experiencing emotion.
Michael,"Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?"
Computron,Ok.
Michael,Just - sh -
Computron,Please don't. Computron -
Michael,Shut -
Computron,wants to live.
Michael,Shut up. Shut up.
Michael,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'."
Dwight,"Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty."
Michael,So check out how we live
Both,in the Electric City!
Michael,They call it Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,"The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider."
Dwight,But check that it's covered by your
Both,Healthcare Provider!
Michael,Plenty of space in the parking lot.
Dwight,But the little cars go in the compact spot!
Both,Spot. Spot. Spot. Spot. Spot.
Michael,Snack attack time.
Dwight,Don't lose your head.
Michael,We like Cugino's
Both,for the tasty bread.
Michael,They call it Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
Dwight,What?
Michael,Ugh.
Michael,"Oh, yeah. I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?"
Angela,That's your toast?
Erin,"I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?"
Michael,No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
Oscar,I think you don't know what you're saying.
Phyllis,"Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud."
Michael,"It's from ""Sob-ray"", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me."
Michael,"Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good."
Michael,"Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses."
Kevin,Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Michael,"Oh! Wow. Awesome. For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you."
Michael,Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
Dwight,Here we go. Oh! Wow.
All,To us and to Sabre.
Michael,Cool. What next?
Michael,"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome."
Erin,"Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?"
Michael,"Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -"
David,"Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it."
Dwight,Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Teddy,Suck it!
Michael,"Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened..."
David,Yeah!
Dwight,Terrible mistake.
Teddy,Suck it!
Michael,And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
David,Yeah!
Dwight,Undistributable.
Teddy,Suck it!
Pam,"Well, maybe we can put the box back together."
David,Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
Dwight,Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Teddy,Suck it!
Oscar,I think we can do it.
David,Yeah!
Pam,"Yep, yep."
Teddy,Suck it!
Oscar,Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
David,Yeah!
Pam,Yep.
Both,Take out my Suck It and we'll suck it.
Oscar,"Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?"
David,Yeah! Teddy!
Pam,Yes.
Teddy,Yeah.
Creed,Have you tried making everything smaller?
Michael,"And - Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves."
Pam,"Oh, Michael."
Michael,"Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please."
Pam,"No, don't!"
Michael,Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Michael,"Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?"
Pam,What do you want us to do?
Michael,Why do I have to explain everything?
Pam,Because we're usually not on the same page.
Michael,Okay.
Gabe,Oh. Okay. And to you.
Michael,Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
Dwight,Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
Michael,"You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?"
Gabe,"Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions."
Michael,"Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert."
Jim,"Co-manager, actually."
Michael,In training.
Jim,Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
Gabe,We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
Michael,"We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?"
Dwight,So excited.
Michael,We have a little song prepared for you.
Gabe,"Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website."
Michael,Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
Dwight,Oh. Of course.
Michael,"Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys."
Andy,Ok.
Andy & Erin,"Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the ""Electric City"" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab -"
Michael,Saber.
Andy,"Saber. Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay."
Andy & Erin,"Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre."
Andy,You sure it's saber?
Pam,Hey.
Jim,"Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11"
Pam,"Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away."
Jim,"Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute."
Pam,We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
Jim,"Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird."
Pam,We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
Jim,"But if not, there's always the army. The infantry."
Pam,Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Christian Slater,"So you've just been bought by Sabre. You've probably got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm Christian Slater. What's it like to work for Sabre? Let's find out together. Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, but opening a window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At Sabre, you will."
Jo Bennett,You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you.
Jim,"So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, ""What's going on?"" Well, you're not alone."
Michael,Wow. Really terrific.
Gabe,"Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper."
Michael,Perfect.
Michael,No. Don't like that.
Gabe,"At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -"
Meredith,Talk about vacation days!
Gabe,"We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks."
Oscar,But I banked six weeks.
Angela,I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
Meredith,"Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?"
Gabe,"Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well."
Michael,"Mm, nope. Don't like that."
Gabe,"Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment."
Michael,"We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?"
Gabe,Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
Michael,I don't know what they're made of.
Dwight,They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
Gabe,"Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle."
Michael,"You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley."
Stanley,That's ok.
Michael,"There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -"
Michael,Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
Toby,Oop.
Michael,What?
Toby,Looks like we kicked it.
Michael,I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
Michael,I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
Gabe,"Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so..."
Michael,"Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em."
Gabe,Which ones?
Michael,All of them.
Gabe,"Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?"
Michael,So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
Gabe,You know what? Let me see what I can do.
Jim,"Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies."
Pam,There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
Jim,"Oh. Adorable, right? I walked in on someone in the bathroom."
Pam,What?
Jim,I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Pam,Who? The -
Jim,I don't know. I don't know.
Pam,The guy we're meeting with?
Jim,"I don't know, I don't know."
Andy,"I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here."
Erin,"Well, I saw them in there."
Andy,"Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, ""Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries."""
Erin,I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
Andy,The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
Gabe,"First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so..."
Jo,"Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now."
Gabe,"Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have really been proud of the way... Okay, um..."
Jo,"Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? I want to see who it is. Turn me around."
Gabe,I don't - it's just...
Jo,"Turn me around. Now. Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?"
Michael,Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
Jo,"Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you."
Michael,Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Jo,"Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?"
Michael,"Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -"
Jo,"Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things."
Michael,Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
Jo,"So listen, why don't you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes."
Michael,"I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help."
Jo,I would take until the end of the day if I were you.
Jerry,"Pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry."
Pam,Hi Jerry.
Jim,Jerry.
Jerry,Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.
Jim,"This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -"
Jerry,"Oh, so you saw it already?"
Jim,"No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular."
Pam,It's lovely.
Jerry,Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.
Jim,Do it.
Jerry,"Okay. Hi, this is Jerry."
Pam,"Ok, you've got to pull it together."
Jim,We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
Pam,He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
Jim,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
Pam,That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Jerry,Sorry about that. Right this way.
Jim,All right.
Michael,"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? Hey. Hi, sorry."
David,Michael.
Michael,I hope you're not busy doing something.
David,"No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on."
Michael,You sure?
David,You look great.
Michael,You look great too.
David,You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
Michael,"Oh, yeah, that sounds good."
David,"Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in."
Teddy Wallace,Huh? Hey.
Michael,Hey. Wow.
David,"Keep it up, son."
Michael,Really loud.
Michael,"Wow. Oh, yummy. You have got the life, my friend."
David,Yeah.
Michael,Can I just stay here and never go back?
David,Things not going so well there?
Michael,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?"
David,I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
Michael,Yeah.
Mrs. Wallace,"Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool?"
David,"Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out."
Mrs. Wallace,"Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything."
David,"No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael."
Michael,"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see..."
Mrs. Wallace,No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?
Michael,I don't know.
David,"Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. Outside."
Jim,"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit."
Jerry,"That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans."
Jim,"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes."
Jerry,"Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it."
Pam,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
Jim,What?
Jerry,Seriously? You told her?
Jim,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
Jerry,And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?
Jim,No.
Pam,"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well."
Jerry,"Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?"
Pam,Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
Jerry,I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?
Jim,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?"
Jerry,It doesn't lock for the children's safety.
Jim,Anybody could have walked in.
Jerry,It was story time.
Michael,"Sabre is changing everything. Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?"
David,"I don't know. I mean, what can you do?"
Michael,Exactly. What are you thinking?
David,"I, I - It's a tough one."
Michael,It is a tough one.
David,I don't have any ideas for you there.
Michael,Yeah. But one would be good.
David,"Hey, oh, okay. Wait."
Michael,Okay.
David,I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
Michael,Okay.
David,"Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. Picks it up!"
Michael,So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
David,"No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise."
Michael,"Oh, okay."
David,You-you don't like it.
Michael,"No, I think it is-"
David,"No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. Did I say that?"
Michael,Yep.
David,It'll be ok.
Andy,"Hey, any fun weekend plans?"
Erin,"No, you?"
Andy,"Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?"
Erin,Nothing. It's wide open.
Andy,Okay.
Andy,That's as hard as I can hint.
David,"Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again."
Michael,The what?
David,Suck it. That's what it's called.
Michael,"Oh, okay."
David,Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
Michael,Like it.
Michael,There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
Michael,See you later.
David,"Oh, Michael."
Michael,Bye now.
David,Thank you for coming.
Michael,Thanks for having me.
Michael,"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here."
Michael,"Hello. Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go."
Michael,You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
Michael,"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches."
Everyone,"Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot."
Michael,But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
Hotel Employee,"Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you?"
Kelly,"Bye, Andy."
Michael,"Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics."
Andy,...That was weird.
Hotel Employee,"Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here..."
Meredith,No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Michael,Okey doke.
Andy,I don't even know what that card said.
Hotel Employee,"Um, I don't seem to have it, sir."
Meredith,"Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now."
Michael,What?
Michael,Hey.
Dwight,"I'm not seeing anything under ""confirmation."""
Jim,Hey.
Michael,No.
Michael,"You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here."
Dwight,"Could it be under ""affirmation?"" Cause you have thousands of those."
Jim,"Well, the grass is always greener."
Michael,No. We're trying to look it up right now.
Michael,Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
Dwight,You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
Jim,"Well, it's what you wanted."
Michael,"Um, come on."
Michael,I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
Dwight,Michael...
Jim,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do."
Hotel Employee,"Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months."
Michael,"We make a poster that says ""Happy Opposite Day!"" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black."
Michael,"Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation."
Jim,"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her."
Dwight,"Wait, I got it! Confirmation code"
Michael,Lethal Weapon?
Hotel Employee,"...Oh, here it is. Yep."
Jim,That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Michael,Oh.
Jo,"You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?"
Dwight,Thank you.
Michael,What? What I'm saying...
Hotel Employee,Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?
Jim,"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly."
Michael,That's it!
Michael,"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? See? They love me."
Hotel Employee,"Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize."
Jo,"Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it."
Michael and Dwight,"Uh-huh, okay..."
Jim,Alright.
Hotel Employee,"Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?"
Michael,Alright!
Michael,"Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please."
Jo,"Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em."
Hotel Employee,"There is a cancellation fee for this, sir."
Andy,"Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message"
Michael,"Okay, put it on my card."
Phyllis,You don't even like us as friends?
Michael,"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?"
Andy,"Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you."
Michael,Why hello!
Oscar,"What are we, five?"
Gabe,"This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch."
Andy,"""Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog."""
Michael,"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett."
Kelly,"Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?"
Jo,"Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the ""Mrs."" just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place."
Andy,It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
Andy,These sure are pretty dogs...
Kelly,Who?
Jo,They love a good crotch.
Andy,"It's not... Whether or not, you..."
Andy,They sure do.
Kelly,"Who, what?"
Jo,You should take that as a compliment!
Erin,"Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?"
Andy,"Oh, I do!"
Michael,"Oh, it smells good in here."
Jo,Hello.
Erin,"Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator."
Dwight,Hello.
Michael,"Erin, what about my keyboard? Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?"
Jo,Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?
Erin,Oh!
Dwight,"I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy."
Pam,He looks happy.
Jo,I like that.
Jim,Yep.
Gabe,This is Accounting.
Dwight,"Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he what? Michael!"
Kevin,Hi!
Dwight,I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
Jo,Good-looking group.
Ryan,"Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel."
Gabe,Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
Dwight,"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?"
Jo,Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?
Ryan,I would love to. Why not?
Gabe,"That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office."
Dwight,Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Jo,I thought this guy was the manager?
Ryan,"Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know."
Gabe,"Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager."
Dwight,"It is not ""farm boy swill,"" I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious."
Jo,Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!
Ryan,I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
Andy,Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
Angela,"No, no!"
Kevin,"What, no candy?"
Andy,"Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem ""too eager,"" so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit."
Andy,
Meredith,"Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!"
Meredith,"Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat."
Michael,"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job."
Jim,"Whoa, whoa."
Michael,"Whoa, whoa!"
Jim,"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here"
Jo,Yeah. I think I understand.
Jim,Alright.
Jo,Each of you is doing half a job.
Jim,No.
Michael,And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
Jo,"This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?"
Jim,I don't think so.
Jo,Michael?
Michael,Forget the question...
Jo,"I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager."
Michael,I humbly accept the management position.
Jim,I... Why would you just say something like that?
Michael,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk"
Jim,Do you even know what that means?
Michael,Yes.
Jo,"Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go."
Jim,Um...
Jo,You can go on. Shoo!
Jo,"I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you."
Andy,"Whoa-oh, traffic jam!"
Erin,"Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!"
Andy,Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
Erin,Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
Andy,"There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card."
Erin,"Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!"
Andy,"Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock."
Erin,You named them?
Andy,"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?"
Erin,"Uh, yeah I do remember. Aw, they love each other."
Andy,"Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed."
Erin,"Wow, it smells really good too."
Andy,"Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there."
Erin,"Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!"
Andy,It's got pheromones in it.
Jo,Hey!
Kevin,Hi.
Jo,"Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!"
Kevin,"Jo, there's books in my chair."
Jo,"That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?"
Michael,"No, we know. Texas!"
Jo,"Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers."
Michael,I could manage my way around that.
Jo,They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market.
Michael,I will try to manage my excitement!
Michael,"I have been saying the word ""manager"" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks ""manager"" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a pen1s. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a pen1s. And vise-versa."
Jo,I think that's it. So we're all good! Thanks ya'll.
Dwight,"I, uh..."
Kelly,Oh my God.
Kelly,"I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual."
Pam,"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year."
Jim,This is way more than I make now.
Jim,"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women."
Jim,"Hey, you got a second?"
Michael,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
Jim,"Actually, yeah."
Michael,What?
Jim,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Michael,What? Really?
Jim,Yeah!
Michael,Wow!
Michael,"La la la, hello Oscar!"
Oscar,Michael. Reading.
Michael,What are you reading?
Oscar,The Atlantic.
Michael,"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again."
Oscar,I should step into sales myself.
Michael,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?"
Oscar,Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Michael,...Where did you get that information.
Oscar,Manual.
Michael,Manuel who?
Michael,"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled."
Michael,Son of a bitch. Pardon me.
Jo,"Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!"
Michael,Okay.
Jo,Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.
Michael,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales."
Jo,Really?
Jim,Really.
Michael,"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman."
Jo,"Well, I think you're both being a little too modest."
Jim,"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons."
Michael,"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people."
Jim,Why would you do that?
Michael,I'm turning myself in right now!
Jo,"You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment."
Michael,Thank you.
Jo,"I think you will become the salesman, and congratulations! You're gonna be the new manager of this branch!"
Michael,"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss."
Pam,"Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!"
Jim,Mm!
Dwight,"Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. 89... 88..."
Dwight,You're twenty minutes late!
Ryan,"Um, I was at another dumpster!"
Dwight,Just admit you lost track of time.
Dwight,Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
Ryan,Did you see Saw?
Dwight,Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
Ryan,"No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?"
Dwight,"Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw."
Ryan,"Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment."
Dwight,I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Ryan,Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Dwight,I have an old barn!
Ryan,Yes!
Dwight,"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?"
Ryan,"We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask..."
Dwight,"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!"
Ryan,Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
Dwight,He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Ryan,Don't just criticize my idea!
Dwight,Think!
Ryan,You think of something then!
Erin,"Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk."
Michael,How is that possible?
Erin,"Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space."
Michael,"No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen."
Erin,"You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager."
Michael,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? Michael Scott, head of sales."
Jim,"You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there."
Dwight,The new IT guy. Nick.
Ryan,Nick.
Dwight,"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it."
Ryan,Like Frodo!
Dwight,"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?"
Ryan,"Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum."
Dwight,Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
Dwight,I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Erin,Who's hungry?
Jim,What is that?
Erin,It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2
Jim,"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though."
Erin,Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Jim,Why would I wanna do that?
Erin,"It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain."
Jim,"For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here..."
Erin,Oh sure.
Jim,Yeah. Thank you.
Erin,Well.
Michael,"It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called ""Curves."" I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!"
Kevin,Nice!
Dwight,"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much."
Michael,Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
Dwight,It's not really 1992 anymore.
Michael,"Well, okay..."
Kelly,"You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me."
Erin,Geez louise.
Kelly,"I know, obsessed with me much?"
Erin,"Well, everyone got one."
Kelly,What did yours say?
Erin,Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Erin,"It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all."
Dwight,"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room."
Nick,"Uh, yep."
Dwight,"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords."
Nick,"No, I actually don't."
Dwight,"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him."
Nick,I think that you should call the cops.
Dwight,"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer."
Nick,"I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that."
Ryan,"Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you."
Nick,Are you... you threatening me?
Ryan,Threatening you? No.
Michael,What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
Pam,"Michael, stop."
Michael,"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?"
Pam,Michael...
Michael,"You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps."
Dwight,"Michael, it's Phyllis."
Michael,"No, this is geological."
Phyllis,I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Michael,Are you kidding me?
Phyllis,No.
Michael,And you guys are okay with this?
Dwight,"She sent an email, so."
Phyllis,I did.
Andy,It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
Michael,Oh my God.
Kelly,Oh! You scared me!
Andy,"I'm sorry, I thought you saw me."
Kelly,"I didn't see you. And you were there all along. Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go."
Andy,"Cool, thanks."
Pam,"I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks."
Michael,Alright.
Clark,"Yes, congratulations."
Dwight,Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Dwight,Let's go!
Jim,Thank you.
Jim,"Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely."
Michael,"Geesh, Dwight!"
Clark,"Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?"
Dwight,"No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!"
Dwight,Michael!
Pam,Okay.
Pam,There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
Michael,What!?
Jim,Please do.
Dwight,"Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay."
Dwight,This is where I saw that deer last week.
Pam,"Oh, shoot."
Dwight,"I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd."
Michael,Where?
Jim,What?
Pam,"Kevin, you're such a gourmand."
Dwight,Right over by that fence.
Pam,"Shoot, she fell off."
Kevin,"I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken."
Michael,By the bushes?
Jim,"Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing."
Pam,Hmm.
Jim,"Okay, Michael! Focus!"
Pam,"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?"
Kevin,"Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner."
Michael,"Okay, go, go, go, go!"
Jim,No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.
Kevin,I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
Dwight,Let's go!
Pam,"Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it."
Pam,"Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?"
Dwight,"I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends."
Jim,"Okay, I'll just go get the other guy."
Kevin,I think it should be a surprise.
Jim,"Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon."
Dwight,"Hey, what's up, kid?"
Meredith,"Oh, getting there, huh?"
Michael,"Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised."
Angela,Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
Pam,"No, no. I still have time."
Pam,Michael!
Dwight,"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?"
Pam,"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor."
Michael,Yeah?
Angela,I look forward to it.
Jim,"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO."
Pam,"Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on."
Dwight,Very well.
Pam,"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors."
Jim,"Michael, come on!"
Angela,Goodbye.
Jim,"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy."
Michael,"I'm texting about you, okay!?"
Pam,"Jim, Jim, get her."
Pam,I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Dwight,"Ugh, alright. Let's move! ... What?"
Jim,Hmm?
Pam,Ooh.
Policeman,Pull over!
Pam,Get the baby. Get her. Come on.
Michael,"Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car..."
Dwight,Are you kidding me?
Jim,Okay. Sshh. I know.
Jim,Michael.
Policeman,"Pull over! You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight!"
Pam,I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.
Michael,"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money."
Pam,"Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!"
Jim,That's amazing.
Jim,"Michael, you shouldn't have done that."
Jim,Okay.
Pam,"Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the ""C thing."""
Michael,"Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office."
Pam,It has the birth song on it!
Jim,That's awesome.
Pam,"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?"
Jim,"Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine."
Pam,"Aw, we're doing it."
Michael,"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too."
Pam,"Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack."
Jim,that's great.
Jim,"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty."
Jim,"Okay, so what do you want to do?"
Pam,We're really parents now.
Michael,"Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!"
Pam,I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Pam,"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight."
Jim,"Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now."
Michael,Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.
Erin,"Ooh, spooky. But why?"
Michael,"Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready?"
Erin,Hey.
Jim,Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Dwight,Dwight Schrute.
Kevin,Hi.
Pam,Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.
Michael,"Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday."
Erin,I have really enjoyed our time together.
Nick,"Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music."
Dwight,Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Kevin,"Yeah, me too."
Michael,"Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd."
Michael,Okay.
Erin,I want to continue working on our friendship.
Angela,What are you looking at?
Pam,Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...
Kevin,"Really, really fun."
Dwight,"Ha, nerd."
Dwight,I don't need a key.
Erin,Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Kelly,"Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself."
Pam,"Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the..."
Kevin,"Yeah, me too."
Dwight,Bare my child.
Dwight,"No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala."
Erin,"And, you're my friend."
Angela,Excuse me?
Pam,Dwight just listen! It's underneath...
Kevin,Yeah.
Dwight,"I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4"
Michael,Okay.
Erin,"And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe..."
Jim,That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.
Jim,"Wait, you alright?"
Kevin,Yeah.
Pam,"Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet."
Pam,Yes.
Michael,"Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?"
Jim,Are you serious? Pam.
Michael,"Do you have everything, guys?"
Kevin,You said she liked me.
Pam,"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes."
Jim,"Michael, just go park the car."
Michael,"Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place."
Jim,"I... Pam, please."
Michael,"Okay, alright."
Kevin,I've dumped better than Erin.
Pam,"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight."
Hospital employee,Sir! You can't park here!
Michael,No.
Andy,"Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate."
Michael,Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. I just did.
Kevin,"Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael."
Pam,Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.
Michael,Lynn was as hot as Erin.
Jim,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart."
Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you."
Pam,Five minutes apart.
Michael,"This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?"
Jim,"So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant."
Jim,"Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good."
Andy,Ow.
Pam,"Okay, stop watching me."
Nurse,Daddy? She's ready to push.
Michael,Kev... Nice. Going.
Jim,"Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers."
Jim,Okay.
Erin,Well...
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Michael,"Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go."
Isabelle,Knock knock.
Jim,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?"
Jim,"Doing great, push again."
Pam,"Oh, hey, Isabelle."
Pam,Not until midnight.
Doctor,Not yet.
Jim,Hey.
Andy,"Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds."
Jim,"No, don't push. Pull. Pull."
Isabelle,"Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her?"
Erin,I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Nurse,Why don't you get more ice chips?
Pam,"Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!"
Andy,"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book."
Pam,"No, Jim, stay!"
Jim,What?
Jim,"You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet."
Doctor,"Okay. Really push this time, Pam."
Pam,Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.
Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore."
Pam,Okay.
Jim,"Okay, okay."
Jim,"Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals."
Michael,"Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes."
Pam,"Oh, my gosh."
Pam,"Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it."
Michael,That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
Kathy,"Oh,has she been fussing long?"
Michael,"Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!"
Andy,"Hey, have you guys seen her?"
Pam,"No, not at all."
Michael,"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
Meredith,She hasn't popped yet.
Jim,Perfect.
Michael,The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
Andy,What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.
Kathy,"I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry..."
Andy,Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
Andy,"I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper."
Nurse,How's it going?
Michael,I will allow that.
Phyllis,This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.
Pam,"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di..."
Andy,Yes! Can anyone do those?
Michael,I think it's going to be any minute now.
Jim,Ha ha ha.
Stanley,I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Phyllis,"But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour."
Nurse,Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?
Jim,"Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one."
Michael,"Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?"
Jim,We definitely are. At 3
Pam,"Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking."
Phyllis,I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Nurse,"Yeah, you can. It's 2"
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright."
Jim,Half hour.
Kelly,"Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior."
Michael,"Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna..."
Nurse,Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat?
Pam,"Oh, thanks, Kelly."
Pam,This is happening!
Jim,"Yes, car seat's right there."
Michael,"Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?"
Michael,"You're starting, you're kinda losing them."
Nurse,That bottom part needs to go in the car.
Pam,"Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request."
Jim,"Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God."
Jim,"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car."
Michael,"Yes, Phyl?"
Pam,"Oh, my God."
Nurse,"Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes."
Phyllis,I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Michael,"Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?"
Jim,"Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me."
Michael,"Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that."
Doctor,"Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out."
Isabelle,"Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here?"
Andy,I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
Michael,Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Dwight,"Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so..."
Michael,"That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay."
Pam,She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Isabelle,"Wow, ha. New cabinets."
Andy,"Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance."
Jim,"No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each."
Dwight,Yup.
Ryan,"""You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."""
Pam,Okay.
Isabelle,All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge?
Erin,Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
Michael,"Guys, guys!"
Dwight,"Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this."
Angela,Good afternoon.
Jim,Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Isabelle,"Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it."
Dwight,Have a seat.
Michael,Eleven pounds...
Dwight,"Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun."
Angela,What is this?
Jim,"She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great."
Isabelle,"Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too."
Dwight,"Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract."
Everyone,Yeah!
Dwight,"Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha."
Angela,Of course.
Michael,Thank you! Thank you!
Isabelle,Yeah...
Dwight,It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Oscar,Congratulations. That's great.
Dwight,"Alright. I'll call you, kid."
Angela,You know I was thinking...
(Pam's mom) Heleen,Hi there.
Isabelle,Do that.
Dwight,"Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one"
Jim,"Hey, grandma's back."
Jim,Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Angela,Agreed.
Helene,"Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee."
Hospital employee,Yeah.
Michael,"Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there."
Jim,Great.
Jim,"But you hear the baby crying, right?"
Kevin,"For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!"
Pam,"Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months."
Hospital employee,Mm-hmm... Where's your car?
Jim,"Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know..."
Helene,"Ooh, somebody has a full diaper."
Jim,"Uh, it's in the lot."
Pam,"Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times."
Jim,Oh. Let me get it.
Hospital employee,"Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around."
Michael,"Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times."
Jim,I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.
Jim,"Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back."
Jim,Alright.
Michael,"Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma."
Pam,"Okay, please hurry."
Michael,"Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one."
Helene,"Hello, Michael."
Andy,"Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation."
Erin,"Um, stimulate the nipples."
Michael,"Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you."
Erin,"Okay, good."
Michael,"Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle."
Helene,"I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go."
Andy,"The fax says ""Erin, will you have dinner with me?"" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number."
Kevin,Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Pam,Okay.
Erin,"It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?"
Meredith,I have a shirt like that in my car.
Helene,Love you.
Andy,"Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired."
Michael,"Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?"
Michael,"Love you, as a friend."
Erin,You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.
Erin,"Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods."
Pam,"Love you, mom."
Andy,"Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax."
Michael,"Okay, the opposite of that?"
Michael,"Ooh, I want to hold the baby!"
Erin,You read the fax.
Kevin,Stick spicy food up her butt.
Pam,"Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first."
Andy,I'm... I'm asking you out.
Jim,"Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now."
Michael,Alright.
Erin,"Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner."
Pam,"Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions."
Pam,"Again, no pants."
Andy,"So, it's a date."
Jim,"Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry."
Michael,"Oh, okay."
Erin,Yes. Do you have a day in mind?
Pam,Why don't you go do some work?
Jim,Ready?
Andy,"Yeah, what day? What day?"
Jim,"Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled."
Michael,"Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael."
Erin,Everyday is fine. Or...
Pam,"I know, you don't like to be frazzled."
Jim,"It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here."
Andy,"Well, that, what's that one?"
Jim,"No, I don't."
Dwight,"Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work."
Erin,Thursday?
Pam,Okay.
Michael,"There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family."
Andy,Okay. Let's do it.
Jim,"Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally."
Andy,This man has a gift!
Erin,Okay.
Michael,"Ooh, someone's freakin'."
Michael,Who else here is single?
Hospital employee,Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
Andy,A little frazzled.
Kelly,I'm not single. I have a man.
Pam,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Michael,I think he is.
Michael,"I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too."
Hospital employee,"Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today."
Jim,"I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes."
Stanley,Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Pam,"Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it."
Dwight,Acceptable names include and are limited to
Michael,"Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? Who else? Come on! People, I know models!"
Jim,Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.
Angela,Jedediah.
Ryan,"Ha ha, plus size models, maybe."
Pam,Hi. We did it.
Dwight,Jonas.
Michael,"Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single."
Jim,"You used my move, didn't you?"
Angela,Jedediah.
Meredith,You know it. I am never getting married.
Pam,I used a variation of your move.
Dwight,Warf.
Meredith,Like Clooney.
Michael,"There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick..."
Angela,No Star Trek names.
Michael,"Andrew, what about you?"
Dwight,"Two forms of ID, please."
Dwight,Okay. Fine.
Andy,"Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing."
Angela,"And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it?"
Angela,What if it's a girl?
Andy,"Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible."
Dwight,Nothing.
Dwight,"Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male."
Michael,"Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love."
Angela,Alright. How would you like to celebrate?
Angela,Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.
Pam,Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Dwight,Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.
Dwight,Yes you can.
Jim,We were just kids. What did we know?
Angela,No.
Nurse,How we doing?
Dwight,"It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months."
Jim,Great.
Angela,Absolutely not.
Pam,Good.
Jim,Hey.
Nurse,Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
Pam,"Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital."
Pam,Doesn't she sleep here?
Jim,"Ah, you know me too well."
Nurse,She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.
Pam,"Okay, Jim."
Jim,I think we'll be okay.
Jim,Yeah? ... Oh.
Nurse,"Okay, great."
Pam,"Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?"
Pam,"Oh, big yawn."
Jim,"Did you say ""she?"""
Jim,"Ready? One, two, three..."
Pam,"I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad."
Pam,"One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down."
Jim,Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.
Jim,"I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it."
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Pam,She's not gonna... Just...
Jim,"Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man."
Jim,I got it. Alright.
Pam,I know.
Pam,Go.
Jim,"Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better."
Jim,Nurse!
Pam,Good.
Jim,How you doing?
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,"I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything."
Pam,Okay.
Jim,Really?
Jim,"Alright... Hey, did you change?"
Pam,Doesn't feel right.
Pam,"Oh, yeah, my water broke."
Jim,"Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?"
Jim,Oh. Oh...
Pam,How does one do that?
Pam,"Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow."
Jim,Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.
Michael,"Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?"
Pam,"Do you want to try it, Jim?"
Phyllis,"No, it's 4"
Jim,I think you're good. Doing a good job.
Michael,4
Nurse,Somebody buzzed?
Pam,"No, not yet, Michael."
Jim,"Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam."
Michael,We can do...
Pam,I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.
Pam,"Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?"
Nurse,"Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later."
Michael,Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
Pam,Even if she's not getting anything?
Oscar,That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Nurse,"Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery."
Michael,What is October feast?
Pam,No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Pam,"There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there."
Nurse,"Oh, good. You know everything."
Kevin,Our ultra feast menu's theme
Pam,"She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up."
Pam,"Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it."
Nurse,"Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?"
Michael,"Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital."
Jim,Alright.
Jim,Alright. Time to go. Okay.
Nurse,Alright.
Michael,"That's right, let's do this."
Jim,It's going to be alright.
Jim,Let's give it a shot.
Pam,Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Pam,"Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine."
Jim,"Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good."
Jim,"Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital."
Erin,You wanted to see me?
Pam,"They're not that bad still, babe."
Michael,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?"
Jim,"Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital."
Erin,"Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?"
Pam,"No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay."
Kevin,Ta-da!
Jim,"Come on, Michael says we should go now."
Michael,I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Michael,"Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out."
Kevin,Yes!
Pam,"No, it's passing, it's fine."
Erin,I don't know what to say.
Jim,Pam.
Kevin,"Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me."
Pam,"Ah, no, it passed. It's good."
Michael,"Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?"
Jim,You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.
Kevin,"Erin, would you have lunch with me?"
Pam,"Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it."
Erin,Okay.
Jim,"Hey, are you kidding me?"
Michael,Good!
Michael,Are you kidding?
Kevin,Yes!
Jim,"If anyone can do this, you can do this."
Erin,"Michael, could I talk to you privately?"
Michael,You can do this. You can do this.
Michael,"Sure. Kevin, please leave."
Jim,"Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared."
Kevin,Bye.
Michael,"I'm scared, too."
Michael,Bye.
Kevin,I'm petrified.
Erin,"I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy."
Jim,"The best news is, we're going to have a baby today."
Michael,Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
Michael,Yeah.
Erin,I'm sure he'll be fine.
Jim,A really awesome baby.
Michael,"I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah."
Michael,We're going to have a baby.
Erin,Really?
Jim,So let's have it at the hospital.
Michael,"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though."
Michael,Let's do that.
Erin,I don't want anyone to die.
Jim,How are we doing on contractions?
Michael,Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
Michael,Two minutes apart.
Kevin,Hi.
Jim,Two minutes...
Erin,Hi.
Pam,"Oh, God. Oh, no."
Kevin,She touched my shoulder.
Jim,"Michael, I told you."
Nurse,"Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy."
Michael,It's okay.
Jim,"Oh, hi."
Jim,"No, I told you to warn me at five minutes."
Kathy,Hi.
Pam,"Jim, we waited too long!"
Dale,"Hi, so sorry."
Michael,"I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon."
Jim,"Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there."
Jim,"We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?"
Pam,I know.
Michael,"We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?"
Jim,You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.
Pam,I don't want to have my baby here.
Michael,You're not going to. You know where you're going?
Erin,Did you grow up around here?
Pam,The hospital.
Kevin,No.
Michael,"Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?"
Erin,"So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?"
Pam,A baby.
Kevin,Yes.
Michael,Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Andy,"Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like ""Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,"" or, ""What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?"" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, ""Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted."" ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous."
Michael,"I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!"
Hospital employee,"Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?"
Dwight,"No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops."
Pam,Yes?
Jim,"Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually."
Hospital employee,Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
Michael,"No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it."
Pam,"Um, yeah, that would be great."
Jim,"Alright, I have my wallet."
Jim,Yup. Really great. When's she available?
Michael,Yes.
Clark,"Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with."
Jim,"Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys?"
Pam,"So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch..."
Michael,Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
Clark,I'll get that for you.
Erin,There's nothing in it.
Pam,"Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything."
Michael,"You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?"
Clark,Okay. Let me feel here.
Oscar,"The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!"
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!
Clark,"Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand."
Pam,"Dwight, get away!"
Pam,Okay.
Michael,"No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please."
Clark,"When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt?"
Erin,I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Pam,"No, I mean, it feels... pressure."
Dwight,"""We"" don't."
Clark,Okay.
Jim,"Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here."
Jim,Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
"Dwight, Jim and Michael",Here we go!
Pam,No. It just feels like pressure.
Phyllis,Good luck!
Clark,"Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that?"
Nick,"Good luck, Pam!"
Jim,Yup.
Michael,Thank you! Wish me luck!
Clark,Stimulate it.
Creed,Have fun!
Jim,Yeah.
Meredith,"Hey, it's 5"
Clark,"Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh..."
Michael,Here we go! Here we go! On our way!
Jim,Perfect.
Stanley,Hold it!
Clark,And you can just... The baby should grab on to that.
Michael,"Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!"
Jim,I think she will.
Toby,"Oh, one more!"
Pam,"Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if..."
Michael,"No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot."
Jim,We'll figure it out.
Michael,"Dwight, what is the traffic like?"
Clark,It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.
Dwight,Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!
Pam,"Okay. Aw, thank you."
Michael,Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
Gabe,You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
Kelly,"I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?"
Michael,Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
Ryan,"Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups."
Gabe,"Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead!"
Kelly,Well why don't you invite your friends?
Michael,"Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing."
Ryan,Why are you being so weird about this?
Michael,Hello Jo.
Meredith,"Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids."
Jo,Anything I can do for you Puddin'?
Ryan,Why no kids?
Michael,"There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8"
Kelly,"Yeah, where are your kids?"
Jo,Hmm.
Meredith,Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
Michael,"I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around."
Michael,"It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas."
Jo,All right then.
Erin,"Welcome back, ""Dad!"""
Michael,"Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship."
Jim,"Oh, thank you!"
Jo,Michael?
Phyllis,Hey!
Michael,Yes.
Stanley,Hey!
Jo,I look forward to that too.
Andy,Welcome back Tuna!
Andy,Ooh. It's coming down out there.
Jim,Hey...
Erin,"Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here."
Dwight,"Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks."
Andy,"No, I-"
Jim,What do we got here?
Erin,I'm so sorry I was so sick.
Dwight,Mega-Desk.
Andy,"Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick."
Jim,Of course.
Michael,"Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!"
Dwight,Command central.
"Meredith, Creed, Oscar and Matt",
Jim,Hm hm.
Michael,Drinks are on me!
Dwight,"Surveillance, gaming- and business."
Oscar,"No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!"
Jim,Okay. Just gotta...
Michael,Oh -hoh! All right.
Dwight,Okay. Come on! Jim!
Michael,"Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something"
Dwight,"Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk."
Todd Packer,Whoops!
Jo,"Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling!"
Michael,"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. What the hell is going on back there?"
Jim,Morning!
Jim,Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. Thank you.
Jo,"Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something."
Dwight,What the hell is this?
Jo,Oh good morning sweetheart.
Jim,Oh!
Michael,"Morning, honey-pile."
Dwight,This is not Mega-Desk.
Jo,I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
Jim,"No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk."
Michael,It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
Dwight,"That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks."
Jo,Is that a lump of coal?
Jim,Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?
Michael,Yes it is!
Dwight,"Hello, Dwight Schrute?"
Jo,Have I been that naughty?
Michael,"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal."
Jo,"Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted."
Michael,"Mm, that sounds great, actually."
Jo,"Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay."
Michael,"When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!"
Andy,Erin go braugh!
Erin,Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!
Andy,Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
Andy,"Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to ""How I Met Your Mother"" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them."
Jim,No.
Dwight,Great.
Jim,No.
Dwight,Thank you.
Jim,No-no-no-no-no.
Dwight,Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Jim,Is this yours or mine?
Dwight,They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Jim,Good Lord! I can't believe I'm missing this.
Pam,"It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic."
Jim,Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.
Dwight,"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?"
Jim,It is. Big time.
Dwight,"Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now."
Jim,Pretty amazing.
Dwight,"What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on."
Jim,Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Dwight,"I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father."
Jim,Is that what happened to you?
Dwight,"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother."
Jim,That's a common mistake.
Dwight,"Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending."
Angela,Hey! Are you sick?
Erin,"Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion."
Angela,In your nose?
Erin,Yes.
Erin,"I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six."
Jo,"Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like."
Michael,That is a great idea JB.
Jo,"Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist."
Kevin,"Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap."
Jo,You know it doesn't have to be an invention.
Oscar,I have a question.
Michael,"Oscar, homosexual accountant."
Oscar,"In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?"
Jo,"I am so proud of Sabre's ""Print In All Colors"" initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. Daryl?"
Michael,"Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse..."
Jo,Okay hush now.
Michael,Okay.
Daryl,"The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in."
Jo,But you wouldn't need more trucks?
Daryl,Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
Jo,Oh look at you.
Michael,"Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen."
Jo,I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?
Daryl,Are you serious?
Jo,Yeah. Take Jim's old office.
Gabe,Um. I set my stuff up in there. So... just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Jo,"Yeah, I want to hear more from you."
Daryl,Absolutely.
Jo,All right.
Daryl,Thank you.
Jo,"Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!"
Michael,"Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!"
Jo,"Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away."
Michael,"Well, I am heading down there."
Jo,"Well, anytime now."
Michael,How about July 4th weekend?
Jo,Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?
Michael,I did!
Jo,"Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?"
Michael,"You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -"
Jo,Enough!
Michael,"All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on."
Michael,Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Daryl,"Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky..."
Michael,"Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch."
Jo,"No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set."
Michael,No is not an option.
Jo,Yes it is.
Michael,"All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no."
Jo,How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
Michael,I'll be over there.
Jim,And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
Dwight,"Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you."
Jim,What?
Dwight,My headphones are broken.
Jim,Right.
Dwight,Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Jim,Yeah that's great. Great.
Dwight,"Okay? ""The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"""
Jim,When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
D,"""- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-"""
Jim,Please stop that!
Dwight,"""-But we'll be together then-"""
Jim,Can you grow up?
Dwight,"""-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then."""
Jim,Whether it's this time or next time.
Andy,"""The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon"""
Jim,Yeah.
Andy and Dwight,"""Little boy blue and the man in the moon."""
Jim,"No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--"
Andy and Dwight,"""When you coming home Dad?"
Jim,"You know, can I call you back?"
Andy and Dwight,"""I don't know when-"""
Jim,"That would be great, thank you."
Andy and Dwight,"""But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-"""
Jim,"No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home."
Jim,I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Erin,This fax came for you.
Jo,Oh no no no! Are you feeling ill?
Erin,Uh...
Jo,"Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week."
Erin,Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Jo,"Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?"
Erin,Well...
Andy,She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
Jo,Yes?
Andy,I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.
Jo,Oh! You're sick! Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home.
Andy,"No, no, no, no, no."
Jo,Get everybody sick in the office.
Andy,I have some good ideas...
Jo,We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now.
Andy,You sure?
Jo,You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Michael,Very nice.
Daryl,"Not bad, huh?"
Michael,"A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?"
Daryl,I impressed her with my good ideas.
Michael,"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?"
Daryl,I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
Michael,"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?"
Daryl,"Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television."
Michael,Okay. All right.
Jo,Hey there.
Michael,Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
Jo,Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.
Michael,"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so."
Jo,"Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work..."
Michael,Right. What?
Jo,"Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home."
Michael,Mm. mm. Oh well.
Jo,Anything else I can help you with?
Michael,"No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope."
Kevin,"Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous."
Michael,Hey Pack-man.
Todd Packer,"Hey what's up, Butt-plug?"
Michael,How you doing stud? You already there?
Todd Packer,"Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice."
Michael,How's the lady situation?
Todd Packer,Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
Michael,"Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late."
Todd Packer,"Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!"
Michael,Yeah. Maybe next year.
Todd Packer,"Maybe next ""queer."" Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?"
Erin,Oh! Andy!
Andy,Hi!
Erin,I'm in my jammy-jams!
Andy,"That's okay, I'm in my ""worky-works."" You look amazing!"
Erin,"Oh, thanks. Come in!"
Meredith,Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Kevin,Oh I'm in.
Oscar,I'm in.
Meredith,All right.
Jo,"Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!"
Dwight,"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working."
Dwight,"Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening I have..."
Jo,Hello?
Jim,"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7"
Jo,"Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers."
Jim,"You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!"
Jo,Okay.
Jim,Okay.
Jo,Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?
Dwight,"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week."
Jo,Thank you.
Jim,Thanks again by the way.
Daryl,Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
Warehouse guy 1,We're here to bust you out!
Daryl,"I wish, but uh-"
Warehouse guy 1,Dude! Your shirt tucked in?
Daryl,"Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom. All right then, uh, let me get to it."
Warehouse guy 1,All right.
Warehouse guy 2,See you later.
Erin,Your hand's cold.
Andy,It is? I'm sorry.
Erin,"Yeah, have some more blanket."
Andy,"Okay, thanks."
Reid,What's up?
Andy,Whoa!
Erin,"You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid."
Andy,I didn't know you had a brother.
Erin,He's my foster brother.
Andy,"Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard."
Reid,Cold hands.
Andy,"Are we rotating seats, or?"
Reid,"Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet."
Erin,"Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them!"
Reid,Ooh!
Andy,"So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?"
Erin,None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Andy,All right. Formative years.
Reid,Nice skirt.
Andy,"Yeah, it's a kilt."
Night cleaning crew,"Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry."
Angela,"Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day."
Jo,Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
Michael,How late do we have to work tonight?
Michael,"Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. Do you know who that is?"
Jim,"Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it."
Jim,No.
Phyllis,"Okay, fine. Cash it is."
Michael,"Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans..."
Andy,"Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches""."
Jim,Is he you?
Michael,"Okay, Dwight. Here we go oh god."
Michael,I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
Dwight,Oh
Jim,Where did you take that?
Michael,"We're never going to find those leads, are we?"
Michael,In my condo complex.
Dwight,"Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this."
Jim,"Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton."
Phyllis,"So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -"
Michael,"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie."
Jim,"No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay Hey everybody!"
Jim,Sure. That they should do one.
Meredith,Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Michael,"Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?"
Jim,"No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is"
Jim,Who's that?
Andy,Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Michael,"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim."
Phyllis,"Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So..."
Jim,John Dillinger.
Oscar,"Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move."
Michael,No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Kevin,"Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell."
Jim,Captain Crunch.
Angela,Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Michael,"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?"
Jim,Yes! We do. Eclairs.
Jim,At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Stanley,"Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -"
Michael,"Yeah. Well, it wasn't him."
Jim,#NAME?
Jim,"I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp..."
Phyllis,"Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more."
Michael,"I know, I know."
Stanley,This is - nice! All of us back together.
Jim,...in your condo complex.
Michael,This Why would somebody throw that out?
Michael,I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
Dwight,"Hey You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?"
Jim,M. Night Shulman?
Michael,"Yeah, she does - she loves purple. Does it stink?"
Michael,"First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -"
Dwight,Yeah
Stanley,When are we getting to sales topics?
Michael,"Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read"
Dwight,"Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?"
Dwight,Hope - grows.
Michael,"Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. No, no, meeting's not over."
Michael,In the dump.
Phyllis,But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Dwight,Woo hoo!
Michael,No sales topic per se.
Stanley,Good news that you found our leads?
Andy,Well then no Andy Bernard per se.
Michael,No! Better!
Michael,Dwight?
Dwight,We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.
Dwight,"Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make."
Phyllis,Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Michael,"I would like your undivided attention, please."
Dwight,"Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only"
Dwight,You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Andy,It's freezing out here.
Michael,"Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was"
Erin,Go on. I have warm blood.
Dwight,"Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier."
Andy,"Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met."
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,When I was asking about the leads.
Michael,M-hmm.
Dwight,... is there any news on the leads?
Michael,Is that all you have to say to me?
Dwight,"Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! Alright, Dwight out!"
Dwight,"Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?"
Angela,Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Phyllis,"Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk."
Michael,"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque."
Jim,"Oh, sorry, wait one second."
Michael,Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
Jim,"This is actually a big potential sale, so..."
Michael,You writing your memoirs over there?
Jim,You writing your name over there?
Michael,"Well, it's a pretty big check."
Jim,"That's good. You know, with the kid."
Michael,Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
Jim,"Alright, here we go. Michael..."
Michael,"I'm just saying, that -"
Jim,Michael - Great.
Andy,"Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... I'm making a sale. Sales."
Darryl,There's other pencil's in this office.
Andy,Give me that
Michael,Honey and jelly sandwich time.
Darryl,Michael.
Michael,"Oh, you got to be kidding me. Look at that. That's -"
Darryl,I know who did that.
Michael,You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
Darryl,Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Michael,The sales department smashed my sandwich.
Darryl,"Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them."
Michael,You don't get it.
Darryl,You need to get back on top.
Michael,That's what she said.
Darryl,Yeah.
Michael,Yeah.
Erin,"Something came for you, Michael."
Michael,Thank you very much.
Jim,What'd you get?
Michael,"Ah, just the stupid leads."
Jim,Alright!
Stanley,About time.
Andy,Me likey!
Phyllis,"Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads."
Michael,"Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you."
Stanley,"We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!"
Gabe,"Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out."
Michael,"Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone."
Gabe,"Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -"
Michael,They act like I have no power.
Gabe,But you do. You are in charge -
Miichael,Thank you.
Gabe,#NAME?
Michael,"Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that."
Gabe,"Okay, good."
Michael,Exactly that.
Gabe,Good.
Michael,Exactly that.
Gabe,Why do you keep repeating -
Michael,"Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed!"
Phyllis,What are you -
Michael,- and to King Meredith!
Stanley,They aren't salespeople!
Michael,And to King Angela! Because today we are all kings. And queens.
Phyllis,What the hell do you think you're doing?
Michael,"I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis."
Jim,Hey.
Michael,Hey.
Jim,"So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?"
Michael,Mm-hmm.
Jim,"Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?"
Michael,Okay.
Jim,"Hey, alright."
Michael,Alright.
Jim,"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?"
Michael,"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?"
Jim,I don't think you understand -
Michael,I do understand it.
Jim,This one's a map.
Michael,Or is it?
Angela,"Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail."
Phyllis,Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Angela,I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work
Phyllis,What are these for?
Angela,"It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them."
Kelly,I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Ryan,It's my -
Stanley,The Kardashians is a good show.
Ryan,No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Kelly,It's about a family. A real-life family.
Ryan,"No, Stanley, do you -"
Pam,"Hey baby, what's up?"
Jim,I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Pam,Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
Jim,"Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more."
Jim,Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies - that's just unfair.
Jim,"How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'"
Pam,"He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca."
Jim,I love you.
Michael,Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally
Andy,Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
Erin,Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. I hid the leads.
Andy,Where?
Erin,Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Andy,Are you...
Erin,Lower.
Andy,Are you sure?
Erin,Lower
Dwight,"What are you doing, idiot?"
Jim,Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
Dwight,Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Jim,Lincoln.
Dwight,The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
Jim,It involves you too.
Dwight,The leads are in?
Dwight,"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in."
Michael,"Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'."
Dwight,"Kevin! Damnit Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -"
Kevin,You are never going to find them.
Dwight,Really.
Kevin,I'm going to enjoy this.
Dwight,Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Kevin,I'm still enjoying it.
Dwight,Where are they?
Kevin,Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
Dwight,"Turn the trash It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress."
Meredith,Okey-dokey.
Kevin,"No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen."
Meredith,It's coming off anyway.
Dwight,Clean sack.
Kevin,What -
Erin,I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Toby,"If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads."
Dwight,It's empty!
Michael,Wait. What day is today?
Kevin,"Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday."
Michael,"Oh my god. Oh my god oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey wait, wait!"
Michael,"Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -"
Phyllis,"Michael, why would we all go to the dump?"
Michael,"Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump."""
Stanley,"Not your staff, Michael. You."
Michael,"Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -"
Toby,"Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?"
Michael,Really?
Angela,"I'm not going. You did this, not us."
Michael,"Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit Complicit. You were all successories!"
Darryl,"That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go."
Michael,You can.
Darryl,I can't. You know that.
Michael,"Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself."
Dwight,"I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up."
Dwight,This place has gone to hell.
Michael,"You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me."
Dwight,"Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak."
Michael,"Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters."
Kelly,"You're adorable. You need to go for it. I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -"
Jim,Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Kelly,Why?
Jim,Just all the - drama.
Kelly,What drama?
Jim,"Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?"
Kelly,So unnecessary.
Jim,"Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that."
Kelly,"I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?"
Jim,I have new baby pictures.
Kelly,Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
Jim,She's wearing a onesie
Stanley,"If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly."
Jim,Didn't we kind of start it?
Phyllis,I think you're remembering that wrong?
Andy,Yeah.
Phyllis,"I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India."
Jim,"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?"
Andy,"All those who agree, say aye All those opposed -"
Jim,I don't think we need opposed.
Michael,"You've changed, man."
Dwight,"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?"
Michael,"Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent."
Dwight,Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
Michael,"No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight."
Dwight,"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -"
Michael,Assistant to the managed him -
Dwight,"Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!"
Michael,Yeah.
Dwight,"Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere."
Michael,You think you would have done better without me? Really?
Dwight,I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Michael,Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
Dwight,Kung-fu movies!
Michael,"You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -"
Dwight,Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
Michael,"That's my wife you're talking about, man."
Dwight,Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? You watch it!
Michael,"If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you."
Dwight,Don't do it
Michael,"No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. No, time out, time out. Time in!"
Dwight,No!
Michael,Don't even think about that
Dwight,"Stop it, get out! That's my spool."
Phyllis,What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Jim,I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Andy,And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
Phyllis,I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Stanley,That is a dangerous precedent.
Jim,Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Phyllis,"Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one."
Dwight,Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Bar Manager,Get out. Now.
Michael,How many is that?
Michael,"Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry."
Dwight,"Not counting the last one, 25."
Pam,"Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot."
Michael,Count the last one.
Michael,She can't talk to us that way.
Dwight,"Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!"
Pam,"You guys are stripes, I think..."
Michael,"Oh, new record!"
Michael,"You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?"
Dwight,Okay.
Jim,It stopped.
Michael,"Oh, what did you do today?"
Michael,"Well, I am starting it again!"
Jim,I made a sale.
Pam,Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Michael,"Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat."
Michael,"Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize."
Meredith,What do we get if we do 'em?
Bar Manager,Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.
Michael,"My respect. Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -"
Michael,I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Dwight,And one girl push-up.
Bar Manager,"Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir."
Michael,"Gets to go home. Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. Disqualified!"
Michael,"Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you."
Angela,Ow!
Bar Manager,Is that how you do it?
Michael,"What do we got? Creed, disqualified."
Michael,Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
Creed,"Oh, come on!"
Bar Manager,Really? How much have you written?
Jim,19. I had a really hard work out this morning.
Michael,I've written all of it... in my head.
Michael,"Oh, wow, that is adorable!"
Bar Manager,Oh.
Phyllis,Ten...
Michael,"If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up."
Michael,"Yeah, I'm betting one more."
Bar Manager,Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic.
Phyllis,"Eleven, wow!"
Michael,"Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it."
Michael,Good.
Bar Manager,"Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow."
Everyone,Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley...
Michael,I own a Chrysler.
Michael,"Alright, alright."
Bar Manager,Shut up.
Oscar,"Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby."
Michael,"No, you shut up."
Michael,"Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down."
Bar Manager,What's your drink?
Dwight,"25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!"
Michael,Grenadine.
Phyllis,"One more, one more!"
Bar Manager,What?
Oscar,"You okay? You okay, Stanley?"
Andy,"We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead."
Stanley,Excuse me.
Erin,Okay.
Jim,Wow.
Andy,Hi.
Oscar,"Hey. Matt, right?"
Girl at table,Hi.
Matt,"Hey, Oscar. You're here early."
Andy,"I don't normally do this, but..."
Oscar,I always come in at 7.
Girl at table,Do what?
Warehouse Guy,"No, you don't."
Andy,Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
Oscar,"Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?"
Erin,"Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?"
Matt,"I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know."
Andy,What are you doing?
Oscar,Yeah.
Erin,What we said to do.
Oscar,"Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. Just a couple of hours to kill before work."
Andy,"We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!"
Darryl,"Hey, what's up?"
Erin,I was flirting with a man.
Oscar,"Hey, nice office."
Andy,Get in here. Where did you learn to talk like that?
Darryl,"Thanks, it's cool. So..."
Erin,The movies. I don't know.
Oscar,"You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink."
Andy,"Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?"
Darryl,Has that ever happened? Ever?
Michael,I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
Oscar,Didn't we? I think we did.
Bar Manager,You have a card?
Darryl,You want me to invite Matt?
Michael,I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
Oscar,"Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included."
Bar Manager,Stanley Hudson?
Darryl,"Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me."
Michael,"No, no."
Oscar,So happy hour.
Bar Manager,"Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson's in here."
Darryl,Happy hour. My pleasure.
Michael,"No, it's Michael Scott."
Oscar,All right.
Bar Manager,Michael Scott?
Oscar,So what do you think?
Michael,He is I.
Phyllis,"Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob."
Bar Manager,You just won yourself a lunch.
Phyllis,"Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?"
Michael,"Oh, hey guys."
Andy,A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Julie,I think I'm gonna go.
Jim,"I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in."
Pam,Really?
Andy,"Oh, baloney."
Julie,Yeah.
Jim,Good one.
Pam,"I'm sorry, he's not usually like that."
Andy,Ring her up.
Julie,What's he usually like?
Jim,"Absolutely, I will do that right now."
Pam,"He's more, just... like... you can go."
Jim,"I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much."
Julie,Yeah.
Jim,"So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-"
Jim,All right.
Pam,Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Pam,Okay. Bye.
Andy,Ha! Knew it!
Jim,See ya. Nice girl.
Pam,"It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!"
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,I did not see this coming.
Michael,"Hey, Julie! You having fun?"
Andy,"Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. Are you going later?"
Bar Manager,"So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too."
Erin,"Sure, if you are."
Darryl,"Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?"
Andy,Yes.
Oscar,I couldn't understand a word he said.
Erin,"Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off."
Darryl,"Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common."
Andy,Whoa.
Oscar,Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Andy,"We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama."
Matt,"Hey, what's up?"
Erin,Exactly.
Oscar,"There he is! Hey, hey, hey."
Andy,"Yeah, cause when everyone knows- That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know."
Matt,Anyone up for some hoops?
Erin,Quiet.
Oscar,Sure. Hoops!
Andy,"Hey, boss man."
Matt,Let's do it.
Michael,Yes?
Oscar,"Hoop it up, right."
Andy,"A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?"
Andy,This is not what I want my relationship to look like.
Michael,"Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time."
Andy,"Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you."
Andy,"I'm sorry, I meant later."
Andy,"You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go."
Michael,"Ok, yes. Sure."
Erin,You love drama.
Andy,For happy hour?
Andy,"I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen."
Michael,"No, I got that."
Dwight,"With this move, he can't get you."
Andy,Trying to get a head count.
Isabel,"Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler."
Michael,I am in.
Dwight,"Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!"
Andy,"All right, yes! It's a deal."
Angela,Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Michael,It's a deal.
Dwight,Sh-what?
Pam,"Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie."
Angela,You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,"No, no, no. Blah blah blah blah!"
Pam,I want her to meet Michael.
Angela,For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Jim,Why?
Isabel,What are you talking about?
Pam,"They're both single, I have a sense they might-"
Dwight,What are you-
Jim,You've been gone for a long time.
Angela,"Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me."
Pam,It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Dwight,Angela...
Kevin,Yeah!
Angela,Did he not tell you that?
Pam,"Hey, how are you?"
Dwight,You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Kevin,"Oh, I missed you so much."
Angela,Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Pam,Aw!
Dwight,"Angela, not here!"
Kevin,Yeah!
Angela,Dwight?
Pam,Yeah!
Isabel,Whack!
Kevin,Waaah!
Angela,You'll see me in small claims court!
Kevin,"When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny."
Dwight,You are an impressive specimen.
Michael,"Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!"
Isabel,Thank you.
Jim,Easy.
Kelly,"Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill."
Michael,"It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party..."
Pam,"Oh-oh, gosh. Oh."
Jim,"Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth."
Jim,You all right?
Michael,Sucks to be you.
Pam,"Okay, we have to get home."
Jim,Would you like to be our fourth?
Kevin,Yeah!
Michael,That would be sublime.
Michael,"Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady."
Jim,All right.
Jim,"Actually, you didn't."
Darryl,"So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs."
Pam,Not at all.
Pam,"Hey, Michael."
Michael,"I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me."
Michael,Yes.
Darryl,"Tell 'em your story, Hide."
Pam,This is my friend Julie.
Hide,"In Japan, heart surgeon. Number one. Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die. Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No English, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret"
Michael,"Hello, how are you?"
Julie,Good. Hi.
Michael,What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?
Pam,Julie laughs at everything.
Julie,So you work with Pam and Jim?
Michael,"Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired."
Julie,I should hope not.
Michael,"No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win."
Isabel,Hey.
Pam,"Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness."
Isabel,Of course.
Pam,You want to play pool?
Isabel,"Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone."
Pam,Ok.
Angela,"And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-"
Dwight,"Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel."
Isabel,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Isabel,A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
Dwight,"Ooh, I love repartee."
Isabel,Do you?
Dwight,Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
Michael,"So, what do you do?"
Julie,I am an ESL teacher.
Michael,Really?
Julie,Yeah.
Michael,"See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?"
Julie,Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?'
Michael,Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
Julie,"I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done."
Jim,So what do you think?
Michael,About what?
Jim,About Julie?
Michael,She's nice.
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,Yeah.
Jim,So you like her?
Michael,"Uh, yeah, sure."
Jim,So Pam was right?
Michael,About what?
Jim,About you two hitting it off.
Michael,"Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything."
Hide,"My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart."
Oscar,I know.
Pam,"Hey, Michael, where have you been?"
Jim,"Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?"
Pam,Why are you wearing a hat now?
Michael,"Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang."
Michael,"Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?"
Jim,You want to just make a run for it?
Pam,Maybe.
Kevin,Waaaah! Waaaaah! Mommy!
Jim,What is happening?
Andy,Whoa! What is crackin?
Ryan,"Guys, one second."
Kelly,"We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk."
Erin,What's this game?
Ryan,One second.
Andy,"Yeah, how do you play?"
Ryan,"Guys, guys, guys, please. Ok, all right, it's all yours now."
Kelly,Only three tickets.
Ryan,"If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time."
Kelly,Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
Ryan,"I know, but you wanted the big thing."
Andy,"Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?"
Erin,Oh I know.
Andy,"They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'"
Erin,"'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'"
Andy,"'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch."
Erin,"Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart."
Andy,No drama. Ok.
Isabel,"Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole."
Dwight,Any brothers or sisters?
Isabel,Three brothers.
Dwight,Really?
Isabel,"Two are in the Marines, one's a cop."
Dwight,Vegetarian?
Isabel,No. I love meat.
Dwight,What's your blood type?
Isabel,O-negative. Universal donor.
Dwight,Universal donor.
Dwight,"Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela."
Michael,"Hey, guys, guys, guys. Watch this. Ready?"
Julie,What are you doing?
Michael,I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
Jim,"Michael, you don't have to do this."
Michael,"Wow. Oh, wow, that was close."
Michael,"I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers."
Phyllis,"Hey, you two having fun?"
Andy,Did you tell them?
Erin,No.
Andy,"This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!"
Erin,I get it.
Isabel,You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
Dwight,Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Isabel,Whack!
Dwight,Extend the fingers more.
Isabel,Whack!
Dwight,Good.
Angela,This looks like a hoot.
Dwight,"Hey, monkey, how you doing?"
Angela,Whack.
Dwight,"Listen, can I talk to you for a second?"
Angela,Okay.
Dwight,"Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore."
Angela,It's no worry.
Dwight,"It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family."
Angela,I could see enjoying that.
Dwight,"No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook."
Angela,But we signed the contract.
Dwight,"Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later."
Angela,We both-you didn't dup-
Jim,Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Pam,Maybe it should come from a man.
Jim,Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Bar Manager,Hello.
Michael,Hello.
Bar Manager,Hi.
Michael,Hi.
Bar Manager,You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?
Michael,"Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?"
Pam,"Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down."
Michael,"Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun."
Bar Manager,"Ted, are we having fun?"
Michael,Really? You told on me. That's lame.
Bouncer,We got a problem?
Michael,Yes. Homelessness. What?
Bar Manager,"All right, go."
Michael,Where?
Michael,Erin?
Cookie Monster,"Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them."
Erin,Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
Andy,This is awesome!
Michael,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?"
Oscar,Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Erin,I can't trust Andy anymore.
Cookie Monster,"What's the difference between a chimichanga, a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent."
Michael,Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Kevin,This isn't funny. I don't talk like that.
Erin,It's Andy's fault.
Phyllis,"Say ""Me eat cookie."""
Michael,"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis."
Kevin,No. I won't say it.
Erin,"Oh, I like his butt."
Dwight,"Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique."
Michael,You said butt.
Ryan,It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
Erin,You tricked me!
Dwight,Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Michael,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him"
Phyllis,Mm-hmm.
Andy,"Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day."
Dwight,I love that show.
Oscar's voice from the computer,Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost.
Cookie Monster,This is Kevin. This is Kevin.
Kevin,I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Ryan,"Good work, buddy."
Phyllis,I don't get it.
Oscar,Thank you.
Jim,"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice."
Dwight,"That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please."
Pam,"Yeah. ""I vant to count to ten""."
Oscar,Yes.
Kevin,"But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers."
Kelly,"Me, too Oscar."
Kelly,But you're an accountant too.
Ryan,C.C. me
Oscar,Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
Kevin,"Angela, this is inappropriate."
Pam,That would have been funny.
Angela,This is my favorite day.
Kevin,But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Andy,"It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture.. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7"
Michael,"Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? ""Oscar. I am the Count."" Nailed him. Nailed him. Good work Cookie Monster."
Meredith,Here you go.
Kevin,Thank you.
Erin,"Oh, thank you."
Andy,I do.
Dwight,
Erin,Thank you.
Andy,"If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom."
Erin,Welcome back!
Pam,"Hey, thanks."
Pam,"It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off."
Pam,Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
Jim,I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Dwight,"Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die."
Pam,"It's nice to see you again, Dwight."
Dwight.,"Hello, Pam."
Andy,I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Michael,I'm going to give Erin $15.
Erin,I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Michael,A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
Andy,Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing..
Michael,She's kind of a rube.
Andy,That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
Michael,Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
Andy,She's gonna be so psyched.
Michael,"Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day."
Erin,"Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss."
Michael,I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
Erin,I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Michael,Ugh.
Erin,Just the two of us.
Michael,"Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm..."
Erin,"Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but..."
Michael,"Okay, well, we'll figure something."
Erin,Oh.
Michael,"Okay, let's go to Hayworth's."
Erin,Okay.
Michael,All right.
Meredith,"Have a cookie, Kev."
Kevin,"Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that."
Darryl,I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Kevin,"Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. Happy Birthday."
Darryl,Thank you.
Darryl,"Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum."
Kevin,"They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me."
Kevin,"Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level..."
Gabe,This is violent and offensive.
Kevin,Thank you. It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Gabe,It's awful.
Kevin,I'm not crying.
Gabe,You have some food on your face.
Kevin,Do my hands feel sweaty to you?
Gabe,The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
Gabe,"Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around."
Kevin,Yeah.
Gabe,"And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao."
Michael,Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
Erin,I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
Michael,I don't know.
Erin,I would have chosen the 1490's.
Michael,Ahhh.
Erin,'Cause America was discovered.
Michael,Right.
Erin,"And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk.. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?"
Michael,An age or month?
Erin,"Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven."
Michael,I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
Erin,How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Michael,So how are things going with Andy?
Erin,He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Michael,"Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo."
Erin,Yeah I love that.
Michael,"Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser."
Erin,What?
Michael,I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.
Erin,Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Michael,Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
Hayworth's waiter,Here we go. Hot plate.
Michael,Okay.
Hayworth's waiter,"And your salad, miss."
Erin,Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Michael,I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.
Erin,They had s*x?
Michael,"They were engaged, so... Okay, you know what, sir?"
Hayworth's waiter,Yes?
Michael,"Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?"
Hayworth's waiter,Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.
Michael,Thank you.
Erin,"Uhhhh, they were engaged?"
Michael,Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Erin,Uh-oh...
Michael,Well...
Erin,
Michael,What are you doing? What are you doing?
Erin,"In the Foster home, my hair was my room."
Michael,"Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now."
Erin,
Michael,I'll have what she's having!
Michael,Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
Pam,Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
Jim,What's up?
Dwight,Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Jim,"Dwight, don't be gross."
Pam,"No, no, he's right."
Dwight,"Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy."
Pam,"That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?"
Dwight,"All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me."
Pam,"You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?"
Dwight,Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Pam,Mm. Meredith!
Meredith,I just like the way it feels.
Pam,What are you doing?!
Meredith,Just relax. Okay.
Pam,Relax?!
Meredith,This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
Pam,Give it back to me now.
Meredith,"Okay, I was just warming it up."
Pam,It's disgusting!
Meredith,It's not a big deal.
Pam,It's not sterile!
Meredith,We're both girls. Who cares?
Andy,So... how was lunch?
Erin,Lunch was fine.
Andy,Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
Erin,"I don't know. It was lunch, Andy."
Andy,"Well, I know. Just want... I mean..."
Oscar,Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Erin,"God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy."
Kelly,"""My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant."" See I did the voice."
Ryan,That's a little derivative.
Kelly,But parody is always derivative.
Ryan,"Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?"
Pam,Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Jim,"Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. ""Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall."""
Gabe,"Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?"
Jim,"""Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies."""
Gabe,Ok.
Andy,"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself."
Michael,"You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.."
Andy,I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
Michael,No. No. No.
Andy,Specific shout-out..
Michael,Stop talking.
Andy,"Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three.."
Erin,I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Michael,Oh God.
Andy,Can we talk about this in private?
Erin,I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Andy,Yes.
Erin,Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Pam,"No, no never."
Erin,Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Dwight,Yeah pretty much.
Erin,Who are you?! I don't know you!
Gabe,"I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue."
Kevin,"Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you."
Erin,Thanks.
Kevin,"So if you need anything, I'm right over there."
Pam,"""Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful."""
Gabe,"Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days."
Pam,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?"
Jim,I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Gabe,"Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. Ok fine. You too Dwight."
Dwight,"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making."
Gabe,I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
Kevin,"""C"" is for suspension."
Andy,Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
Michael,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap."
Andy,"I was going to tell her, just on my own time."
Michael,"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret."
Andy,"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things."
Angela,Psst. Hey. Erin.
Erin,"You want to talk to me, come to my desk."
Angela,You embarrassed me earlier.
Erin,Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Angela,You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Erin,I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Angela,You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Toby,"I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know."
Pam,Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Erin,Really?
Pam,Yeah. And he worked here too.
Erin,"It was Andy, wasn't it?"
Pam,"No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants."
Erin,I hope you find what you're looking for.
Pam,Thank you.
Gabe,So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
Pam,Hey Toby.
Toby,"I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal."
Pam,Very interesting.
Toby,"Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure..."
Pam,Thanks Toby.
Gabe,"Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension."
Pam,I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Jim,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that."
Dwight,"Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize."
Gabe,Great.
Dwight,I kneel before you.
Gabe,"Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology."
Dwight,Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
Gabe,"Guys, to err is human."
Erin,Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Andy,"Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill."
Erin,How long were you guys together?
Andy,A year.
Erin,A year? You were together for a year?
Andy,Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
Erin,I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Andy,I didn't see that movie.
Gabe,That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
Kelly,Do they still get paid?
Gabe,It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
Oscar,Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Meredith,Pathetic.
Gabe,"Can I buy everyone coffees? ""Or cookies."""
Dwight,What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Gabe,Alright.
Kevin,"Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person."
Gabe,You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
Dwight,"""I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit."""
Kevin,"""Ciao"" Right? ""Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee."""
Gabe,Why don't we say ciao to the impressions?
Erin,
Michael,"Buenos dias, Erin."
Donna,Bye-bye!
Erin,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Hello, Dunder-Mifflin."
Michael,And have a good elevator ride.
Michael,"No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor."
Donna,Okay.
Michael,"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun."
Michael,"Oh, what's that out there?"
Michael,"Buenos dias, Jaime."
Kevin,"Michael, how did it go?"
Jim,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?"
Dwight,How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Michael,"Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!"
Erin,Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Dwight,"Guten tag, Herr Michael."
Dwight,"I wasn't talking to you, pale-face."
Dwight,"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid."
Erin,I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Michael,La telefona.
Dwight,What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Oscar,El telefono.
Stanley,"Dwight, I know these programs. ""Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow."""
Oscar,"Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... I should have been more specific."
Dwight,Yes.
Oscar,Your office is full of genitalia.
Stanley,I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Michael,"Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!"
Erin,Mm!
Oscar,"""That's what he says?"""
Dwight,"Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective."
Michael,"Damn it. Ah, Angelo."
Oscar,"Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is."
Angela,Angela. Michael.
Dwight,I can protect you from Kelly. Will you get out of here? Seriously.
Michael,Yo soy Cancun.
Kelly,"For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them."
Angela,Uhh!
Dwight,"Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program ""print in all colors"" initiative."
Jim,"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee."
Kelly,Dwight
Pam,"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, ""I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee."""
Dwight,Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Jim,"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that."
Kelly,"God, I hate you so much!"
Michael,Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
Dwight,"Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate."
Dwight,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs."
Hide,Why? I don't need translator.
Michael,I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Dwight,You don't know what you need. Just...
Dwight,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?"
Gabe,"Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide."
Jim,That's a good point.
Hide,"In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand."
Pam,This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
Pam,"Hey, Michael. How you doing?"
Jim,Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Michael,I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
Pam,"We have good give and take. I give, he takes."
Pam,"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you."
Jim,I don't even know who you are anymore.
Michael,She suckered you too.
Pam,Yee.
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Donna,"Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott."
Michael,Was it the cleavage?
Jim,"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim."
Pam,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts."
Donna,Hi!
Michael,Yep.
Jim,How are you?
Phyllis,"Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far."
Michael,Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Andy,"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused."
Donna,"Oh, stop that."
Erin,"Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?"
Michael,Hi. How are you?
Michael,God. She left this here?
Michael,"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so..."
Erin,Yeah.
Michael,"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today."
Michael,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Donna,You look exactly alike.
Jim,What?
Pam,"Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister."
All,No.
Donna,I have a sense about these things.
Michael,Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
Jim,All right.
Oscar,"It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened."
Donna,You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
Pam,Michael...
Angela,I knew it. You should see their baby.
Michael,Well...
Jim,"So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate So it's a tradeoff."
Pam,She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
Michael,Hi.
Michael,"Yeah, I know. I know."
Jim,Hold on one second.
Pam,I'm sorry.
Michael,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?"
Michael,I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
Jim,What?
Pam,Michael!
Michael,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Michael,
Jim,None of this is time sensitive.
Donna,Michael!
Michael,"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May."
Michael,Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
Donna,"Oh, yeah, thank you."
Gabe,"Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. All right."
Michael,"Okay, I have more of them."
Gabe,They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
Gabe,"You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities."
Kelly,And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Darryl,Sounds all right.
Erin,"Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?"
Dwight,What is this?
Kelly,Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Gabe,"Oh, this is ""Print in All Colors,"" Sabre's minority executive training program."
Erin,Great.
Dwight,"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing."
Dwight,"Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it."
Darryl,"I didn't say ""a'ight."""
Kelly,"Thank you, Dwight."
Dwight,How do I apply?
Dwight,Oh.
Gabe,You have to be a minority.
Kelly,I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Dwight,"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?"
Dwight,Gosh. He he.
Gabe,Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Kelly,Because I never forget anything.
Dwight,Come here. Come here.
Dwight,"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?"
Gabe,Hmm?
Michael,You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
Dwight,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?"
Donna,"No, y-you were... right."
Gabe,Well...
Michael,Who?
Darryl,I like the sound of this. Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Donna,You were right.
Dwight,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?"
Michael,About what?
Kelly,"This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing."
Donna,You were right. I'm sorry.
Dwight,"Oh, man. White people, right?"
Michael,"No, no. No."
Kelly,I don't know if she was white.
Donna,I'm sor...
Dwight,"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice."
Michael,No...
Kelly,Yeah.
Michael,What happened?
Dwight,"I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race."
Erin,Kelly got into the minority training program.
Kelly,"Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right."
Michael,"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! I kissed. We kissed."
Dwight,I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Kevin,Ooh.
Kelly,Never thought of myself as an executive before.
Phyllis,"Oh, Michael."
Dwight,"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?"
Michael,"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did."
Kelly,"I can't think of any CEO's, any race."
Michael,You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. I did do it!
Dwight,You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
Kelly,I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
Dwight,That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Michael,"I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white."
Donna,Mm-hmm.
Michael,"And that would be a display of the crisp, gorgeous black."
Donna,Yeah.
Michael,"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on."
Michael,This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
Donna,Who took the photo?
Michael,Ryan.
Donna,Oh.
Michael,And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
Donna,Not bad.
Michael,"Oh, thanks. You're not bad, either."
Donna,Thank you. Hmm.
Michael,Hmm.
Donna,Oh my God.
Michael,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
Michael,"You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?"
Jim,No.
Pam,I'll have one.
Jim,"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work."
Michael,"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam."
Jim,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant."
Pam,"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here."
Donna,"Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering."
Michael,"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it."
Pam,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Jim,What?
Jim,What was that?
Pam,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Jim,"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale."
Pam,Who cares? It's not that huge a sale.
Jim,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale."
Pam,"Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. Good luck, wingman."
Dwight,How as being a minority affected you?
Kelly,"Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy."
Dwight,"Oh, good, and you resent this because..."
Kelly,Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Dwight,"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house."
Kelly,Just put it in your pocket.
Michael and Donna,
Kevin,Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Phyllis,You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Creed,You ever notice you can ooze two things
Phyllis,She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Pam,Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
Kevin,Like that?
Donna,Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
Jim,"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility."
Donna,"Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like."
Jim,Yeah.
Michael,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?"
Jim,What's that?
Michael,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
Jim,I don't... I don't think so.
Michael,I think we could.
Oscar,I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Michael,"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes."
Oscar,"Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money."
Michael,Why don't you run them again?
Jim,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Michael,"If she is, it's working."
Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says ""no,"" then she is not interested."
Jim,She does not like him.
Pam,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Jim,'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Pam,I was after your money.
Jim,"Well, the joke was on you."
Pam,"Yes, it was."
Kelly,Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Ryan,Okay...
Dwight,Hey... what are you guys doing?
Kelly,"This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic."
Ryan,Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Kelly,"Oh, that is so good."
Dwight,"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview."
Kelly,"Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me."
Dwight,Ryan? What does he know?
Ryan,It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
Kelly,Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
Dwight,"""We?"""
Kelly,"When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager."
Ryan,And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Dwight,"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate."
Michael,So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Donna,Mm-hmm.
Michael,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. Just kidding. Do you like mints?
Donna,Yes.
Michael,I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Donna,"Oh, I haven't tried those. No."
Michael,They're good
Donna,You want one?
Michael,Sure.
Donna,"It's like cool... ""certified cool."" I like how they say ""certified."" Like there's some consortium of... Michael!"
Michael,I can't stop myself from kissing her.
Kevin,"Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day."
Andy,"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?"
Kevin,"Well, why don't you shut up!"
Michael,"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time."
Jim,It is totally insane.
Oscar,"Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker."
Michael,Okay. What do you think?
Kevin,"I think it's over, man."
Michael,Andy?
Andy,Ehh.
Michael,"Okay, some for, some against."
Jim,Nobody's for.
Michael,Pam?
Pam,Hmm?
Mihael,What do you think?
Pam,"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely."
Jim,Okay.
Pam,Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
Jim,What?
Pam,"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt."
Michael,I'm going with Pam's group.
Jim,Wait.
Michael,Here we go.
Jim,Michael. Michael.
Michael,Okay.
Jim,Michael.
Michael,"No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck."
Jim,No.
Michael,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point."
Dwight,Kelly is disqualified!
Gabe,What?
Dwight,"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America."
Gabe,"Yeah, but she's not white, though."
Dwight,"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic."
Gabe,"Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone."
Darryl,"I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though."
Dwight,Kelly is the only applicant.
Gabe,"Yeah, unless somebody else applies today."
Kelly,Namaste.
Dwight,"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back."
Kelly,Hello.
Gabe,That's very nice. I never noticed that before.
Kelly,Sometimes my bangs cover it.
Gabe,"Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?"
Kelly,"I do find that offensive, actually."
Michael,We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Donna,"Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then."
Michael,Okay.
Donna,"And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you."
Michael,"Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too."
Donna,Thank you. Did I... get everything?
Michael,I don't know. I think so.
Donna,"Yeah, I think so."
Michael,"Okay. So... Oh, Donna?"
Donna,Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
Donna,"No, it's just in the lot, so..."
Michael,Thank you so much.
Donna,You're welcome. You're... welcome.
Michael,Mmm.
Donna,Bye.
Michael,"Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have..."
Donna,"I don't have, uh, any other questions. I'm just gonna... make my way down to..."
Michael,All right. All right. Bye.
Andy,There what is?
Dwight,Stop it!
Darryl,What?
Jim,Stop what?
Michael,Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
Dwight,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!"
Pam,I don't know who he is.
Jim,"Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you."
Michael,God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Jim,Yup. That's exactly what we did.
Pam,What?
Pam,"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, ""I will when you lose the baby weight."""
Michael,"I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him."
Dwight,Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Pam,You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Michael,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
Michael,I have to hear it from her.
Jim,It's a pen.
Pam,You have to settle down first.
Dwight,"Michael, come on."
Michael,I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
Michael,"Get back to work, Dwight. Please."
Pam,Okay. Okay. Yes.
Dwight,Fine. Hey. Tap away.
Michael,I need to have her say...
Michael,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!"
Pam,"Yeah, but you have to calm..."
Michael,"Who enjoys the weekends? Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have s*x. Did I say that? Yes, I did. And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out."
Michael,"I need to say, ""What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"""
Stanley,I have an idea for your weekend.
Pam,"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!"
Stanley,Let me get back to my desk right now.
Pam,"Hi, Michael, hi, Michael"
Michael,"Okay, you get out of here, big dog. Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas."
Michael,Okay. Okay. Okay.
Pam,Stanley got to go.
Gabe,"I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts."
Michael,"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out."
Michael,You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Andy,Walk around apple orchards.
Donna,"Yeah, we should."
Michael,Oh!
Michael,Wouldn't that be fun?
Andy,Super romantic.
Donna,Yeah.
Michael,That's fun.
Michael,How about Thursday?
Dwight,Eel fishing.
Donna,"Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?"
Michael,All right.
Michael,I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Darryl,Curl up with your favorite DVD.
Donna,"Oh, Friday doesn't work."
Meredith,You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Michael,"Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert."
Michael,"We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's."
Donna,Shoot. I'm working.
Kelly,"Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton."
Michael,"Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by."
Michael,"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, ""I wanna go to Mount Pocono,"" you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI."
Donna,"Well, won't you be at the concert?"
Kelly,"Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?"
Michael,"Nope, that's Tuesday."
Michael,"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World"
Donna,"Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday."
Ryan,Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Michael,You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Michael,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
Donna,How do you know?
Pam,"No, Michael, no."
Michael,Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna
Dwight,Are you nuts?
Pam,Did she see me?
Pam,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
Jim,Nice effort.
Michael,"... and... we had s*x, too."
Andy,"We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress."
Pam,That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Darryl,You haven't even introduced yourself.
Michael,How?
Andy,"Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much."
Pam,How what?
Darryl,You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Michael,How do I not make any more of it?
Andy,Higher? Okay. Recently certain events have come to my attention...
Pam,You could start by concluding this meeting.
Darryl,Higher.
Michael,"All right. And she won't say, ""I love you."""
Andy,Make it higher? Okay.
Dwight,"Oh, no."
Darryl,Mm-hmm
Andy,How many dates have you been on?
Andy,I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Michael,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Darryl,"One more, yeah."
Andy,Mm.
Andy,May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... ah! It's working. It's... I knew it!
Oscar,That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
Darryl,This...
Ryan,"Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?"
Andy,"We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing."
Ryan,Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before s*x? Does she shower after s*x? Does she...
Darryl,"I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore."
Michael,"Yeah, she does all that."
Michael,Who is he?
Ryan,"Sorry, dude."
Donna,"What, what do you mean?"
Michael,"No, no..."
Michael,The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
Pam,"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok."
Donna,It's you. I'm married.
Michael,Run what?
Michael,I'm the mistress?
Pam,"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control."
Dwight,"Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill."
Michael,"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?"
Gym Instructor,"Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this."
Pam,"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control."
Dwight,"You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!"
Michael,"Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world."
Gym instructor,"Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill."
Jim,You do?
Dwight,No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Michael,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit."
Gym instructor,"No, guys, no. We're just cooling down..."
Jim,But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Dwight,"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate."
Michael,That's what makes it so wrong.
Michael,"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me."
Dwight,"Oh, God, that tickles. What did..."
Michael,I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
Dwight,I think I've got one for you.
Michael,This is you. How much do you charge?
Dwight,"$100 a day, plus expenses."
Michael,I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
Dwight,I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,And you might not like how I find it.
Andy,"Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire."
Stanley,My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Andy,"Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important."
Gabe,"There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?"
Andy,"Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire."
Gabe,That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Andy,What are we gonna do about this?
Gabe,"I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah."
Andy,Let me know what they say.
Darryl,Wow. That dude is good.
Andy,What do you mean?
Darryl,You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Andy,I don't know.
Darryl,Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Darryl,"Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said ""Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."""
Dwight,Hi stranger.
Donna,"Oh, hi. You work for Michael."
Dwight,I work with Michael.
Donna,Right.
Dwight,Dwight Schrute.
Donna,"Donna, hi."
Dwight,"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news."
Jim,"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?"
Michael,"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives."
Pam,Oh!...
Jim,"Oh, my God"
Michael,"It's comfort food, all right? God."
Jim,"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up."
Michael,"I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says."
Pam,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
Michael,Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
Jim,"Michael, no..."
Pam,"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that."
Michael,It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Pam,"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael."
Michael,"God, this is so disgusting."
Pam,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
Michael,I know.
Pam,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Michael,"That's not true. You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan."
Pam,Helene.
Michael,Helene?
Pam,My mother.
Michael,Oh.
Pam,"My mother, Helene."
Michael,"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life."
Jim,"You should stop this, and you should call Dwight right now."
Michael,All right.
Dwight,"Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time"
Donna,Thank you.
Dwight,It's all yours. Ah!
Donna,You okay?
Dwight,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?"
Donna,"Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about."
Dwight,Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Dwight,Oh. Oh. Oh. One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Donna,"Nope. I'm good, thanks."
Dwight,"Really? Hey, um..."
Old lady,"Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?"
Dwight,Get out of my way. Huh!
Dwight,"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?"
Donna,I'm out of here.
Dwight,"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here"
Donna,"You stay away from me, or I'm calling security."
Dwight,"Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh!"
Michael,You're back. What happened?
Dwight,"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking."
Michael,"No, what happened with Donna?"
Dwight,"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here."
Michael,Ugh!
Dwight,Put your fingers here.
Michael,No. No! Are you sure?
Dwight,"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there."
Michael,Who eats eight protein bars?
Dwight,People who don't trust egg whites.
Michael,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over."
Dwight,"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious."
Michael,"What? No, she didn't say that."
Dwight,"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, ""What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him."" And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office."
Michael,I am not paying for that membership.
Michael,Ohhh... mmm...
Erin,Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Michael,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?"
Erin,"Uh, no. Wait, yes."
Michael,That's her?
Erin,Yeah.
Michael,"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. Okay, I'll talk to you later."
Donna,How could you think I would cheat on you?
Michael,I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Donna,That's pathetic.
Michael,"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want."
Donna,"When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak."
Michael,"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it."
Donna,I told you I like you.
Michael,"Well, you are boner-ific."
Donna,"Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would..."
Michael,...poop my pants.
Donna,Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
Michael,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?"
Donna,We're going.
Michael,We are?
Donna,Yeah.
Andy,What's up? I got your e-mail.
Darryl,Close the door.
Andy,Okay.
Darryl,I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. Andy don't mess with me. I'll figure something out.
Darryl,Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Andy,Such as?
Darryl,"It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was ""Andy,"" ""Problem,"" ""Eliminate,"" something. I don't know what it meant."
Andy,"What? You don't know what it meant? How about ""Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?"""
Darryl,Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
Andy,Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
Kelly,"Oh, hey, I love your earrings."
Donna,Thank you.
Kelly,Did Michael get them for you?
Donna,"No, I bought them myself."
Kelly,Where?
Donna,Steamtown Mall.
Kelly,"Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?"
Donna,"You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there."
Kelly,Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Donna,"Uh, Franklin Mills."
Jim,What?
Pam,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
Pam,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael."
Jim,"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?"
Pam,No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Creed,Psst...
Andy,Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Creed,"So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less."
Pam,"So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. This photo was taken this morning. It's Cece. She's never gonna do anything wrong."
Donna,Isn't that something?
Michael,Wow. That's exciting.
Pam,"Hey, Michael."
Michael,Hey.
Pam,"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related."
Michael,Well it can wait. It can wait.
Pam,I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
Michael,Jim is her husband.
Donna,Oh.
Pam,And...
Michael,"And they are having problems, so sh..."
Pam,"No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love..."
Michael,Good in bed.
Pam,"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my s*x life with Jim."
Michael,"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?"
Pam,I need you to sign this! So bad!
Michael,"Okay, weirdo."
Pam,I love... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely.
Donna,Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
Pam,"You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. Are you a golfer?"
Donna,"I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. Hey, you okay?"
Michael,"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?"
Pam,Absolutely.
Darryl,"Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself."
Glen,"I know, it's just, I'm scared..."
Andy,Your text said 911.
Darryl,"Glen, could you excuse us?"
Darryl,It's bad.
Andy,What's bad?
Darryl,It's real bad.
Darryl,Still no plan.
Andy,"Oh, God."
Darryl,It's getting bigger.
Andy,"I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire."
Darryl,I can videotape it.
Andy,Yeah.
Darryl,There it is.
Toby,This here is a radon test kit. Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. This is a radon test kit. Please don't throw these out. See them all over the office.
Michael,"Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks."
Michael,"Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite."
Jim,Ah.
Michael,Pfffffttt.
Pam,I don't think those were yours to take.
Toby,"Come on, Michael. You're interrupting."
Michael,"Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane."
Michael,"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?"
Andy,"I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior."
Toby,Please sit down.
Pam,Did you talk to him?
Michael,"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom."
Michael,I did.
Everyone,YEAH!
Pam,You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Michael,"Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice."
Kevin,Wow. That is crazy.
Everyone,No. No!
Phyllis,Was there a fistfight?
Jim,That's... not okay.
Michael,No. We just talked. He's very nice.
Michael,"Okay, alright."
Phyllis,And it didn't change your mind.
Dwight,"You were being really funny, and then you went too far."
Michael,It did not.
Michael,I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Phyllis,"Michael, that's awful."
Dwight,"No, hmmm... that's still..."
Michael,Isn't it?
Everyone,Mm-mm.
Phyllis,Yes.
Michael,"Okay geniuses, how would you do it?"
Michael,"I'm awful, aren't I?"
Creed,"Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted."
Kevin,Yeah. That's pretty bad.
Oscar,All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Michael,I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
Ryan,Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Oscar,How can you live with yourself?
Michael,I don't know.
Michael,"I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for."
Stanley,How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Kevin,"That is a dangerous game, friendo."
Jim,"Stanley, please, this is serious!"
Kelly,"Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store."
Angela,Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Ryan,I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
Michael,"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle."
Kelly,"'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?"
Dwight,"Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it"
Ryan,"All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, ""I read a book about anthropology."""
Toby,I don't wanna do this.
Kelly,I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Michael,"Toby, just do it! God!"
Ryan,I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Dwight,"Toby, come on."
Kelly,That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
Dwight,"Ready, one bullet. And boom!"
Michael,"I don't care. I have an appetite for life! Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon."
Everyone,"Yeah, that works. That works!"
Ryan,"Good for you, man. Good for you."
Michael,Good work.
Ryan,He takes what he wants.
Pam,What flavors did you get?
Ryan,"You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you."
Erin,It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Erin,What about Kelly?
Pam,Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Ryan,You read my mind.
Erin,Do you want me to go back to the store?
Erin,Is this a joke?
Pam,"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up."
Ryan,Yep.
Erin,This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Ryan,"It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold."
Pam,"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this."
Michael,"You'll learn, baby. You'll learn."
Erin,"After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me."
Dwight,"I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. Let's see what she gets. Aah!"
Pam,"Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this."
Creed,"Uh, boss, we're out of paper."
Erin,"That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though."
Michael,"Yeah, I noticed that."
Erin,We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Creed,Are you gonna add any more?
Pam,"And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up."
Michael,Nope.
Erin,He's coming.
Creed,"He don't give an ""F"" about nothin'!"
Pam,"Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay."
Michael,I have got big balls.
Toby,Hey everyone.
Pam,I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Pam,"No, out! Get out now! Leave now."
Jim,What about an energy drink or something?
Dwight,"Leave, get outta here."
Pam,"It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later."
Pam,Leave!
Jim,"Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it."
Dwight,Right now!
Pam,"Well, it does and it doesn't."
Pam,"Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?"
Darryl,"Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place."
Michael,Morning everyone.
Jim,A place?
Everyone,"Hey! Hey, hey!"
Darryl,A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Erin,Hi Michael.
Pam,You sleep in the warehouse?
Michael,Hello!
Darryl,"Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?"
Dwight,"Michael, nice tie or something."
Jim,Okay.
Michael,"Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think."
Darryl,Pam.
Kevin,That's hilarious.
Pam,Okay.
Pam,That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Phyllis,For your signature.
Michael,"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?"
Michael,"Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. Phyllis, look at-- okay, that's... All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna."
Kevin,Boi-oi-oi-ing
Kevin,Why not your condo?
Michael,Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
Michael,"Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate."
Lawyer,"I don't follow this exactly. Uh, ""The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..."""
Stanley,"Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind."
Dwight and Angela,Joint custody
Michael,"Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything."
Lawyer,Are we talking about your grandchildren?
Andy,Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
Angela,No.
Michael,Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
Dwight,No.
Dwight,I could have stopped him.
Angela,"Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract."
Dwight,Are you warmed up?
Dwight,Alleged contract.
Angela,No.
Angela,Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Dwight,"God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?"
Dwight,"Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it."
Angela,What did you do to yourself?
Dwight,"So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point ""B"", uh... the beet juice cleanse?"
Dwight,Never mind. Just never mind.
Angela,I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Angela,"Well, it better work."
Dwight,How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Dwight,"Oh, it'll work. Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract."
Angela,"Dwight, look at my teeth."
Michael,[driving in car
Dwight,Eughh.
Reporter,Michael Scott?
Andy,No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Michael,Yes?
Pam,Could he still be seeing her?
Reporter,Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
Phyllis,I don't think he'd do that.
Michael,"Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again."
Jim,So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Reporter,I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
Andy,"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big."
Michael,Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
Jim,Exactly. It happened in Big.
Michael,"No, I gotta go. Text me later."
Jim,I'm really too tired to do this.
Pam,Me too!
Jim,Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Pam,Hey Michael.
Michael,Hey.
Pam,"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby."
Jim,We can order in from Hooters.
Michael,"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice."
Pam,We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Jim,Billy Joel Rock Band.
Michael,That... exists?
Pam,Yes.
Michael,"Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer."
Pam,"Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?"
Michael,"Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions."
Phyllis,Oh Michael.
Michael,Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
Michael,"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong."
Meredith,That is something I would never do.
Michael,"Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith."
Meredith,"Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with."
Meredith,"I ask... everyone in the room, ""Are you in a relationship?""."
Michael,"People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers."
Kelly,"Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore."
Ryan,Okay.
Michael,"I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer."
Andy,How does he feel about it?
Michael,He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Jim,Now you're just being hurtful.
Michael,"I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat..."
Phyllis,Hey!
Michael,On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Andy,Did Donna tell you that?
Michael,Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
Andy,So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
Michael,You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Andy,"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage."
Andy,So... here's the thing about infidelity.
Michael,"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy."
Andy,How does that work?
Michael,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
Andy,"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce."
Michael,I am Beyonce always.
Andy,Not this time.
Michael,"Yes, I am."
Andy,"This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is."
Michael,I would love that.
Andy,Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
Michael,I have work to do.
Andy,"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss."
Michael,Let's go. I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
Andy,Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
Michael,"All right, Andy, please."
Andy,Baseball!
Michael,"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him."
Andy,Where?
Michael,Right there. The coach!
Andy,Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Michael,"Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?"
Andy,"And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain."
Michael,"All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?"
Andy,Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
Gabe,Guys?
Jim,Pam.
Pam,"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe."
Gabe,Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
Pam,You were supposed to be the Lookout.
Jim,"Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag."
Gabe,"I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad."
Jim,Sorry about that.
Pam,So embarrassing.
Gabe,"Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics."
Jim,"Well, you were surprisingly restrained."
Pam,We will be well-rested tomorrow.
Gabe,"Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else."
Jim,Excellent. Go for it.
Gabe,"I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?"
Jim,"Right? So, uh, let's uh..."
Lawyer,"Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button."
Angela,Same page. Go to the next one.
Dwight,Same page. Just keep moving.
Lawyer,Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
Dwight,Which we can't know.
Lawyer,This is essentially...
Dwight,Unless we're unplugged.
Lawyer,Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
Dwight,And wake up in the future.
Lawyer,Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
Dwight,What?
Lawyer,"Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else."
Angela,What?
Lawyer,"So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000."
Dwight,What?
Dwight,"I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it."
Andy,Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
Michael,You have no idea what you're talking about.
Andy,I know it's like cricket.
Michael,"You don't. No, no."
Andy,"And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket."
Michael,"You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, ""Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?"" ""High-five, Donna."" ""Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?"" ""Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit."""
Andy,Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Michael,"Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary."
Andy,You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Michael,"I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism."
Dwight,"$30,000? There's gotta be another way."
Angela,He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Dwight,"Look, I will not pay."
Angela,"Well, I have an alternative."
Dwight,"""Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"""
Lawyer,"Look, I don't think that's actually legal."
Dwight,Agreed.
Dwight,"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses."
Dwight,But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
Angela,"Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy."
Dwight,Fine. Five times.
Lawyer,"Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution."
Angela,I want eye contact.
Dwight,No.
Angela,Yes.
Dwight,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Angela,I'm not some farm animal.
Andy,"Great game, coach."
Michael,"Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't."
Andy,You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Shane,"Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys."
Andy,Ha. The other guys can go die.
Michael,Okay.
Andy,Baseball! Go talk to him.
Michael,No. God. You go talk to him.
Shane,Let's go.
Andy,Shane. Great game man!
Shane,Do I know you?
Andy,"No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us."
Shane,"Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads?"
Andy,Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball.
Shane,Okay.
Andy,"But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot."
Shane,Okay. Let's go!
Andy,Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Shane,Whoa!
Andy,"I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person."
Shane,"Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game."
Andy,"I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife."
Shane,Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this.
Andy,Of course.
Shane,All right.
Andy,"But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!"
Michael,"No, no, no."
Andy,"Come on, get over here."
Michael,"I'm good. Oh, my God."
Andy,"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach."
Michael,Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Shane,It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.
Michael,"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, ""I'm sleeping with your wife."" And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond."
Michael,"Okay, orange slices. There ya go."
Erin,"Thanks, Michael."
Michael,Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Oscar,Why would you throw something wet at me?
Michael,You love it. There ya go.
Jim,"Now, were those for the team?"
Michael,"There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. Michael Scott, as seen on TV."
Jo,Let me see what I can do.
Todd Packer,I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener... It's Packer!
Michael,"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!"
Michael,"Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough."
Michael,"Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site."
Oscar,What's number one?
Michael,"Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times."
Jim,"So instead of working, you want..."
Michael,Yes.
Jim,Okay.
Michael,Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
Angela,"Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!"
Phyllis,"Awww, it's kissing its mommy!"
Michael,Please.
Dwight,"Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever."
Michael,"Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. It's trying to stand up... there it goes."
Jo,Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Michael,Jo! We were not expecting you!
Jo,"'Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here."
Kevin,No.
Jo,"Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go."
Kevin,"Jo, I think that I know what happened."
Jo,"I'm not sure you do, teddy bear."
Kevin,"Well, now I think I might not."
Jo,"Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please."
Michael,"Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office."
Jo,Can you now?
Michael,"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand."
Phyllis,"Put your hand up, Norma Rae."
Andy,"If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets."
Andy,"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?"
Jo,"It's a little form, says ""I did not do it."""
Michael,"There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like..."
Jo,"All that's just birthday information, Michael."
Michael,"Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture."
Jo,"Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?"
Michael,Okay.
Jo,"When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one question"
Jo,"So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?"
Michael,"We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda."
Jo,"Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay."
Michael,"Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can."
Jo,"Well, I guess we're all right, Michael."
Michael,"I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right."
Jo,Yeah.
Michael,Okay.
Nick,Hey Dwight.
Dwight,"Hey, IT guy."
Nick,Mind if I get in there for a second?
Dwight,"Oh, sure thing, go ahead."
Nick,"Just one... Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?"
Dwight,"Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?"
Oscar,"The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother."
Dwight,"You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide."
Kevin,"Wait, are they searching all our computers?"
Nick,"Yeah. I already got to yours, Kevin."
Kevin,"No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner."
Angela,"Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!"
Michael,"Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers."
Phyllis,"Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy."
Jo,Okay Dwight.
Dwight,"Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... You should fire the following people."
Jo,"Well, I'm inclined to believe you."
Dwight,Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Jo,"Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?"
Dwight,Are you referring to alchemy?
Jo,"I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy."
Dwight,I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
Jo,"Well, buy property. That's my advice."
Michael,Is there something that you would like to say to me?
Andy,Uh...
Michael,About talking to the press?
Andy,"I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!"
Michael,Mmhmm.
Andy,"Okay? I, I... didn't do it."
Michael,I don't believe you.
Andy,I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
Michael,"That's a little much. All right, all right, all right."
Andy,"I don't care, that's how much I swear!"
Michael,"Okay, I believe you, I believe you."
Andy,I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Michael,Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
Darryl,"Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar."
Michael,"Oh, no, no, no..."
Darryl,"I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib."
Michael,Oh my god. Was she cute?
Darryl,No.
Michael,"Oh, god, Darryl!"
Michael,"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is."
Jo,Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
Toby,"Well, that's..."
Jo,And we didn't find anything on your computer.
Toby,Good.
Jo,Except this.
Toby,"Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on."
Jo,"I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?"
Toby,"Oh, uh, I don't know, uh..."
Jo,"The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder."
Toby,Oh... yes.
Toby,Write your own damn novel.
Pam,It was me.
Jim,What was you? You were the leak?
Pam,Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
Jim,Uh-huh.
Pam,"She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!"
Jim,Why'd you do that?
Pam,Her husband's a reporter.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,"So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do."
Jim,"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax."
Pam,I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
Jim,This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Michael,You leaked it?
Pam,"I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!"
Michael,"I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour."
Pam,That fast?
Michael,Oh.
Michael,Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
Pam,Yeah? I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Michael,So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
Pam,"Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it."
Pam,I have never seen so many parking tickets.
Darryl,"All right, this is just messed up."
Michael,"No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think."
Darryl,All right.
Michael,What do we got?
Pam,Um...
Kelly,"Hey guys, sorry I'm late."
Pam,We're not going for yogurt.
Michael,"It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew."
Kelly,"Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue."
Michael,"Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue."
Kelly,"Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof..."
Ryan,"Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. I just sent myself a Woof."
Erin,"Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1."
Ryan,"Thank you, Erin. Woof!"
Michael,"Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case."
Pam,Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
Michael,"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers."
Kelly,That idea sucks.
Pam,I don't think that's a good idea.
Michael,Just don't say no.
Darryl,"Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat."
Kelly,"Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl."
Michael,"That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just..."
Pam,"Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe."
Michael,Okay. You can count on me.
Dwight,Let me give you a hand.
Toby,I'm hungry.
Dwight,Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them
Realtor,"The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office."
Dwight,Basement office? You mean like a lair?
Michael,Hey Jo.
Jo,Michael.
Michael,"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it."
Jo,Michael Scott... what do you know?
Michael,What?
Michael,It doesn't matter what I know.
Jo,"If it doesn't matter, then tell me."
Michael,Why?
Jo,Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Michael,"Well, deal with this."
Jo,"Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak. Come with me."
Michael,What?
Gabe,"Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?"
Michael,Are you going to kill me?
Jo,Hahahahahaha.
Realtor,I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.
Dwight,Okay.
Realtor,"What time works for you? Mr. Schrute, what time works?"
Dwight,"Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it."
Realtor,But...
Michael,"Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police."
Creed,I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
Gabe,"All right. Uh, Stan, you're up."
Stanley,It wasn't me.
Gabe,"What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it."
Andy,What? Based on what?
Gabe,"Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?"
Dwight,All right. Sounds good.
Jim,"Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy."
Andy,"Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim."
Jim,Really?
Jo,Michael.
Michael,I have rights.
Jo,Let's just talk.
Michael,I am not going to tell you anything.
Jo,"Honey, you don't seem like your normal self."
Michael,"Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch."
Jo,Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Michael,"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down."
Jo,"Oh, I hate that."
Michael,"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly."
Jo,Who's Holly?
Michael,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
Kevin,"Well, I think that the real question is"
Dwight,"Oh, just..."
David Wallace,"I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it."
Andy,"Gabe, I told you all about the printers."
Jim,"I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point."
Pam,"Yes, it's totally obvious."
Creed,"I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. It's Angela. Get her, boys."
Nick,"Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers."
Gabe,"Uh, not now."
Nick,"Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would..."
Stanley,"Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?"
Phyllis,"I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I..."
Nick,My name is Nick.
Angela,"Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting."
Nick,"Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me."
Jim,"Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally."
Nick,"You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?"
Jim,No... sport.
Nick,"You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?"
Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and p0rn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch."
Nick,"Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? You're not a photographer. And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out."
Andy,You're going to believe that guy?
Jo,"When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me."
Michael,"Hmm, hmm."
Jo,"I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie."
Michael,"You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you."
Jo,"Oh honey, surely you don't want that."
Michael,"I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. You were playing too."
Dwight,"I'm about to buy this building, you know."
Hank,You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
Dwight,"Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace."
Andy,"Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?"
Phyllis,You deserve it.
Andy,"Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I..."
Kevin,"No, it does not!"
Andy,"Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either."
Angela,It does!
Erin,Andy?
Andy,Hey.
Erin,I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Andy,"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do."
Erin,Yeah.
Michael,"We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?"
Jo,"Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there."
Michael,That was fun.
Jo,I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Michael,Thanks. Today helped.
Jo,"Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life."
Michael,"Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua."
Stanley,You fallin' behind.
Ryan,Wuphf.com!
Kelly,"Ryan, we're doing the dance!"
Ryan,This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
Creed,You got Creed.
Ryan,#NAME?
Kelly,You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
Stanley,Still behind.
Angela,I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
Andy,"Go, go, go, go!"
Michael,
All,Streamers!
Dwight,Hiya! Ha!
Phyllis,Dwight!
Stanley,Are you crazy?
Andy,"Toby, how did we do?"
Toby,"Well, that was better."
Andy,Whoo! We did it!
Michael,"I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did."
Andy,"Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there."
Erin,"Yes, of course."
Andy,"And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher."
Erin,Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
Gabe,"Hey, guys."
Andy,Hey!
Gabe,"Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt."
Andy,Not at all.
Gabe,I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao.
Gabe,"I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite."
Erin,"Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great."
Andy,"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe."
Pam,Hey. What are you doing?
Dwight,"From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack."
Kevin,"Well, what if you're cold?"
Dwight,"Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy."
Jim,"Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear."
Dwight,"Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration."
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list."
Kelly,"This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, ""Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?"" And I'd be like, ""blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,"" giving you the exact right answer."
Luke,Coffee Monkey's arrived.
Oscar,The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Luke,"Here you go, Big O. Tiny. Darryl Hannah."
Darryl,It says decaf. You get me decaf?
Luke,"Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?"
Darryl,"My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him."
Andy,"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father."
Luke,My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints.
Andy,"That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael."
Michael,"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Ah! It's not cappuccino."
Oscar,He messed yours up to.
Darryl,"He's got to go, Mike."
Michael,"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?"
Jim,"Wow, that's a lot of keys."
Dwight,"The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man."
Jim,"That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back."
Dwight,Where?
Jim,I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.
Dwight,Give me that.
Jim,"Yep. Wait, and this."
Dwight,Yes.
Jim,Go get 'em.
Jim,"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life."
Dwight,"Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim."
Pam,Sorry.
Jim,"Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but..."
Pam,It was really funny.
Jim,"Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert."
Pam,I love you.
Phyllis,Luke? Luke!
Luke,"What's up, Venus?"
Phyllis,Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Luke,"Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe."
Meredith,"Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp."
Luke,You don't have to yell.
Michael,"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me."
Luke,What for?
Michael,To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
Michael,"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew."
Michael,"Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest."
Michael,Don't bother Luke.
Pam,Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Michael,"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?"
Phyllis,"Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke."
Michael,"No, it... Yes, okay, right. All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go."
Darryl,Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
Michael,"Come on. Okay, um... That's as clear as I can make it."
Phyllis,"Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it."
Michael,Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
Dwight,Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
Gabe,"That'd be hilarious. Uh, ""Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em."""
Michael,"Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke."
Dwight,How close?
Michael,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?"
Dwight,Yes. Of course.
Toby,"Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related."
Michael,"No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew."
All,What?
Michael,Luke is my nephew.
Oscar,"Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew."
Michael,"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing."
Darryl,What's wrong with a level playing field?
Michael,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
Jim,"Oh, man, so many points being made."
Creed,"I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat."
Michael,"God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son."
Erin,That's a really tight argument.
Michael,Thank you.
Jim,But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
Michael,"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?"
Oscar,This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
Michael,"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!"
Kelly,"I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you."
Oscar,"If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?"
Michael,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, ""Wow, he is so great."" And I was gonna say, ""Well, it's in the genes."" And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is."
Erin,Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Michael,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Kevin,"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?"
Pam,Or enough for everyone?
Luke,"No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips."
Oscar,"Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips."
Andy,"Clutch cream run, bro."
Pam,"Get whatever you want, on me."
Jim,You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Pam,I don't know. That usually works.
Pam,"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right."
Angela,I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
Michael,"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!"
Phyllis,"Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them."
Michael,"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store."
Jim,"Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, ""I don't own an Ebay store,"" so..."
Michael,"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project."
Oscar,"Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday."
Stanley,Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
Erin,"Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots."
Michael,I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
Andy,"You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A."
Michael,Wait a minute.
Meredith,I'm in.
Michael,"Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony."
Oscar,"Yep, here they are."
Phyllis,"Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time."
Andy,"This kid's costing us sales, Michael."
Erin,"I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see."
Michael,"No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit."
Jo,"Why is this my problem, Michael?"
Michael,Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
Gabe,"Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable."
Jo,"Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy."
Michael,You don't have all the facts.
Jo,Which are?
Michael,I love him.
Jo,"Oh, God. How far has it gone?"
Michael,No. No. He's my nephew.
Jo,"Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house."
Michael,"Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool."
Jo,"If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities."
Michael,I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Jo,"Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys."
Michael,"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other."
Kevin,"Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff."
Pam,"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses ""Doors closed"" the doors open. Or he presses ""lobby"" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?"
Kevin,Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Pam,Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
Dwight,"Hey, did you SMS text message me?"
Pam,"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on."
Dwight,"Okay, that's weird. Just hitting ""door closed."" What?"
Pam,There we go.
Dwight,"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol."
Pam,Let's just calm down.
Dwight,"Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately."
Pam,I don't-
Dwight,Use your talons! Pry 'em open!
Pam,"Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!"
Dwight,"Well, don't look, freak!"
Pam,"Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!"
Dwight,I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Pam,You've gotta be kidding me.
Michael,"Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!"
Luke,What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said.
Michael,Give me the pointer.
Luke,So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it.
Michael,"No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously."
Luke,"All right, fine. Fine. I'll just go."
Michael,Okay.
Luke,I'm gone.
Michael,"All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-"
Andy,"Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye."
Angela,"Michael, do something."
Meredith,"Sack up, man."
Michael,"Okay, can I have that?"
Luke,No.
Michael,"Ok, I am going to count down from five."
Both,"Five, four..."
Michael,I'm not kidding.
Both,"Three, two, one."
Michael,"Give-okay. Alright, give it up."
Luke,No!
Michael,"You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!"
Luke,What the?
Michael,"That's what you're going to do, Luke!"
Luke,What the hell was that?
Michael,I had to do that.
Luke,"Hey, this! Screw it!"
Michael,All right. Are we good? You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
Kevin,That was awesome!
Stanley,Texas justice.
Kelly,"Yeah, your nephew is so lame."
Creed,"He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean."
Jim,You follow him on Twitter?
Creed,Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
Gabe,"Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?"
Michael,"Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?"
Jim,Pam?
Pam,"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight."
Jim,I did not do this.
Pam,"I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video."
Jim,This is impressive.
Pam,"Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing."
Jim,Do they call you that?
Pam,They do call me that.
Jim,"Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down."
Pam,"Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor."
Jim,"Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?"
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,Great.
Dwight,How ya doin'?
Jim,Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Pam,Stop drinking the water! Stop!
Andy,"No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah."
Michael,"Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them."
Andy,Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
Gabe,Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
Michael,That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
Gabe,"Good. Well, that's the spirit."
Michael,I can do that.
Gabe,"And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors."
Michael,"Okay. Wait, what?"
Toby,"Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael."
Michael,Is there another option?
Gabe,The alternative is termination.
Dwight,Wow. Late every day this week.
Jim,What does that mean?
Pam,We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
Salesman,We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...
Dwight,Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Dwight,Good Morning!
Jim,Is there really?
Salesman,If he were in accordance with our dress policy.
Dwight,"Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea."
Dwight,What?
Dwight,Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
Salesman,But the blood stained hands...
Jim,Aaah!
Dwight,It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
Mose,Aaah!
Salesman,I'm very sorry.
Dwight,You remember my cousin Mose.
Dwight,Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
Mose,Welcome children.
Jim,Lets just go.
Pam,Were you painting in the dark?
Dwight,You made a big mistake. Huge!
Jim,Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
Jim,There it is. Alright.
Dwight,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Dwight,Aaah!
Pam,I don't really think we need...
Jim,That's pretty good.
Jim,Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
Andy,After you.
Pam,Yeah.
Dwight,I'll take the wizard!
Dwight,Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Salesman,"Oh, ok!"
Jim,These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
Michael,You forged them! You forged the forms!
Dwight,"Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork."
Toby,You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
Pam,And a soy sauce packet.
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
Toby,You remember that.
Jim,Don't beat yourself up.
Michael,"Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake."
Dwight,"We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success."
Toby,Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
Jim,Who will be watching the children?
Michael,"You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... ""I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!"" Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!"
Dwight,No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
Jim,Prove it.
Dwight,What?
Jim,"Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works."
Dwight,"Oh no, no, no."
Jim,"But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good."
Dwight,"I promise you, that door locks!"
Toby,What's something that you...
Michael,This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
Michael,"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell."
Toby,"Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here."
Michael,"I know what you want to ask me. ""Did your mom ever see you naked?"""
Toby,We can do this with more privacy.
Michael,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key."
Dwight,"Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!"
Phyllis,The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Dwight,"All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!"
Ryan,America is one big mall.
Jim,Did something happen Dwight?
Dwight,"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim."
Andy,"Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board."
Dwight,You don't want to know.
Toby,"I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons."
Phyllis,"I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid."
Pam,"Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes."
Jim,Pam?
Pam,"I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok."
Jim,Everything is going to be ok.
Pam,Tell me I'm good at sales.
Jim,You're good... you're good at sales.
Pam,"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair."
Andy,Dwight?
Dwight,What?
Andy,"Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the ""F"" word?"
Dwight,Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Stanley,No you will not.
Dwight,"Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're ""appearance""ists!"
Jim,"Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?"
Pam,"Yeah, what happened Dwight?"
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,"You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall..."
Pam,So what happened?
Dwight,"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms."
Kelly,"You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to ""Pretty Woman"" their asses."
Creed,We should start our own mall!
Erin,Yeah!
Jim,"Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly."
Kelly,What did I say?
Kelly,"I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out."
Jim,"Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson."
Andy,"No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you."
Dwight,Ok
Jim,Alright.
Andy,Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? How about now? How about now? How about now?
Toby,Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
Michael,One hour.
Toby,What?
Michael,"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today."
Toby,"Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk."
Michael,"No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time."
Toby,"Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly..."
Michael,"You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?"
Toby,Tell me!
Toby,I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
Michael,"Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby."
Dwight,"Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl..."
Andy,Pretty Woman.
Dwight,"Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this s*x worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?"
Jim,"No, no. I want to hear you tell it."
Dwight,"Ok, Um... The s*x worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the ""trappings"" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going..."
Andy,"Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,"" I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me."" And the shop girl goes, ""ok"". And Julia Roberts goes,"" You girls work on commission, right?"" And the girl is like,""Yeah"", and Julia Roberts goes..."
Kelly,"""Big mistake! Huge!"""
Andy,I was telling that... I was telling that.
Stanley,"How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure."
Window treatment guy,Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?
Erin,I don't know.
Window treatment guy,Is one of you the office administrator?
Pam,I am. I am the office administrator!
Window treatment guy,Can I show you a few samples?
Pam,"Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all."
Pam,There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
Michael,"Toby, can I really tell you anything?"
Toby,Of course.
Michael,"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my pen1s... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half."
Oscar,Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
Pam,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?"
Oscar,"Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!"
Pam,"Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?"
Oscar,"Totally, that's great."
Pam,"I get paid $40,000 per year."
Oscar,Great.
Pam,"Maybe $50,000."
Oscar,"$50,000?"
Pam,"No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500."
Oscar,That's great.
Jim,"Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman."
Andy,A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
Stanley,Is he still doing his boycott?
Jim,"No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?"
Kelly,You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
Jim,Agreed.
Dwight,Really?
Oscar,Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
Dwight,Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Ryan,The glasses are a little...
Pam,I liked them.
Kelly,I thought they were kind of cute.
Ryan,"Yeah, I liked them too."
Dwight,I can't see.
Darryl,"Say stuff like, ""Good morning, Good Afternoon"". People appreciate that."
Dwight,"Wait, I see you every day. Can I say ""Good month?"""
Darryl,I'm telling you how to do this man.
Andy,"If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you."
Angel,Please and thank you go a long way.
Dwight,Copy. Thank you.
Angela,Thank you.
Dwight,Please.
Andy,I think he's got it!
Michael,"And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?"
Toby,Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
Michael,"Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours. We're half way done."
Toby,Oh.
Pam,"Hey, do you have a second?"
Gabe,Yeah.
Pam,"Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over."
Gabe,"Right, of course!"
Pam,"And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you."
Gabe,Thank you so much.
Pam,I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
Gabe,Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
Pam,Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
Toby,"You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?"
Andy,
Jim,"We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute."
Phyllis,Go get 'em Dwight.
Jim,Wish us luck!
Dwight,Thank you.
Erin,Dwight
Erin,"Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today."
Toby,We can play something more complicated if you like.
Michael,This is plenty complicated.
Toby,So you have played it before?
Michael,I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
Toby,Who's Jeff?
Michael,"Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married."
Toby,"So, her husband, your stepdad?"
Michael,"Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though."
Toby,Did you guys do much stuff together?
Michael,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager."
Toby,It's working. I'm doing it!
Angela,
Dwight,What?
Angela,My place tonight. Wear this.
Dwight,Do you have your card?
Angela,Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
Toby,Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
Michael,"I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid."
Toby,Why?
Michael,I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
Toby,Dogs don't do that.
Michael,Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
Toby,I don't know.
Michael,"When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so..."
Toby,"It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?"
Michael,"Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok."
Toby,I'm just trying to help you Michael.
Michael,You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
Toby,I just want to...
Michael,You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
Toby,Just fill them out any way you want.
Michael,Ok.
Toby,I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
Michael,You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these and call me in the morning.
Pam,"Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to..."
Pam,"There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone."
Gabe,"So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?"
Toby,Yes.
Gabe,That is not how it seems to me.
Toby,He seems fine.
Gabe,"You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior."
Toby,Heh.
Darryl,I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
Pam,We can do that.
Darryl,Right in here?
Pam,Easily.
Gabe,"I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem."
Pam,But of course!
Gabe,Great.
Gabe,"The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator."
Pam,So weird that there is no paperwork.
Gabe,At all.
Pam,"Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America."
Gabe,"Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit..."
Pam,Admit what?
Gabe,I don't want to say it.
Pam,Say it.
Gabe,Mm-hmm.
Pam,"Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe."
Gabe,"Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment."
Pam,"Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle."
Gabe,Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
Pam,Sure. Anything else?
Gabe,Nope.
Pam,I'll get it right away.
Pam,The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2
Jim,Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
Dwight,It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Jim,"Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that."
Dwight,Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
Jim,That's it.
Salesman,Let me know if I can help you with anything.
Dwight,Excuse me sir.
Salesman,Yes?
Dwight,"I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me."
Salesman,"I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that."
Dwight,"You work on commission, don't you?"
Jim,"Stop, stop, stop."
Salesman,"No, we don't."
Jim,Did you just say you remember him?
Salesman,"Of course, but he looks much less threatening now."
Erin,Andy?
Jim,Yes!
Erin,Did you write this?
Andy,No.
Erin,Who did?
Andy,Steven Sondheim.
Erin,Who is he?
Angela,What the hell is happening?
Andy,We're the cast of Sweeney Todd
Michael,That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
Andy,Like a month ago.
Michael,Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
Andy,Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
Erin,I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
Andy,What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
Andy,"Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes."
Erin,"Oh, who else is going?"
Andy,Everyone.
Erin,Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
Andy,"What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?"
Michael,"Andy, what time's the show?"
Andy,8pm sharp.
Michael,How long is it?
Andy,Hour forty-five.
Michael,"Nope, can't make it."
Michael,"They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine."
Andy,"Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?"
Pam,"Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry."
Andy,Dwight?
Dwight,"Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap."
Andy,It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
Michael,"I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?"
Andy,"If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer."
Michael,Wow.
Andy,This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
Michael,"I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play."
Andy,Noishe!
Michael,And scene.
Angela,"Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight."
Dwight,"Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe."
Dwight,Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Dwight,Give me the punch card.
Angela,"No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show."
Dwight,That is not in the contract.
Angela,"Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?"
Dwight,"Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape."
Angela,Thank you.
Angela,"Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object."
Andy,"Hey, how are those salads?"
Jim,It's my own fault-
Andy,"My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could..."
Pam,We'll keep looking.
Andy,Yes!
Jim,Really?
Pam,"I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about."
Andy,"Oh my gosh, that would be amazing."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,For a lot of reasons.
Andy,"Yeah, I know. Neiche!"
Michael,"Oh, hey guys."
Stanley,You brought balloons to a play?
Michael,"I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers."
Phyllis,"It's nice, like Up."
Michael,Yes.
Usher,"Excuse me, are you the guy who did an entire Law & Order episode for his audition?"
Michael,Nope.
Andy,Guys?
All,Hey! Andy!
Andy,"You all made it, thank you so much."
Jim,"You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit."
Andy,She's babysitting?
Erin,"I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club."
Andy,"I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her."
Michael,This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
Darryl,"Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber."
Michael,"No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber."
Darryl,"No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition."
Michael,Are you kidding me?
Darryl,"Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later."
Michael,"All right, I'm sorry. God."
Usher,"Excuse me, I think you may be in the wrong seats."
Kelly,Ooooh!
Dwight,I work with that guy.
Angela,Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
Dwight,Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Angela,"Oh, Dwight, just move."
Dwight,His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
Kelly,What time is it?
Shelby,"Michael! Shelby Thomas Weemes, the director."
Michael,Hello.
Shelby,I promise you that if you keep auditioning with similar gusto...
Michael,Okay.
Shelby,We are going to find a production with a role for Michael Scott.
Michael,Okay.
Shelby,Yes?
Michael,Yes.
Shelby,Good.
Michael,Good.
Shelby,Enjoy the second act.
Michael,You enjoy the second act.
Shelby,Have a refreshment.
Michael,"Thank you. You, too."
Angela,"Come on, Dwight."
Dwight,Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Angela,These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
Dwight,Let's go.
Pam,"Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!"
Jim,Everything's fine.
Pam,We can relax.
Jim,We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
Meredith,Michael!
Andy,"Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute ""break a legs"" or ""I still love you"" type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall."
Creed,"Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph."
Andy,Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
Sweeney Todd,You found Johanna.
Andy,That monster of a judge has locked her-. Locked her away.
Sweeney Todd,There's a little bird fluttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping.
Michael,How is that funny?
Sweeney Todd,"The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off your... bird. Oh, for the love-turn your phone off! There are signs!"
Andy,"Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak."
Sweeney Todd,What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna?
Andy,"You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But..."
Sweeney Todd,Where is Johanna?
Andy,A madhouse.
Sweeney Todd,A madhouse?
Andy,"Yes, a madhouse."
Sweeney Todd,A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose all the wig makes of London go to obtain their human hair?
Andy,Do you think... so you think...
Sweeney Todd,"Fogg's Asylum , why not?"
Pam,Sounds like Cece.
Jim,"Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax."
Pam,"Oh, my God! Go, go!"
Jim,"Oh, my God."
Andy,That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
Erin,I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Jim,"Okay, this was pretty simple-"
Pam,Why are you here?
Jim,"Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed."
Pam,"What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way."
Erin,"I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything."
Jim,"Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or..."
Erin,"Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?"
Pam,You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Erin,"Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want."
Jim,"No, we're good. Thank you, though."
Erin,"Okay. Alright, bye Cece."
Pam,Okay.
Jim,"Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again."
Pam,Not together!
Michael,Boo! Boo!
Angela,That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
Dwight,All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Angela,Where's my car? Come on.
Michael,"Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots."
Sweeney Todd,Darryl?
Darryl,Hey!
Sweeney Todd,Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet?
Darryl,"Silent. Look, congratulations."
Sweeney Todd,Thank you.
Darryl,I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
Michael,"Yeah, good job. Well done."
Sweeney Todd,You're the guy who booed me.
Michael,"Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em."
Sweeney Todd,"No, I saw you, and you were the only one."
Michael,"Get your eyes checked, chucklehead."
Creed,"Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work."
Sweeney Todd,Thank you.
Darryl,You didn't have to boo him.
Michael,"Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling."
Darryl,How would you like it if we booed you?
Michael,That would never happen.
Darryl,Boo! Boo!
Michael,Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
Darryl,Boo! Boo!
Michael,I don't like that at all.
Andy,Are you ready?
Erin,"Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!"
Andy,Ah! Blood everywhere.
Erin,"Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work."
Andy,"Yeah, me, too."
Erin,"Okay, I kill you now."
Andy,Okay.
Dwight,"All right, let's do this."
Angela,"No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted."
Dwight,"It's okay, I smell."
Angela,"No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times."
Dwight,"No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have s*x."
Angela,"Well, I won't tell if you don't."
Dwight,"I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it."
Angela,"Good night, Dwight."
Dwight,Good night.
Andy,"These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here."
Erin,"This is awesome. Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise."
Andy,Awesome.
Erin,Okay.
Andy,See you later.
Erin,Thank you.
Jim,It's like The Hurt Locker!
Pam,This night was a disaster.
Jim,"No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream."
Pam,Yeah?
Jim,We could put that in orange juice.
Pam,Get it.
Jim,Yeah?
Pam,Let's get our juice on.
Jim,Yeah!
Phyllis,Found him!
Michael,"Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?"
Andy,"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
Michael,"Yeah, I get those every day after work."
Phyllis,"Your show was really great, Andy."
Stanley,Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
Andy,It was like amateur hour.
Oscar,"It was an amateur production, technically."
Michael,"Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome."
Andy,Stop just saying that.
Michael,"I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse."
Andy,Thank you. That feels good.
Michael,I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
Darryl,"Andy, sing us another song."
Andy,"Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now."
Phyllis,"Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight."
Michael,"Come on, Andy, seriously."
All,Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
Andy,"Okay, all right, all right, all right."
Andy,
Michael,"In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about."
Shelby,Thanks you.
Michael,"No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act."
Dwight,"Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! Que? QUE?"
Oscar,Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
Mexican Man,
Andy,"Well I'm not gonna use my pen1s, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway."
Son,We don't go with that man. I've seen several men go with that man and not come back.
Meredith,"Come on, give it a rest pencil dick."
Mexican Man,
Andy,I'm doing this for you Meredith!
Son,We've lost friends.
Meredith,I didn't want you it!
Mexican Man,
Andy,Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?!
Son,We don't know what he does with them.
Helene,It'll go away in time just don't touch it.
Mexican Man,
Michael,Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
Son,I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Helene,What did you think we were?
Dwight,"I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada."
Michael,"Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you..."
Nate,Hola amigo.
Helene,"I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly."
Dwight,"Hola, tu es une buena worker?"
Michael,Jerk.
Nate,"Si, yo muy bueno worker."
Dwight,Michael!
Dwight,"Y el accento, donde are you from?"
Carroll,"So this is the chef's kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers."
Nate,"Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia."
Michael,"Real entertainers, like Billy Joel."
Dwight,You speak English?
Carroll,Michael.
Nate,"Yes, I'm really good at English."
Michael,"Carroll, how are you?"
Dwight,"Ok, good. Me too, get in the car."
Carroll,I'm great! How are you?
Nate,Okay.
Michael,"I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her."
Dwight,
Carroll,You didn't call my office and ask where I was?
Angela,Who's this guy by our cars?
Michael,No.
Dwight,"That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about."
Carroll,Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.
Phyllis,"Yeah, I got stung up my dress."
Michael,Weird...
Dwight,Poor hornet.
Carroll,Yeah.
Dwight,I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
Michael,He sounds like a nice guy.
Ryan,But if he doesn't?
Andy,"I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith."
Dwight,He'll die.
Gabe,This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
Kelly,What?
Andy,How is that relevant to anything?
Andy,"Uhh, beg your pardon?"
Gabe,"I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way."
Dwight,When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Andy,The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
Nate,
Gabe,"I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you."
Kelly,Is that a blow torch?!
Michael,Oh wow another living room!
Pam,No. No no no!
Carroll,It's a family room.
Dwight,Interesting choice...
Michael,"You put the TV here, you put the family over here."
Pam,Yes!
Carroll,Michael why are you here?
Andy,Very very smart.
Michael,Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
Pam,"Yeah, go away."
Carroll,"You know, we all do that."
Nate,
Michael,I have herpes.
Employees except Dwight,No! No no!
Carroll,What? Did you have that while we were together?
Dwight,A bat! Impressive...
Michael,"I just found out today. It's, uh, right there."
Andy,Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow!
Carroll,"Oh! Oh, that's what you're talking about?"
Michel,"Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?"
Michael,"Mmhmm, I'm sorry."
Erin,Terrific!
Carroll,Did the doctor check it out?
Michael,There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
Michael,I'm between specialists right now.
Phyllis,God! Wow!
Carroll,"Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date."
Michael,"Look, It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive."
Michael,Well I believe in love at first sight.
Phyllis,That's no pimple Michael.
Carrol,"Well so do I, but we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking!"
Michael,You mean cancer?
Michael,"I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous."
Pam,"What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer."
Dwight,"Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?"
Pam,It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Carroll,No.
Meredith,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore."
Darryl,"We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?"
Michael,It is?
Andy,No I'm just sweating.
Meredith,"Yup, just a cold sore."
Darryl,I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
Michael,"Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it."
Andy,I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
Kevin,I know how you got it.
Darryl,"Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self."
Michael,How?
Andy,Ok.
Kevin,Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Darryl,Yeah.
Michael,What?
Darryl,"I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?"
Pam,"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is."
Holly,"This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up."
Meredith,I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Michael,"Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye."
Kevin,I never seen herpes on you.
Oscar,What is this about?
Meredith,"Because it's on my genitals, genius."
Michael,"Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?"
Kevin,You have a pen1s?
Oscar,Yes!
Andy,"Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?"
Michael,You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
Michael,Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Oscar,What?
Jim,"That was like, ten years ago."
Michael,Herpes duplex.
Michael,No! It was like four years ago!
Dwight,It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Kevin,"Michael, you're at least forty six!"
Michael,I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
Michael,Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six.
Oscar,We were never lovers!
Kelly,Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
Dwight,"I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had s*x with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms..."
Angela,This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
Michael,"Flower shops, fireworks celebrations..."
Andy,"You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance."
Dwight,Fence with a hole in it..
Kelly,I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
Michael,"Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park..."
Oscar,I don't even wanna know these things!
Dwight,"The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home."
Meredith,Hey guys!
Michael,An electric car dealership.
Michael,"How did this happen, how did I get this?"
Dwight,"The democratic primaries,"
Dwight,"Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it."
Michael,Oscar! Think abou- Think!
Michael,"You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port."
Dwight,What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Michael,Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
Dwight,You may have...
Michael,Oh my God! What if I did?
Dwight,"You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes."
Michael,Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Dwight,"You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do."
Michael,There's no way I'm gonna do that.
Dwight,Then I will.
Michael,
Dwight,"No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge."
Donna,Hello?
Michael,Hi Donna. It's Michael.
Donna,"Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?"
Michael,"I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me."
Donna,Oh no.
Michael,I can't even say it. H-I...
Donna,Oh my God.
Michael,...R-P-E-E-S
Donna,"Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?"
Michael,"No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?"
Donna,"Ummm, no."
Michael,Does your stupid husband have it?
Donna,No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
Michael,Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Dwight,So long Donna!
Andy,"Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?"
Stanley,Not again...
Andy,What do you mean again?
Stanley,You're always asking for our attention.
Andy,Maybe like a year ago...
Stanley,Seems recent.
Andy,"No, that's..."
Oscar,"Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions."
Andy,"Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices."
Phyllis,"Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention."
Stanley,"That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores."
Andy,It's the world's only international sport!
Holly,This is Holly.
Michael,No this is Holly.
Holly,No this is Holly.
Michael,No this is Holly.
Holly,"No, this is Michael Scott."
Michael,Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
Holly,"I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!"
Michael,Oh really? Was anyone killed?
Holly,A lot of people.
Michael,Any nuns?
Holly,"Three nuns, from a Missionary in South Africa."
Michael,Were they in the missionary position?
Andy,"Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break."
Michael,Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
Holly,Yeah.
Michael,We would have twins.
Holly,I don't think we'd have kids.
Michael,Mmhmm!
Holly,It was just for a few weeks!
Michael,Mhhmm! We would be married.
Holly,"Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know."
Michael,Do what?
Holly,You romanticize things.
Michael,I don't romanticize th- No...
Holly,"Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up."
Michael,"He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation."
Holly,You made ourselves to be more than we were.
Michael,We were more than we were.
Holly,"I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory."
Michael,"Ok, alright I gotta go."
Holly,Michael...
Dwight,He forgot to mention the herpes.
Michael,It didn't come up organically.
Jan,"...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to..."
Jan,"How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you."
Michael,It's nice to see you doing so well.
Jan,"Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom."
Michael,Bringing home the bacon.
Jan,Yeah. Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... I love that commercial.
Dwight,I don't understand the reference.
Jan,"Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call."
Dwight,"We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you."
Jan,Are you gonna keep me in suspense?
Michael,Would you excuse us...
Dwight,"Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it."
Michael,He hasn't changed.
Jan,"No, so what couldn't wait?"
Michael,Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
Jan,"Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem."
Michael,What?
Jan,"You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in."
Andy,"So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia."
Erin,Andy...
Andy,"What, is it because he's black?"
Jim,"Nope, it's because it's genitalia."
Andy,Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia.
Jim,Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Andy,"It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's."
Jan,No! In the beginning we were not good.
Michael,"Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!"
Jan,Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
Michael,Because we work together.
Jan,"No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!"
Michael,Am I the princess?
Jan,"No I'm the princess, and the queen."
Michael,"Ok, so I'm the guy at the station."
Astrid,Mommy!
Jan,Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
Astrid,It was cool.
Jan,What did you learn?
Astrid,What did I learn?
Jan,"You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers."
Michael,I have herpes.
Michael,I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
Andy,"Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of s*x. Can anyone else name any other consequences?"
Kevin,It feels unbelievable!
Andy,Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
Kevin,...unbelievable.
Phyllis,The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Andy,"Express love, magical."
Kevin,It feels amazing!
Andy,"Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?"
Kevin,Yes.
Andy,Then I will write it down.
Creed,The feeling of pure risk.
Andy,"I actually had that down in the cons column, but..."
Creed,It's thrilling.
Andy,"Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk."
Erin,"Andy, aren't there also negatives to s*x?"
Andy,Yes! Thank you! Such as?
Erin,Unplanned pregnancy.
Andy,"Yes, unplanned pregnancy."
Kelly,"Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?"
Kevin,Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Pam,Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Jim,Good!
Darryl,"I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros."
Jim and Pam,Thank you!
Andy,"Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column."
Dwight,"Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you."
Michael,"You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She..."
Dwight,Jan knows paper.
Michael,"No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there."
Dwight,"Wait, what Holly said?"
Michael,"Yes, I don't..."
Dwight,Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Michael,"I know, I know."
Dwight,"Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay."
Michael,Got it.
Dwight,"TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!"
Michael,I'M TRYING! GOD!
Michael,Hi stranger! Long time!
Old Woman,Who are you?
Michael,I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
Old Woman,I don't think so...
Helene,Michael?
Michael,"Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?"
Dwight,Come on old lady. Let's go.
Old Woman,What is happening?
Dwight,Come on.
Andy,Who can tell me what the safest form of s*x is?
Darryl,Condoms.
Andy,"Incorrect, the only true form of safe s*x, ok? Abstinence."
Darryl,Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski!
Andy,I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody?
Pam,Andy that's way too personal of a question.
Andy,"Well someone could answer if they want to. Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil."
Andy,What?
Michael,Look at that.
Dwight,Then make him pitch to you.
Oscar,Huh?
Jim,Yes.
Michael,Nice!
Dwight,We gotta see what he's got.
Oscar,"I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning."
Jim,Exactly. You can do this.
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,"Okay, and remember-you're not gay."
Michael,She is a beaut!
Jim,Stop it! It's gonna be great.
Dwight,Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Oscar,Okay.
Oscar,"Yes, it is."
Jim,"And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it."
Michael,"Oh, look at that. Smooth roll."
Oscar,"Meredith, I-"
Oscar,Yeah.
Meredith,"Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English."
Kevin,You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
Danny,Hola. Que tal?
Oscar,Yes.
Oscar,"Como estas, senor?"
Meredith,His ass was on that seat? All right!
Meredith,"Uh, Manuel, cleano el window."
Kevin,Nice.
Jim,Who else we got?
Oscar,"No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses."
Dwight,Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Kelly,"I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now."
Ryan,Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Pam,Michael!
Jim,Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
Michael,"Oh, god!"
Michael,Don't let us down.
Oscar,Oh...
Ryan,Will do. Won't do.
Michael,"Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike."
Danny,"Yeah, sure."
Jim,Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
Meredith,"You smell like a Scorpio. This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro."
Michael,"I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. Mi-chael! Mi-chael!"
Danny,"You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-"
All,Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
Meredith,"Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-"
Dwight,Yeah!
Michael,"No, no, no...."
Pam,"Come on, Michael! Yeah!"
Jim,"No, no, no, no..."
Jim,Just steer more now.
Michael,I'm goin 'in!
Michael,"Oh, my god!"
Dwight,"Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!"
Pam,Not the car!
Michael,"Stop, stop! Oh, my god! Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop."
Jim,No! No!
Danny,Michael Scott.
Michael,Ow! You never forget. Whoo!
Michael,"I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-"
Dwight,How do I look?
Meredith,Please to meet you-
Jim,Amazing. How do I look?
Michael,"Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever."
Dwight,Normal. Ugly.
Danny,Hmm.
Jim,"Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go."
Michael,"I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you."
Dwight,"Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after."
Danny,But from where?
Dwight,"We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash."
Michael,A surveillance room next to this one.
Jim,He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Danny,"Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?"
Dwight,Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Michael,Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
Jim,I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
Danny,Or...crazy.
Dwight,"And who is this ""the"" Steve Nash?"
Michael,Well-
Jim,Phoenix Sun's point guard?
Danny,I'm gonna go.
Dwight,No.
Michael,"Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well."
Jim,No? Nothin'?
Dwight,No!
Dwight,"No, Mr. Jock Hipster."
Jim,"No, no, no, no."
Jim,"Well, I'm neither of those things, so..."
Danny,"Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here."
Andy,"Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!"
Michael,"No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks."
Phyllis,What? Is Dan okay?
Danny,"What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that!"
Andy,"No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy"
Michael,"You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me."
Phyllis,Yes.
Danny,"Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy."
Andy,"""Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.'"""
Michael,"So, you will?"
Phyllis,"Oh, that's great news for your friend."
Danny,No!
Andy,"Yeah, yeah, it's great..."
Michael,"Hold it, hold it. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?"
Phyllis,"You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder."
Danny,Get out of my way.
Andy,"I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh."
Michael,"Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?"
Dwight,Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
Danny,"I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now."
Jim,"Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight..."
Michael,"I know, I know."
Dwight,Crap.
Danny,I'm very upset!
Dwight,Danny Cordray is the worst.
Michael,"Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?"
Jim,"Well, by worst, you mean the best."
Danny,More freedom.
Dwight,"The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone."
Michael,"I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?"
Jim,"So, the situation is the worst."
Michael,"Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!"
Dwight,"Also, he slept with Pam."
Kelly,me!
Jim,"No, he didn't."
Michael,"O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?"
Jim,Tell 'em.
Kelly,Josh Duhamel.
Pam,Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
Angela,"Yeah, I can see that."
Jim,What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
Michael,No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
Pam,"That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle."
Kevin,He's like a better-looking Andy.
Jim,"Yeah, I thought you started it."
Andy,"Thanks, Kevin."
Pam,"No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. You know I have a kid with you, right?"
Michael,"No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me."
Jim,Ahhh.
Oscar,"It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it."
Dwight,I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
Dwight,Michael?
Jim,"Okay, great-"
Michael,Yes.
Dwight,Watch this.
Dwight,Can I talk to you about something?
Jim,-I'm just gonna watch.
Michael,"No, you may not."
Dwight,"So anyway, she says, ""that is the biggest pen1s I have ever seen."" And I said, ""I know. That's why I brought you to the pen1s Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars."" Well, hello Danny!"
Dwight,It's about this very announcement you just made.
Danny,"Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey."
Michael,I said no.
Jim,How are ya?
Dwight,Michael-
Danny,Good to see you too.
Michael,We're not-
Dwight,What are you doing?
Jim,"Michael, I think you really want to talk to him."
Danny,"Oh, I'm just here for the coffee."
Michael,"Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. Don't leave. Don't let him."
Dwight,Like hell you are.
Erin,Gotcha.
Jim,Dwight!
Jim,You hired him?
Dwight,"He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!"
Michael,"Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?"
Michael,"Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?"
All,Stay the same.
Jim,"Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?"
Michael,"Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better."
Michael,"Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?"
Phyllis,It's not gonna get better
Angela,What?
Michael,"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us"
Oscar,You are busy! We're in a meeting!
Dwight,Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
Michael,"It's Jim, Okay? Yes."
Michael,"He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave."
Jim,"Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here."
Stanley,Hmpf!
Michael,"You need the big guns, yes?"
Dwight,Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Jim,Yes.
Michael,Good-bye!
Dwight,What'd he say? What did he say?
Darryl,Song's about truth.
Jim,The big gun thing. Stop!
Kevin,Yeah.
Michael,"I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in."
Darryl,What's something you really care about?
Pam,"You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager."
Andy,Reverse snobbery.
Michael,"No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?"
Darryl,More universal.
Pam,You don't?
Andy,Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
Michael,No! Okay. All right.
Darryl,Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
Andy,"Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock"
Kevin,"Oh, nice!"
Darryl,I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
Andy,Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
Andy,"Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com."
Darryl,Go ahead.
Darryl,"If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?"
Andy,Which me am I gonna be today?
Andy,I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
Darryl,Which me am I gonna be today?
Darryl,Nah. I play for pleasure.
Andy,I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
Andy,This is for pleasure.
Kevin,Or the me that stinks.
Darryl,I wouldn't enjoy that.
Andy,"Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?"
Andy,I'm willing to pay you.
Darryl,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Darryl,"Oh, yeah?"
Andy,Wait. Seriously?
Andy,Yeah.
Darryl,Yeah.
Darryl,How much?
Andy,"So we're just, like, jamming as friends?"
Andy,Sixty bucks a session.
Darryl,"One, two, three, hit it."
Darryl,That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
Andy,Closet full of mes-
Andy,Yes!
Danny,"Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates."
Dwight,There he is.
Jim,Did ya?
Michael,"Oh, no, that's a male model."
Danny,"Yeah. Way ,way, way back."
Jim,"No, that's him."
Jim,I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
Michael,"That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company."
Danny,Oh. She was not into me.
Danny,"Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper."
Jim,Oh.
Michael,Nice to meet you.
Danny,Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Danny,Three of you guys for one sale.
Dwight,You snubbed her.
Michael,"Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?"
Jim,"Dwight, please."
Danny,"Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right."
Dwight,"Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too ""meh"" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!"
Michael,All right.
Danny,Okay...that's different.
Danny,It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Dwight,"Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. So...you're gonna be workin' here?"
Michael,Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
Danny,Uh...I mean-yeah.
Receptionist,He's ready for you.
Dwight,Welcome aboard.
Michael,"Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--"
Danny,Thank you.
Jim,"Nope, not doing that."
Jim,"Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?"
Dwight,I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Dwight,It's after 5
Michael,"Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then."
Danny,Oh.
Jim,Showtime!
Dwight,Pleasure.
Michael,It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
Danny,Thanks.
Michael,"When I knock on your door, you know who it is"
Michael,"This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer."
Steve,"Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company."
Kevin,"Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?"
Michael,"You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends."
All,"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you."
Steve,"That's very generous, but-"
Darryl,I'll be your croak monsieur.
Michael,"And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now."
Andy,I'll be your croak madame.
Dwight,He's not kidding.
Kevin,"Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog."
Michael,"Shake it, shake it!"
Darryl,I find you absolutely ribbiting!
Steve,"Michael, I'm going with Danny."
All,"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love."
Dwight,Oh.
Andy,"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love."
Steve,Thanks for coming in.
Kevin,Croak!
Michael,Okay. Thank you.
Andy,Ribbit!
Steve,Thank you.
Darryl,Scoopity-splash!
Michael,"Thanks, Steve."
Kevin,Nice.
Dwight,Jim talked too much.
Jim,"No, I didn't."
Dwight,"Yes, you did."
Michael,"Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?"
Michael,"How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned."
Michael,"You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?"
Stanley,We sell better?
Michael,"Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?"
Stanley,I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Michael,"Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?"
Stanley,Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
Michael,"I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?"
Phyllis,I could try to seduce him.
Michael,"Oh, my god!"
Dwight,I know how we can learn his tricks.
Dwight,What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Jim,Is that your office?
Dwight,"Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell."
Phyllis,Uh...
Stanley,I'm outta here.
Phyllis,This is weird.
Michael,You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Jim,A what?
Michael,Like the movie.
Jim,I think you mean The Sting.
Michael,"Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers."
Jim,Nope. Different movie.
Dwight,The Sting. The Sting.
Erin,Your two o'clock.
Meredith,"Thanks, hun."
Jim,Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
Danny,Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
Meredith,Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Jim,Meredith Van Helsing?
Dwight,Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Jim,Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Michael,Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
Jim,"You know this isn't real TV, right?"
Michael,Yes.
Darryl and Andy,"Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl."
Andy,Please Mr. President-
Darryl,"One second, one second, one second. So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?"
Andy,Yeah.
Darryl,But you're singing it.
Andy,"Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto."
Darryl,"No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song."
Andy,"Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul."
Darryl,"Oh, I never sing with soul."
Andy,That's a lie.
Kevin,I could sing it.
Andy,I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
Kevin,But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Andy,"Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-"
Danny,"I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here."
Meredith,Hel-lo!
Michael,"Oh, no, no. No. Don't-"
Dwight,"People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire."
Michael,Testify.
Jim,"Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-"
Michael,"Yeah, he is that good-looking."
Dwight,"He's very, very handsome."
Michael,Okay.
Meredith,That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? Sorry. Yeah?
Michael,"Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him."
Meredith,I'm sorry. You're here to sell me some paper.
Danny,"Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit."
Meredith,What do you mean?
Michael,Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
Andy,Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
Oscar,It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
Andy,But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
Pam,Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
Andy,"I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics."
Ryan,I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
Andy,Rude. And not helpful.
Creed,"Well, I really, really, really liked it."
Andy,"Well, that...really bums me out."
Creed,You're welcome.
Danny,"We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?"
Meredith,Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Danny,"Ha ha, okay, there you go!"
Michael,Stay-
Meredith,"Shut up and let me do this! You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?"
Danny,"I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?"
Dwight,Oh...
Danny,"Well, we'll get this..."
Michael,Oh!
Dwight,"Oh, man!"
Meredith,"So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too."
Jim,We gotta get someone else in there right now.
Jim,You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
Oscar,That sounds fake.
Jim,What do you mean?
Dwight,"I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-"
Jim,"Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?"
Oscar,Okay.
Jim,So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Oscar,All right. I can do that. Then what?
Andy,"What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now."
Gabe,"In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me."
Jim,I don't know. Oh! That's... not... yours.
Michael,Thank you.
Jim,"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?"
Darryl,You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
Stanley,What's a seven letter word for purse?
Gabe,"Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open."
Kevin,"[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis"
Michael,"If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!"
Stanley,Nope. Starts with an H.
Darryl,You said no to this one!
Andy,Handbag.
Michael,"That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?"
Stanley,Hmmm. Thank you.
Darryl,What have you done for me?
Andy,Shh! Shhh!
Michael,Oh...
Michael,"All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!"
Darryl,What have you done for me?
All,Yay!
Michael,Well...
Stanley,"Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow"
Darryl,Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
Pam,"Bye, Stanley! Love you!"
Gabe,"Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? This really make you think, Michael?"
Dwight,"So long, Stanley!"
Michael,"Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it."
Stanley,"Night, everybody."
Gabe,Yeah.
Oscar,"So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?"
Michael,"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide."
Kevin,"The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore."
Darryl,I don't understand the point of a hat.
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?"
Gabe,"You're right, we don't need a hat."
Michael,"A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! Six seconds, MacGruber! Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! Uh, two seconds MacGruber! Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! MACGRUBERRRR!"
Michael,I am not budging on the hat issue.
Pam,"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!"
Gabe,"Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period."
Jim,Stop.
Michael,Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
Dwight,"Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me."
Gabe,"Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo."
Jim,Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
Michael,"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call."
Dwight,To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Darryl,Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
Pam,What?
Michael,Sorry I was a jerk.
Dwight,You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Michael,Friends fight. Friends fight.
Pam,"I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on."
Andy,"What's up, man?"
Jim,I am Popeye!
Darryl,"Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?"
Jim,"I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number ...no."
Andy,"When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards."
Gabe,In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... we will be reviewing our sales policies. I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
Darryl,This was your freshman year.
Michael,MACGRUBER!
Andy,"I started to ask myself, ""Do I have big plans here?"" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School."
Todd Packer,Lame. Why don't witches wear panties?
Darryl,No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
Michael,"Oh, here we go!"
Jim,"To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?"
Todd Packer,Because they need to grip the broom!
Pam,"Oh, wow!"
Michael,OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
Jim,Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.
Dwight,Lake Erie.
Pam,"Aww, my hero!"
Gabe,"When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales."
Pam,"Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez."
Michael,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?"
Kelly,"If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me."
Gabe,That is correct.
Ryan,Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
Todd Packer,"Has anyone started calling you ""Gabe-wad"" yet?"
Creed,"Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good."
Gabe,Not here.
Danny,Gabe-wad.
Gabe,"Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-"
Michael,Blackula!
Darryl,Dracula.
Michael,"Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had."
Darryl,Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
Michael,"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man."
Darryl,I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
Michael,Really? We're good?
Darryl,Yeah. We're cool.
Michael,Okay. Okay.
Darryl,What's under your shirt?
Michael,Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
Michael,Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
Toby,"It's a great stick, right?"
Ryan,It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
Toby,Thanks!
Oscar,"Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?"
Toby,No.
Ryan,No.
Kelly,I get that. I get that.
Danny,"Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar."
Kevin,You own a bar?
Danny,"Public School, at exit 11."
Oscar,That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Danny,So. You're all on the list!
Ryan,"Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys."
Creed,"Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?"
Danny,Okay.
Kevin,I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Phyllis,"I don't know, they're both handsome."
Dwight,Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Phyllis,I think he-
Creed,"Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam."
Jim,"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us."
Pam,We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
Jim,That's right.
Pam,Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
Jim,Yikes.
Pam,But I've learned to love again. He's a cartoon sailor.
Jim,"Oh, no."
Pam,And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Jim,"No. No, I'm not gonna-no."
Andy,Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
Jim,I don't care.
Kevin,I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Andy,You know what else? The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties.
Kevin,"Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe."
Andy,Creed's going?!
Jim,Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
Michael,Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
Darryl,Hello?
Michael,"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please."
Darryl,I'm good.
Michael,"You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!"
Darryl,"This is embarrassing, Michael."
Michael,"Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed."
Darryl,Let me put my shoes on.
Pam,"Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it."
Michael,This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
Angela,"So, what happened?"
Michael,"I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now..."
Erin,Oh!
Michael,And we are going to straighten this out.
Andy,Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
Michael,Mmhm!
Gabe,"Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned."
Michael,I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
Dwight,He went to Gabe behind your back.
Michael,"No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head."
Dwight,He went over your head to go behind your back.
Michael,What is taking someone from behind?
Dwight,"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous."
Michael,"It was a good idea, though."
Dwight,Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
Andy,"Hey, Danny."
Danny,Hey.
Andy,"I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight."
Danny,I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
Andy,You were?
Kevin,"Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween."
Danny,For sure.
Andy,"We're just like, totally caught in the middle here."
Danny,What are you talking about?
Andy,Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
Danny,Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
Kevin,They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
Danny,I'll talk to them.
Kevin,"Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you."
Danny,Okay.
Kevin,Or you're dead.
Danny,Okay.
Kevin,Okay.
Erin,Kelly! Great costume!
Toby,Oh.
Angela,"KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out."
Kelly,"Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination."
Oscar,Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Kelly,"Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar."
Angela,"Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?"
Angela,"This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book."
Dwight,"Garbage magnet. Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!"
Michael,What the hell are they talking about?
Dwight,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique."
Michael,"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?"
Kevin,I am so sorry.
Michael,"Oh, you're sorry?"
Kevin,I just thought-
Michael,What did you just thought?
Kevin,"Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-"
Michael,All right.
Kevin,I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Michael,Okay.
Kevin,Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Michael,"Well, don't let it happen again."
Kevin,You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
Michael,I-
Kevin,"you, Gabe!"
Gabe,Okay...
Danny,Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
Jim,That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
Danny,"Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history."
Pam,"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history."
Danny,Exactly.
Jim,It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
Danny,No! Two or three dates.
Pam,It was two.
Danny,Was it two? I thought it was three.
Pam,"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so..."
Jim,Oooh! You can't handle the truth!
Danny,"Well, that does not sound like me."
Pam,"Yeah? It was though, that's what happened."
Danny,"Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird."
Pam,Hmm-mm.
Michael,"Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other."
Darryl,I'm not mad. Are you mad?
Michael,You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Darryl,"Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you."
Michael,"Okay, that might help. If you said ""I'm sorry"" in front of everybody."
Darryl,Mike.
Michael,In front of me.
Darryl,You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
Michael,So that's it.
Darryl,That's it.
Michael,Is it?
Darryl,Yes.
Andy,"Sookehhh. Bill Compton, from True Blood."
Stanley,How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
Oscar,I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Phyllis,Oh.
Oscar,Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Ryan,"Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line."
Pam,"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself."
Kevin,Pam. Can you vote for other people?
Michael,"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!"
Michael,Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
Pam,"Michael, this is a bad idea."
Michael,What's a bad idea?
Pam,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?"
Michael,"NEVER! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl."
Kelly,Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
Stanley,Raaah!
Oscar,"I present to you the rational consumer, as it were."
Pam,Angela as the nurse!
Angela,"I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office."
Phyllis,What should we ask?
Michael,"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?"
Jim,We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Erin,He says no.
Michael,Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
Darryl,No.
Michael,"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?"
Dwight,Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Dwight,"I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth."
Michael,If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
Erin,A... S... S... H... E... T?
Phyllis,An asset!
Erin,Ah! That's enough.
Danny,I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
Todd Packer,I don't think you get it.
Danny,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Danny,"This is some party, huh?"
Jim,"When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?"
Danny,Are you serious?
Jim,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is..."
Danny,"You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and..."
Jim,Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
Todd Packer,"Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?"
Jim,Nope.
Danny,Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Ryan,Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
Meredith,"Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile."
Oscar,ERIN!
Erin,Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
Pam,I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
Jim,Just tell her the real reason.
Danny,Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Jim,Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
Pam,"I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like ""gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why."""
Danny,Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
Jim,"Hey, man."
Pam,"Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? Okay. Well, excuuuuse me."
Pam,"I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat."
Pam,Did you lose Cece?
Kelly,I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
Jim,"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did."
Michael,"That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-"
Michael,Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
Jim,Stop.
Andy,I can make myself cry.
Michael,"Um... kay. Uh, alright."
Michael,Do that. Do it.
Pam,One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Andy,"Should I-I got it. I got it. Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view."
Erin,Di-Did you say vampire?
Bus driver,Can't stop. We're on a schedule.
Pam,"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this."
Andy,"Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road."
Dwight,Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? 'Cause of the euro.
Bus driver,Maybe we'll stop in Tennesseee. It's not safe to talk to a driver.
Pam,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick."
Michael,"Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on."
Dwight,Uh...
Bus driver,Stopping in Tennessee.
Pam,"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office."
Guy,"Hey, is there a problem, you guys?"
Dwight,"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life."
Michael,"Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please."
Jim,Elaborate.
Guy,Why?
Dwight,"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter..."
Andy,Just make him stop the freaking bus!
Pam,I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
Michael,"Stop the bus, okay?"
Dwight,Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Carla,"Are you okay, sir?"
Jim,"So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you."
Michael,"I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take."
Dwight,Yes. I would welcome it.
Girl,You have plenty left to give. You're doing-
Jim,You're welcome.
Michael,Blah-di-blah!
Dwight,"The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever."
Andy,It doesn't matter.
Angela,Jim. Pam. And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. I wish you both a pleasant day. And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
Michael,We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
Pam,Cece's getting christened today.
Andy,"If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway."
Jim,Big day.
Michael,"Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?"
Pam,Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
Andy,Stop the bus!
Jim,Nope.
Michael and Andy,Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
Michael,Top of the Sunday morning to you.
Guy,"Okay, stop the dang bus."
Andy,"And a top of the day to you too, sir."
Michael,"Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you."
Ryan,Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Another guy,Wait for me! Don't say anything to my parents.
Michael,"Oh, yes. Doobie-doobie doo."
Erin,Get in quick.
Michael,"I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys."
Michael,Why quick?
Andy,"Ah, man."
Erin,So it's faster.
Andy,"Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids."
Erin,Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
Dwight,For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
Michael,Is anyone still at the church?
Toby,"Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do."
Erin,"No, actually most of them went to go see a movie."
Michael,Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
Michael,What? Shut up.
Pam,"Oh, Michael, this is just for family."
Erin,"Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan."
Michael,But I'm the Godfather.
Michael,It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
Jim,"It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather."
Erin,I bet. You guys.
Michael,Are you talking to me?
Guy,Can I come?
Jim,"Ok, your turn."
Erin,"Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?"
Michael,Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Radio,"""... banana bread, but Fred Nordquist had no appetite. He was thinking about his pair of new boots. It'd been ten years after all. As he told Mrs. Nordquist, it would take two years to get comfortable with the new boots."""
Pam,"Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather."
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,"I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry."
Michael,I'm not the godfather.
Pam,"Okay, thank you."
Michael,So who is the godfather?
Pam,"Our friend, Seth, and his wife there."
Michael,"Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?"
Pam,"No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later."
Michael,"No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show."
Pam,"Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael."
Michael,"I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out."
Church congregation,"We ask you, Lord, come to our aid."
Pastor,Good morning.
All,Good morning.
Michael,Good morning.
Pastor,"What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing."
Pastor,"You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico."
Ryan,"I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes."
Toby,"Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope..."
Female church member,And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.
Pastor,Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance?
Dwight,"Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price."
Pastor,"Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies."
Pam,Somebody needs a change.
Jim,Right now?
Pam,"Well, she can't bring this up with her."
Jim,"Okay. All right, come on. Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip."
Jim,"Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!"
Pam,What?
Jim,What?
Pam,"Honey, no."
Jim,Yes.
Pam,"No, no."
Jim,This is happening.
Pam,We have an extra outfit in the bag.
Jim,No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
Pam,You said you checked it.
Jim,I did... say that.
Pastor,"At this time, will the families please come join me?"
Michael,"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever."
Pastor,"Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the ""Halberts"" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service."
Jim,Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
Jim,"Okay, ""A,"" Halbert. And, ""B,"" I think a more appropriate statement would be, ""The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."""
Ryan,"For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?"
Kelly,"Try ""Jesus."""
Dwight,Opus dei.
Male church member,Hi. Good morning.
Michael,Good morning.
Female church member [to Michael],Good morning.
Michael,Good morning.
Ryan,Hello.
Dwight,"Shh, shh, shh."
Michael,How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
Lady,Good morning.
Michael,I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
Jim,Hey.
Doug [church member],"I'm Doug Mcpherson, Davey's uncle."
Jim,"Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby."
Doug,Davey.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,Wow.
Angela,"Well, this is intimate."
Pam,We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
Angela,You don't know them all?
Pam,"Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all."
Angela,Jesus is not your caterer. But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? They don't think.
Pam,Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
Jim,"Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?"
Pam,I don't know. I'm just hungry.
Jim,"Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. Sorry. I think I'm just hungry."
Michael,"Oh, after you."
Male church member,"Oh, no, after you."
Michael,"No, I insist. After me."
Male church member,I'm gonna use that one. Have a good lunch.
Michael,Thank you. You too.
Stanley,This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
Kevin,"I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?"
Michael,"You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch."
Kevin,"With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes."
Girl,"Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry that's leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there."
Ryan,"Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts."
Girl,This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old when my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip.
Phyllis,Who takes a kid to Mexico?
Stanley,I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
Michael,Shh.
Girl,"Right now, Jessica's children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors."
Michael,No.
Girl,"It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos."
Dwight,"Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold."
Michael,"Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey."
Dwight,I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Michael,Are you kidding me? Stop it.
Dwight,I'll call you back.
Girl,"My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?"
Andy,What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
Michael,Shh.
Girl,Thank you. Or should I say gracias?
Pam,Cece went down.
Woman,What was this? You're out of it.
Jim,Scones.
Woman,I didn't get one.
Pam,"Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either."
Woman,Is it just the one jug of apple cider?
Pam,Who the heck was that?
Jim,"I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic."
Pam,We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
Jim,All right. And cider.
Michael,Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
Stanley,You could feed the hungry. Us.
Oscar,Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
Michael,"Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together."
Darryl,We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
Michael,Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Phyllis,"Church isn't a party, Michael."
Michael,"Well, it's, it's-"
Ryan,Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
Michael,"No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month."
Jim,"Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs."
Mee-Maw,"Fine, fine. I guess I'll watch Suzanne's purse and your baby."
Michael,Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. Bye. Okay.
Michael,Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Students,Yeah!
Michael,I'll take a shirt.
Guy,Are you coming?
Michael,"If you'll have me, yes."
Guy,"Heck, yes."
Michael,Really? Thank you. All right.
Oscar,Michael. Get off the bus.
Michael,"No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going."
Gabe,"Michael, this is irresponsible."
Michael,It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
Darryl,I agree. I think it's superb.
Gabe,"Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales."
Michael,"You know what, my job will be here when I get back."
Andy,"Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport."
Guy,"You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico."
Michael,"Hey, right?"
Phyllis,"Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?"
Michael,"Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them."
Phyllis,"Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?"
Michael,Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
Dwight,"Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?"
Michael,"No, you may not."
Dwight,Gah!
Erin,"I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave."
Michael,Thank you.
Andy,"Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!"
Andy,I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Guy,We're actually building them a school.
Andy,Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
Michael,See you in a few months.
Girl,"If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldn't have so many problems."
Michael,Mm. That's not gonna happen.
Andy,We're one in a million.
Girl,I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.
Michael,"Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So..."
Andy,"Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals..."
Toby,Why you always got to be so mean to me?
Jim,"Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?"
MeeMaw,I don't know. I lost the purse too.
Jim,Okay.
Andy,"Good-bye, Lackawana County."
Michael,How long till we get to Mexico?
Andy,"Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more."
Michael,"Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?"
Andy,"I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or..."
Michael,Why aren't they building it themselves?
Andy,They don't know how.
Michael,Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
Andy,"Well, Carla knows."
Michael,"Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?"
Carla,"Oh, trying to sleep."
Michael,"What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?"
Andy,"Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?"
Michael,"Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday."
Andy,And the Christmas party.
Michael,And Cinco de Mayo.
Andy,"Nah, no. We'll be back before that."
Michael,"No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus."
Jim,"Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?"
Phyllis,"Here's her carrier, but no Cece."
Jim's Dad,"Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where's the little girl of honor?"
Jim,"I don't know, dad. I don't know."
Doug,"I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there."
Jim,"I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?"
Doug,I think maybe some blonde lady had her.
Jim,A small blonde woman?
Doug,Smaller than me.
Jim,"Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!"
Angela,What are you doing?
Kevin,Give me the baby!
Angela,What? Kevin!
Helene,"Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby."
Jim,Hi.
Pam,Honey.
Jim,"Hi. All right. Travel safe, Angela."
Angela,Did you think I stole your baby?
Jim,"What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you."
Kevin,"Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?"
Angela,Someone put them in my bag.
Doug,"So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, let's haul out. Rendezvous at Friendly's."
Erin,"They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house."
Pam,Yes! I have been so authorized.
Reporter,Police have now surrounded the apartment complex.
Angela,"Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead."
Michael,They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Pam,Okay.
Reporter,It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
Angela,"Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?"
Kevin,They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Pam,"You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-"
Dwight,"They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats."
Angela,You know what Pam just save it.
Angela,"Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this."
Erin,You did this?
Gabe,"Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco."
Michael,"No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah."
Erin,It's pronounced wacko.
Erin,Why don't you like him?
Jim,"Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all."
Michael,"What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?"
Kelly,Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out?
Erin,I care if you like him.
Andy,"I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city."
Michael,Why? I'm not your father. All right.
Kevin,No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Erin,Okay...
Michael,"Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! Come on everybody!"
Michael,Go to your room.
Michael,There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!
Erin,What?
Michael,"Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship."
Michael,Go to your room young lady!
Erin,Michael!
Erin,"Uhm, I'm not going to my room."
Michael,Walk with me.
Michael,"You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore."
Erin,"Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee."
Erin,You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do.
Michael,"Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!"
Michael,As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
Jim,Okay?
Erin,I hate your roof!
Erin,Yeah it's a TV show...
Michael,Oh do not raise your voice to me!
Michael,Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Erin,I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Stanley,I...
Michael,"Gahh, I will pull this car over!"
Michael,Cancel it! Are you still here?
Erin,I hate it! I hate your car!
Erin,Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Gabe,See ya Oscar!
Michael,MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
Michael,"If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family."
Erin,"Okay, sorry."
Michael,"Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray."
Michael,I'm joking.
Gabe,What happened?
Erin,Wait which one?
Andy,I accidentally ate some seahorses.
Michael,"I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek."
Gabe,How much?
Erin,Good me too!
Andy,"I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know."
Michael,You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. I am coming to your party.
Gabe,"I've got just the thing! This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon."
Erin,"I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends."
Andy,That's so beautiful.
Kelly,"No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!"
Kelly,"And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible."
Angela,Are you going?
Dwight,Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Angela,I would watch that.
Dwight,Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
Andy,You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Erin,Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Andy,You would?
Erin,You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Andy,Try and keep me from coming!
Erin,Why would I keep you from coming?
Andy,"Try and hide it, I will track this party down!"
Erin,Why would I hide it!
Michael,Kevin!
Kevin,"Hey, you going tonight?"
Michael,"Yes, I am. Are you?"
Kevin,Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Michael,What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
Kevin,No he's not the boss.
Michael,Why did you just say he was the boss?
Kevin,"'Cause, you're the boss!"
Michael,Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
Erin,It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Michael,Uh huh...
Erin,Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Michael,Big...
Erin,Those posters used to be real French ads.
Michael,All right!
Gabe,"So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and..."
Michael,Okay okay okay.
Michael,"Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!"
Michael,
Gabe,You don't really toss the dough.
Michael,"Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you."
Gabe,Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Jim,You play?
Gabe,"Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe."
Jim,You can't even do that.
Cece,
Pam,She's up! Great!
Pam,"Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night."
Erin,The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting!
Phyllis,Who's that?
Kelly,Finn.
Phyllis,Who's that?
Kelly,Rachel.
Phyllis,Which one's Glee?
Kelly,You have to stop.
Michael,"Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!"
Gabe,It's a little loud...
Michael,Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Gabe,Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Michael,Well some of us are trying to have a...
Gabe,I'll just turn the captions on.
Michael,Well I will turn up the volume.
Gabe,That's for the other box.
Michael,"Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!"
Oscar,That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Kelly,"You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from..."
Oscar,"You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book."
Pam,Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
Michael,"Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?"
Pam,You have a gun in your desk?
Ryan,Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
Andy,No what?
Ryan,"What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic."
Andy,Yeah.
Michael,"Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated."
Dwight,"Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first."
Pam,Maybe I should go.
Dwight,"Kelly. Kev- Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby."
Daryl,Take a shot.
Andy,Oh thanks.
Daryl,"Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff."
Andy,Why does Erin like Gabe?
Daryl,"Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you."
Andy,"That's really nice, thank you."
Daryl,And I'd blow your mind.
Andy,
Jim,
Oscar,Jim what are you doing?
Jim,"Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores."
Oscar,Flip it back please.
Jim,Okay...
Kelly,"The show's back on, what happened?"
Ryan,We're behind.
Oscar,Go to the recorded version.
Kelly,Oh my God what song was that?
Erin,I wasn't recording it.
Oscar,What?!
Kelly,What song was it?
Erin,"Wait, why do you have to record it?"
Oscar,This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Erin,Jim.
Kelly,"Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? 'Cause we missed it!"
Pam,If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Dwight,That would be nice wouldn't it?
Pam,I can't even talk about it.
Dwight,"You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours."
Pam,I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
Dwight,Really? Oh... Then here we are.
Erin,"Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some help so, he was wondering if you could help him."
Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?"
Phyllis,You know your perfumes!
Andy,My nanny used to wear that.
Andy,"I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! I feel exactly like a seahorse! Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub."
Erin,Look who I found!
Michael,"Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find."
Gabe,Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
Michael,Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
Gabe,Yep! Waste not right?
Michael,"So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se."
Erin,"Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,"
Michael,Well...
Erin,Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Michael,He's the longest baby in this room.
Erin,What's the longest thing you've ever seen? For me it was the tale from Jets.
Gabe,Erin you don't have to...
Michael,You know what Erin you do have to.
Gabe,Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
Michael,That's what she said.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,It's a miracle. She loves him.
Jim,"I don't know about, love..."
Dwight,She loves me.
Angela,Outside my car in two minutes.
Dwight,"Well something's come up, I have to go."
Pam,No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Dwight,I have something to do.
Pam,"Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?"
Dwight,I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Jim,Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
Dwight,Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Pam,Absolutely!
Dwight,From Jim.
Jim,I don't think that's gonna...
Pam,Do it!
Jim,What kind of pizza would you like?
Dwight,Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
Michael,Okay... Alright.
TV,"And the winner is, by two votes-"
Kelly,Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
Andy,"Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?"
Creed,Beleniege!
Andy,What does this say?
Creed,HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
Andy,Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Erin,Are you having a good time?
Andy,Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Erin,Andy you look awful!
Andy,You're four seasons in a day. You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- Put if you put on a blue... It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Erin,Are you alright?
Andy,No!
Dwight,Insert it in my mouth.
Jim,That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Dwight,"No, try me."
Pam,"Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it."
Dwight,I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Jim,Okay...
Dwight,"No. Crust first. Okay, now the beer. Beer me Jim. Ssss. Gentle. Now I've gotta go meet Angela."
Pam,"What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!"
Dwight,"I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced."
Jim,You need to stop talking.
Dwight,"Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. s*x contracts exist!"
Pam,Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
Dwight,"Yeah sure, Jim could go see her."
Jim,Okay...
Dwight,You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Jim,"I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me."
Pam,"No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela."
Dwight,She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Pam,The reverse cycling ends tonight!
Dwight,A single piece of pepperoni please.
Jim,I'm not gonna-
Dwight,What are you doing?
Kevin,"I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!"
Andy,Puts pillow in front of the puke.
Phyllis,Are you alright?
Andy,Erin likes Gabe.
Phyllis,I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Andy,Do you think that they've ever...
Phyllis,Made love? I don't know.
Andy,Well girls tell each other things right?
Phyllis,I'll see what I can find out.
Daryl,Where you been?
Michael,I just went out for a walk.
Daryl,Cable's out.
Michael,What? Really? That stinks!
Gabe,It's still on upstairs.
Michael,What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
Creed,"Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet."
Michael,Are you kidding me?
Creed,No.
Michael,Now that's going on?
Kevin,I can't believe we're missing that!
Michael,"Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot."
Kevin,"Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!"
Kelly,Good luck Michael!
Phyllis,"Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?"
Erin,"Oh, uhm, like three months."
Phyllis,And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Erin,I don't know.
Phyllis,"Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical."
Erin,I have to go Phyllis.
Phyllis,Magical...
Pam,Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Angela,What are you doing here?
Pam,"I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone."
Angela,Are you authorized to do this?
Dwight,"Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation."
Creed,We're working.
Michael,"My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet."
Gabe,Can you at least try to look busy?
Jim,"Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work."
Jim,
Michael,"Uh... try ""password""."
Jo,"""The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, ""You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat."" The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. ""I love you, you Gay b*st*rd,"" I said. ""You Gay b*st*rd,"" I s--. ""Gay Ba--"" ""Gay B--"""""
Jim,Nope.
Ryan,"Michael, how's it going, bro?"
Dwight,"Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero."
Michael,"Good, good, bro."
Jim,No.
Ryan,"Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there."
Dwight,"Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one."
Michael,"Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?"
Jim,"Okay, I'm not doing every number."
Ryan,"I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money."
Pam,"Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?"
Michael,"Nine days, though. That's, like..."
Michael,Uh... it was like eight years ago?
Ryan,"Look, I know I've tapped you so hard."
Pam,"Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time."
Michael,"Yes, you have tapped this. Hard."
Erin,"Um, everyone was getting their driver's license."
Ryan,"Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit."
Jim,"Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?"
Michael,Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
Michael,"Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it."
Ryan,"Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower."
Andy,"I got it, try, um--"
Michael,So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
Michael,"You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended."
Ryan,Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Kevin,Big Boobs.
Michael,Mm-Hmm.
Meridith,Drama Queen?
Ryan,Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
Angela,Nosy?
Michael,"Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so..."
Pam,"You're typing ""Big Boobs""?"
Ryan,We totally should.
Jim,I'm trying everything.
Michael,Tonight?
Dwight,"Try ""Big Boobs"" with a ""Z""."
Ryan,I gotta work on this.
Jim,That's-- the password. We're in.
Michael,Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
Dwight,All Right
Ryan,Yeah.
Kevin,Wow.
Dwight,"And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. And let's hear it for... Purebred. Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!"
Dwight,Yes.
Dwight,Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Michael,The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
Man,"So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?"
Michael,Morning.
Angela,"You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?"
Ryan,How's It Going?
Man,My wife passed away a few years ago.
Ryan,"Hey, I'm WUPHF."
Angela,How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
Michael,I'm Facebook.
Man,Thank You.
Ryan,What's up Facebook?
Kevin,Help! Hello?! Oh! Help!
Michael,"I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back."
Daryl,Consider it a WUPHF in person.
Ryan,You should've sent me a WUPHF.
Andy,Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
Michael,A what?
Daryl,You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
Ryan,"When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time."
Andy,"If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell."
Robotic Voice,WUPHF.
Ryan,I'm betting on myself.
Ryan and Michael,WUPHF!
Stanley,It's a bad bet.
Michael,Dot com!
Michael,Hello.
Ryan,Thanks Erin.
Ryan,Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Erin,Sure.
Daryl,"It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you."
Erin,Pam.
Andy,"All those in favor of selling, say aye."
Pam,Mm-Hmm?
Michael,"I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay."
Erin,I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
Daryl,What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
Pam,Okay.
Stanley,"Michael, are you that blind?"
Erin,"Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--"
Michael,"I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground."
Pam,"Oh, it's okay."
Andy,You're gonna lose all of our money.
Erin,But it's not for--
Michael,"Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money."
Pam,Let it go.
Ryan,"Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time."
Pam,"Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set."
Michael,You can't have it.
Michael,I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
Ryan,Okay. I won't let you down.
Ryan,I love it.
Dwight,Angela? Angela!
Michael,"I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop."
Michael,"The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... That's Uh..."
Ryan,"Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company."
Robotic Voice,"WUPHF, from Ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride."
Michael,Your kidding?!
Michael,Thank God.
Ryan,"We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way."
Jim,
Michael,You and me.
Gabe,Gabe Lewis.
Ryan,"New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today."
Jo,
Michael,Don't you work here full-time?
Gabe,"Well, Jo--"
Ryan,"Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet."
Jo,"Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay b*st*rd. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my--"
Michael,Mm-Hmm.
Jim,"All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry."
Ryan,"Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you."
Jo,"I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--"
Michael,That does sound fun to me.
Ryan,Awesome.
Dwight,"Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality."
Dwight,"Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it ""Hay Place"". Eldred Called it ""Hay World"". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! Watch it, watch it."
Dwight,Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Guy,Don't forget to make a broom.
Dwight,"Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2"
Angela,"Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay."
Dwight,"Roll in the hay, five dollars."
Angela,"No, I meant..."
Dwight,"Oh, our contract."
Angela,Mm-Hmm.
Dwight,"Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil."
Angela,Perfect!
Dwight,"So, uh... Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales."
Jim,"All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. Whoo!"
Jim,"I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything."
Kevin,Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
Jim,"Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev."
Kevin,"I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, ""dunh-duh-na-dah!"" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right."
Angela,"You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero."
Jim,What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
Angela,It's a new corporate policy.
Kevin,Dunh-duh-na-dah!
Gabe,"Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?"
Jim,"A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?"
Gabe,"When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?"
Jim,Nope.
Gabe,Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
Jim,Okay.
Gabe,"My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just-- keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room."
Michael,"Excuse me, everyone... s*x! Now that I have your attention..."
Stanley,You don't have our attention.
Michael,MONEY!
Stanley,I'm listening.
Kevin,"You had me at ""s*x."""
Michael,Pervert.
Phyllis,You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
Michael,That's good to know.
Pam,"What do you want to say, Michael?"
Michael,"Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan."
Ryan,How's everybody doing?!
Michael,Whoo!
Ryan,"Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you."
Stanley,"Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space."
Ryan,"For my current investors, things are going great."
Michael,We already have a buyer.
Pam,Really?! Who?!
Ryan,Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
Michael,At least.
Ryan,So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
Phyliss,"Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies."
Oscar,"Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?"
Ryan,"No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun."
Michael,That's right!
Ryan,"Fun, communication, connection."
Oscar,What's your money situation?
Ryan,"Well, it's tight, as with any start-up."
Oscar,"Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?"
Ryan,We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
Andy,"I'm sorry, nine days until what?"
Oscar,Bankruptcy?
Michael,"Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?"
Oscar,How long do you think a week is?
Michael,"No, not this weekend"
Jim,"Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?"
Jim,"Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything."
Pam,Did you prank Dwight?
Jim,No.
Pam,"Well, you like that."
Jim,"Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work."
Pam,"I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own."
Jim,
Pam,Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Ryan,Check this out.
Erin,All that color.
Michael,Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
Andy,Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
Ryan,"Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend."
Michael,There you go.
Andy,You have his email?
Ryan,"A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over."
Stanley,I want my money back.
Michael,"Do not talk like that, Stanley."
Pam,"Ryan, just tell us your plan."
Ryan,"Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back."
Dwight,"Hey kids, was that fun?"
Kids,Yeah!
Dwight,All Right!
Kid,I wanna go on it again.
Dwight,"Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks."
Dwight,"Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose."
Angela,
Angela,Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
Dwight,"Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?"
Angela,"No, I--I think you should make time for it."
Little Girl,I found the needle in the haystack!
Dwight,"Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?"
Little Girl,I don't know!
Dwight,Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
Angela,Dwight?
Ryan,"WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach."
Michael,Here we go.
Ryan,"Everyone's like, ""Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?"" Or, Uh, ""Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!"""
Michael,"""It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"""
Ryan,"""Yo, Ry from WUPHF!"""
Michael,"""He's up there."""
Ryan,"""What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!"" WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!"
Michael,Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
Daryl,"Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?"
Ryan,"The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever."
Andy,That sounds weird.
Michael,"No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that."
Kelly,"Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?"
Kelly,"I said to Ryan, ""I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'"""
Ryan,"Baby, Baby, Baby--"
Kelly,I think I'm gonna stay here.
Ryan,"No, no, no, no, no."
Kelly,"I do, I do. This isn't right."
Ryan,I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
Kelly,But I--it's not right.
Ryan,"I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this."
Daryl,Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
Ryan,The Washington University Public Health Fund.
Daryl,W.U.P.H.F.
Pam,"Oh, God!"
Daryl,They only want it for the initials.
Ryan,"The domain name. Yeah, they do."
Pam,I move we sell!
Micheal,What?
Daryl,"Yeah, sell!"
Andy,"Yeah, sell."
Pam,Sell.
Stanley,Get us out of this!
Ryan,Have some faith in this idea!
Daryl,"If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?"
Michael,I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
Ryan,"Yes. You alone do, actually."
Michael,I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
Kevin,Awesome!
Man,Do you mind if we share this bale?
Angela,Sure.
Man,"There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?"
Angela,Probably.
Man,"I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?"
Angela,Mm-Hmm.
Man,"I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday."
Angela,"Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. Don't laugh at me."
Man,"No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke."
Angela,Oh.
Man,Pay Place.
Angela,"Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day."
Man,That's humorous.
Angela,Thank You.
Kevin,You guys know how to get out?
Pam,"Hi, Michael."
Michael,"Can't talk, saving the planet."
Pam,"Oh, we don't recycle."
Michael,"We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?"
Pam,I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
Michael,Eight Years.
Pam,"Listen, I know you really like Ryan--"
Michael,"No, I won't even consider it."
Pam,"Michael, I... I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?"
Michael,"Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor."
Pam,"Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you."
Michael,I think you are wrong.
Pam,And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
Michael,You may be right. I may be crazy.
Pam,Don't.
Michael,I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
Pam,"Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing."
Michael,I thought it might make me feel better.
Pam,Okay. Go Ahead.
Michael,But it just may be a lunatic... No.
Jim,"Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go."
Meridith,"Hey, back off. It's Solitare."
Creed,"Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work."
Jim,Talk to me.
Creed,"How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? Good."
Gabe,"Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?"
Dwight,
Dwight,Hey Pam.
Jim,Why?
Pam ,Yeah?
Dwight,"Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes."
Dwight,"Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office."
Pam,Do you mind?
Pam,"I know, because you're the reason we're moving."
Dwight,"I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter."
Dwight,"Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?"
Pam,You don't have to do that.
Pam,"Uhh, I think it's something like umm..."
Dwight,"D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear."
Dwight,What's the exact square footage.
Jim,"Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do."
Pam,"Umm, let me see."
Dwight,
Dwight,How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
Jim,"Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong."
Pam,"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet."
Dwight,"Uhh, aah!"
Dwight,"You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say ""Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is."" I can't wait."
Jim,"Well, A for effort right?"
Pam,Mmhmm.
Dwight,
Pam,I lied about some aspects of the building.
Hank,"Welcome, start your morning right with a burst of blueberry. Or try plain."
Jim,It's still on a bike path though right?
Andy,What's the occasion?
Pam,There's no building... it doesn't exist.
Hank,Dwight said this entry was a waste of space.
Jim,What does that mean?
Andy,I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
Pam,"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna..."
Hank,Eight dollars.
Jim,What?
Andy,Eight dollars?
Pam,Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
Dwight,"Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money."
Jim,But you didn't fail.
Michael,"Mmhmm, China. China."
Pam,"And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales."
Erin,How was the dentist?
Jim,And you didn't fail those things either.
Michael,It was great. China.
Pam,"Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?"
Pam,"Are you okay, what's wrong?"
Jim,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Michael,"Everything here was made in China, Pam."
Oscar,"Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated."
Andy,"Yeah, its where they make stuff."
Michael,"Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?"
Michael,"They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir."
Oscar,We have missiles too.
Erin,"Oh, no."
Michael,"Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon."
Michael,"Yeah, right here. It is right there. Anybody read the news any more?"
Nate,I wasn't here.
Dwight,China is on the move?
Pam,What?
Michael,"I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again."
Nate,I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
Michael,"My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight."
Pam,Well thanks.
Darryl,Hey Andy.
Nate,Yeah.
Andy,Hey Darryl.
Michael,China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
Darryl,You gotta stop texting me so much.
Oscar,"Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan."
Andy,But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
Michael,How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
Darryl,You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
Oscar,Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Andy,Got it. Then I will call you.
Michael,Don't... I...
Darryl,No.
Pam,"Hello, hello. You're breaking the law."
Darryl,"There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. ""I'm coming over baby."" And I would text back ""BTB"", bring that booty."
Dwight,"Impossible, I love the law."
Stanley,"Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?"
Pam,"Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper."
Dwight,"I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is."
Dwight,"I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper."
Pam,"Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to..."
Nate,I don't think it goes that way.
Stanley,Don't tell me how to do my business.
Dwight,Reply it!
Dwight,"Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner."
Oscar,"Don't worry about the coffee, its on me."
Jim,Which is you.
Michael,"Yeah, I figured that."
Dwight,"""Which is you"" is not a sentence."
Oscar,"Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat."
Jim,I disagree with.
Michael,Wait. You forgetting something?
Stanley,"Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?"
Oscar,What?
Pam,"Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks."
Michael,"This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you."
Dwight,"Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment."
Erin,"Fire him. No, show mercy."
Pam,I'm not going to do that.
Michael,Here we are.
Dwight,"Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy."
Oscar,What's your point.
Nate,Y'ello.
Michael,"My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA."
Pam,"Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert."
Andy,Yeah.
Nate,"Oh, hey Pam."
Erin,"Right, yes."
Pam,"Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight."
Michael,"I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation."
Nate,Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
Oscar,That's not.
Pam,Sure.
Michael,Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up."
Oscar,That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
Nate,"Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha..."
Dwight,"They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion."
Pam,"Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends."
Darryl,Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
Dwight,"You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity."
Andy,Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away.
Erin,Oh my God.
Darryl,That's a text.
Michael,What?
Andy,Yeah. Right.
Erin,"According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese."
Darryl,That's your new standard.
Michael,So much for keeping our secrets up high.
Erin,What's America gonna do?
Michael,I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
Michael,"Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes."
Angela,You never told us to close them.
Michael,Welcome to your future.
Phyllis,What do we do? How do we stop this?
Michael,"How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?"
Pam,An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
Michael,"Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin."
Kevin,An antacid that you only take once a week.
Michael,Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
Kevin,Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Stanley,Why not just go one for the year?
Michael,I don't know.
Kevin,It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Michael,Alright.
Erin,"What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?"
Erin,"I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing."
Michael,I don't know what the that was.
Dwight,"I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve."
Phyllis,"Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb."
Michael,"No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine."
Erin,
Oscar,"Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now."
Kevin,Thank God.
Michael,"No, no. That is right now."
Oscar,"Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian."
Michael,"In terms of land, not population."
Oscar,Come on Michael. You can...
Michael,"No, no you're wrong about this."
Oscar,Where are you getting this information?
Michael,I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
Kevin,"Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?"
Jim,"Okay, someone look it up."
Ryan,I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
Oscar,Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Darryl,"""Are you watching this?"" Seriously?"
Andy,Well are you?
Darryl,I'm sitting right here.
Ryan,Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Meredith,Suck it Oscar.
Jim,"Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael."
Oscar,Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
Michael,So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? I don't care.
Michael,"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?"
Meredith,"Wow, so this building can get uglier."
Stanley,I will not work in a roach billboard.
Gabe,"Oh my God, I can't look at roaches."
Angela,Michael do something about this.
Michael,"Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business."
Pam,Dwight take it down.
Dwight,
Pam,"I'm serious, take it down or else."
Dwight,Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Pam,We can move out.
Angela,Really?
Pam,"So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?"
Jim,"Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?"
Pam,I went out to look for a better office space.
Dwight,Waste of time.
Pam,"Not really, because I found one."
Jim,"Oh wow, these are nice."
Pam,Yup.
Dwight,Let me see.
Pam,"Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room."
Jim,"Yeah, yeah. Totally."
Dwight,You can't just move out.
Pam,"Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures."
Andy,Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
Pam,They're not of Cece.
Andy,"Oh, cool."
Pam,This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Phyllis,Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Pam,"Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak."
Stanley,Are you trying to kill me?
Kelly,Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
Pam,Koreans.
Kelly,Good. And the dry cleaners?
Pam,White.
Kelly,Good.
Jim,"Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order."
Oscar,Funny Jim. That is funny.
Michael,Very comedically humorous Jim.
Kelly,I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
Oscar,What is it?
Kelly,Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
Oscar,Alright. Alright I get it.
Kelly,"Michael, how do I create a new tab?"
Michael,Try 'Control P'.
Oscar,That's print.
Michael,Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
Kelly,Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
Oscar,"He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing."
Kelly,"Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually."
Ryan,"Actually, it was."
Jim,"Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican."
Darryl,Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
Andy,Megan Fox! Come on!
Darryl,"You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked."
Andy,"Yes, but one good text away from a high five."
Darryl,You accept these terms?
Andy,"Oh, its on."
Dwight,"In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list."
Kevin,"Well, I wish for a million wishes."
Dwight,"Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a..."
Kevin,Then see you later building.
Dwight,You can't possibly be serious.
Kevin,I said see you later building.
Oscar,Hey Michael.
Michael,Hey.
Oscar,I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Michael,Mmm.
Oscar,I'd love to talk more about it.
Michael,Yeah.
Oscar,Maybe over some coffee later?
Michael,Sure.
Jim,"Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?"
Michael,Coffee Jim.
Jim,No.
Andy,It is not just coffee.
Jim,"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?"
Michael,Yes.
Andy,And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
Michael,"Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary."
Jim,No politics?
Michael,"I'm pretty good on politics. ""California is bankrupt, and California, California."" What?"
Dwight,"Parley, my office, five minutes."
Pam,Parley?
Creed,"Pirate code, he wants to meet."
Pam,So everyone here knows pirate code?
Creed,"I understand it, I can't speak it."
Dwight,"Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap."
Pam,You've been watering down the soap?
Dwight,Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
Pam,We need everything back the way it was.
Dwight,"You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping."
Pam,"That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed."
Ryan,Where is Tibet?
Michael,Pass.
Ryan,When was China founded?
Michael,Pass.
Jim,"Two for two, keep it up."
Ryan,Who is Mao?
Michael,Lifeline.
Andy,"Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know."
Michael,I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
Jim,What do you know about boobs?
Andy,"Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II."
Jim,Thank you.
Andy,"This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!"
Michael,"Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?"
Andy,I'm like a quarter of the way through.
Michael,Is it going to be worth it?
Andy,No.
Ryan,"Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet."
Michael,I don't need to cheat.
Jim,Show him how to use it.
Nate,Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
Dwight,"Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that."
Nate,Yeah.
Dwight,There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
Nate,The building's underground?
Dwight,"She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam..."
Dwight & Nate,"Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam."
Passer-by,Yeah?
Nate,Pam. Pam?
Dwight,What?
Passer-by,I'm Pam.
Dwight,Oh.
Nate,No you're not.
Dwight,I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
Passer-by,"Oh, that's fine."
Dwight,"So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?"
Passer-by,I've been known to bend the truth.
Dwight,"Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go."
Passer-by,Okay.
Dwight,"I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam."
Nate,Got it.
Jim,Okay... Holly's back.
Kevin,For your feet!
Pam,Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
Michael,Hi. Hi. Oh...
Ryan,It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
Michael,"People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one."
Holly,"Oh, huggy monster!"
Creed,For me?
Jim,One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
Michael,"Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly."
Angela,Yes.
Pam,"Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge."
Holly,Hi.
Creed,Thank you very much.
Kevin,"Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'."
Kevin,Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Angela,Mmhmm.
Andy,Let's just jump in the air!
Holly,"Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them."
Angela,"I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation."
Michael,That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
Michael,That's adorable.
Kevin,"Wow, that's awesome!"
Pam,Okay.
Holly,Would you put those out?
Oscar,A real David and Goliath story.
Nate,"One, two, three. Not everyone jumped."
Erin,"To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?"
Robert,I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.
Michael,"Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go."
Holly,"Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers."
Angela,I am.
Nate,"One, two, three. Still some people not jumping."
Michael,"Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party."
Meredith,The real problem is the teachers' union.
Jim,You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
Holly,"Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did."
Angela,"Zip it, Meredith."
Dwight,"I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar."
Michael,"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your desk."
Meredith,No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Phyllis,I am jumping.
Holly,Watch out for my guns they're both loaded.
Ryan,"Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?"
Dwight,You are?
Michael,What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
Angela,You are. You make your own drink.
Phyllis,"Yes, I'm jumping."
Jim,Aww...
Oscar,I'll make it. What are you drinking.
Dwight,"Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that."
Holly,It's a pea shoot...
Ryan,An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
Pam,I'm freezing.
Michael,This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
Oscar,I don't know how to make that.
Nate,"Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'."
Holly,"Yeah, kind of."
Ryan,"Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito."
Erin,I didn't want to miss it.
Michael,Oh...
Angela,"And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest."
Andy,"Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that."
Holly,Oh...
Meredith,Annoying.
Oscar,Here's a question nobody's asking
Michael,"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! Oh, I love toy..."
Angela,Yes.
Michael,"Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?"
Holly,AJ gave me that.
Pam,"I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe."
Oscar,Why?
Michael,"Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?"
Jim,"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright."
Michael,I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Holly,Mmhmm.
Pam,Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?
Nate,"Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero."
Michael,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
Jim,"Ooh, go easy with the shaking."
Michael,We didn't get it.
Holly,Why?
Pam,"Oh, my God."
Pam,"I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties."
Michael,"Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie."
Jim,You like it?
Pam,It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
Holly,That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
Pam,I love it.
Jim,Why's it smell real? Ah... good one.
Michael,You're kidding me. Ahh!
Jim,"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that."
Michael,"Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children!"
Holly,"No. I know. I was like, ""What? Are you serious?"""
Jim,"Alright, my turn."
All,Merry Christmas.
Michael,What a douche bag!
Pam,"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder."
Michael,How's everybody doing today?
Holly,Get a life!
Jim,"Right. Of course. ""The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert."" Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter."
Erin,Good.
Michael,Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
Jim,I mean...
Michael,How's the party coming along?
Holly,We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
Pam,"Michael, wait!"
Pam,Great.
Michael,Mmhmm.
Michael,"Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip."
Michael,Are we over budget?
Holly,Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
Pam,That's good advice.
Pam,Nope.
Michael,Good for him.
Michael,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died."
Michael,No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Holly,Next day I found him in my bed.
Pam,That's a sad story.
Meredith,Not yet!
Michael,Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
Michael,"Yeah, well, at least he was married."
Michael,"Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?"
Holly,We live together.
Pam,"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay."
Angela,Nothing. Should be fun.
Michael,"Oh, you do?"
Michael,"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay."
Michael,"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?"
Holly,"He had a little note pinned to him that said, ""You've got a friend in me."""
Pam,"I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over."
Stanley,Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
Michael,"Yeah, Randy Newman's the best."
Michael,Really?
Michael,"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?"
Holly,Yeah. I love him.
Pam,"Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?"
Andy,Yea?
Michael,Me too.
Michael,No.
Michael,Whatcha got?
Pam,So just be patient.
Andy,"All good, Santa."
Michael,"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall."
Michael,"Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!"
Jim,I surrender.
Michael,"My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama."
Andy,"Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree."
Dwight,I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
Kelly,"It's present time, you guys. Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre."
Pam,"Hey, how about this one?"
Jim,Anything. You got it.
Gabe,We just want to say how grateful we are.
Andy,"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?"
Dwight,You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
Kelly,"Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, ""Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do."""
Pam,Maybe. I mean...
Jim,You're a psychopath.
Kelly,It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
Darryl,"I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, oh... pick a damn tree already."
Dwight,I'll take that as a no.
Andy,Hello Kitty's for girls.
Pam,"Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too."
Michael,"I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it."
Pam,Nashua got mp3 players.
Andy,"I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself."
Kelly,"Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me."
Phyllis,"Yeah, I don't even have a laptop."
Darryl,"Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents."
Michael,"No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you."
Kelly,I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
Pam,"Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents."
Kelly,"Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt."
Meredith,Wow.
Darryl,Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
Michael,From the mall. That...
Phyllis,Oh God.
Pam,"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas."
Kelly,This is a fast food receipt from April.
Dwight,Oh come on.
Darryl,How do I do that?
Michael,"Well, that..."
Kelly,"I said, ""I wonder."" I didn't say, ""I think."""
Pam,"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun."
Kelly,"God, how many number nines did you order?"
Gabe,"Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets."
Andy,Yes.
AJ,Is everyone here kind of mean?
Kelly,"Blankets, what am I, five?"
Pam,You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Holly,"Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial."
Gabe,Erin and I make great use of ours.
Pam,"Hey guys, the tree's here."
AJ,Oh.
Gabe,"Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?"
Michael,Hey.
Holly,"Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected."
Darryl,I'll take one of those pink pouches.
Andy,"Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so..."
AJ,"Hey, what happened to Woody?"
Darryl,"I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking."
Oscar,Why would someone hug you?
Holly,"Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him."
Jim,"Hey, it's snowing."
Michael,"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome."
AJ,He smells awful.
Dwight,"Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful."
Darryl,Are you serious?
Holly,It was blue cheese dressing.
Jim,"Hey, Dwight."
Michael,It's a sophisticated take.
AJ,Great.
Dwight,"Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!"
Jada,He doesn't look like Santa Claus.
Darryl,"Hey, Mike."
Jim,"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?"
Darryl,"No, he doesn't. I told her Santa would be here."
Michael,Hey.
Dwight,Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Michael,"Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled."
Darryl,We wanted to give you something.
Phyllis,"Oh, don't be such a baby."
Pam,Who told you that?
Michael,Oh.
Stanley,"Yeah, who's a little girl now?"
Michael,"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made."
Jada,Merry Christmas.
Dwight,You apologize to me right now.
Phyllis,So is it an open relationship?
Michael,Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
Jim,You've got something on your nose.
Holly,"Oh, God, no."
Darryl,What do you say?
Dwight,You apologize right now.
Kelly,"Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?"
Jada,You're welcome.
Jim,No.
Holly,"Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together."
Michael,"Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?"
Dwight,"Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter."
Kelly,So where's the ring?
Jada,Yeah.
Jim,You got it.
Pam,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?"
Michael,I think I know where he is.
Andy,That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
Phyllis,"Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb."
Jada,A trampoline...
Dwight,"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go."
Pam,"You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life."
Michael,Mmhmm.
Kevin,"Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party."
Erin,"Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away."
Jada,Video games.
Angela,I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
Erin,"I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!"
Michael,Video games.
Oscar,State senator.
Holly,"Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over."
Jada,A DSi.
Angela,I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
Pam,"Wow, an ultimatum."
Michael,A DSi?
Oscar,Who are you dating in the public arena?
Holly,Yeah.
Jada,A horse.
Angela,The senator.
Pam,It doesn't really seem like you.
Michael,A horse.
Kevin,"Oh, right. The state senator."
Kelly,"That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself."
Jada,A pool.
Angela,We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
Dwight,
Michael,"You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?"
Kevin,"Oh, that would be impressive... if anyone knew what a comptroller was."
Jim,"Don't. Stop, Dwight! Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!"
Jada,Yes.
Oscar,Well...
Dwight,"Oh, no. Oh, no!"
Michael,All right. You have to pick up after them.
Angela,"Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. ""Angela..."" ""over here, Angela..."" ""here. Look here!"""
Jim,Stop!
Pam,"Hey, sorry. I'm ready."
Pam,"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that..."
Dwight,"Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!"
Jim,I don't want to go.
Michael,Yeah!
Jim,Okay. Okay. Okay.
Pam,"Oh... come on, bear man. Come on."
Pam,A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Dwight,Huh? You like that?
Jim,Have you ever seen 'em do that?
Michael,Pam? Pam?
Jim,Seriously!
Pam,I'm sorry. I had no idea.
Dwight,Pam?
Dwight,Huh?
Jim,"No, it's, it's okay. Okay."
Pam,"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement."
Jim,Okay. Okay.
Pam,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no."
Toby,Hi guys.
Dwight,"Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone."
Jim,Okay. This is it.
Michael,Hi.
Jim,I just want it to stop.
Pam,What?
Toby,"Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week."
Pam,"So, cool right?"
Jim,Go! Go! Go!
Michael,"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?"
Ryan,There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
Pam,"What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! Honey? Jim? Jim!"
Toby,"Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case."
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,"In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas."
Michael,"Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!"
Ryan,"We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest."
Dwight,Death to Toby!
Pam,"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?"
Toby,"Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements."
Ryan,"Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?"
Michael,"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?"
Pam,"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or..."
Phyllis,"What's the case, Toby?"
Ryan,"Well, it sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?"
Toby,"Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case."
Pam,No.
Andy,Is it criminal?
Ryan,Okay.
Toby,Yes.
Toby,"Oh, Jim. Hey."
Andy,Have we heard of it?
Jim,"Hey, Toby."
Toby,I don't know.
Toby,"There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse..."
Dwight,Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a s*x slave?
Jim,No way.
Toby,Come on.
Toby,Who looks exactly like you.
Meredith,Was it the post office guy who rubbed his pen1s all over the mail?
Jim,That's increadible.
Toby,"Guys, it's a really big deal."
Toby,"Yeah. No, it's uncanny."
Ryan,He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
Jim,You know what's crazy?
Kelly,He's rubbing his neck.
Toby,What?
Ryan,He's rubbing his neck.
Jim,I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Excuse me.
Andy,"Oh, Scranton Strangler!"
Michael,"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that."
Toby,I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty.
Angela,It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
Michael,That was the worst joke ever.
Meredith,Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Toby,Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
Gabe,Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
Michael,"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye."
Holly,"You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt."
Toby,"Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch."
Michael,"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic."
Michael,What? What?
Dwight,I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Toby,"Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know."
Jim,What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
Michael,"Hold on, Holly's coming back here?"
Dwight,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing."
Toby,Yeah.
Holly,"Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends."
Erin,"Guys, who's Holly?"
Michael,"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City."
Michael,"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?"
Dwight,"Wait, what girlfriend?"
Erin,Wow.
Michael,I haven't told you about her.
Creed,She's one sassy black lady.
Dwight,I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Michael,"Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party."
Michael,"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, ""Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."""
Gabe,I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
Holly,I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Michael,"You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree."
Michael,I do. She is.
Dwight,Okay.
Michael,Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.
Michael,Cancel. We're canceling it.
Phyllis,So you went homemade this year.
Angela,"No, don't throw those out!"
Pam,Yup.
Michael,"No, we have to cancel the party."
Phyllis,"Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out."
Angela,We can save that.
Pam,"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion."
Michael,"No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new."
Phyllis,Are you good at homemade?
Andy,I bought these.
Pam,Look at this.
Michael,I know.
Phyllis,Yeah...
Andy,These cookies are fine.
Holly,"Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving."
Michael,It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Phyllis,"Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you."
Pam,"Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party."
Erin,That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
Michael,"Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine."
Michael,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting."
Pam,"I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen."
Toby,"No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do."
Michael,"You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work."
Michael,"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much."
Michael,"Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away."
Kevin,"Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself."
Michael,"We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow!"
Michael,It is Christmas.
Angela,Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
Angela,"No, it really seems like something Michael would do."
Michael,"Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa."
Michael,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed."
Angela,Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
Andy,Why would anyone frame you for that?
Michael,Okay. Sure.
Jim,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole ""Woody came to life"" thing so quickly?"
Angela,"I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party."
Michael,"Ahhhhhh! Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?"
Michael,You never know about the press.
Holly,You think this is funny?
Angela,"Well, I only ask because he's a senator."
Michael,I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Michael,Could he help us with some parking tickets?
Jim,Yikes.
Angela,I don't think that's appropriate.
Kevin,"Oh no, that's, that's not happening."
Michael,"Well, then he's not a senator."
Dwight,Dear God in heaven.
Angela,"Yes, he is."
Michael,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings."
Michael,Okay.
Holly,"Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore."
Jim,Hey.
Michael,"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought."
Pam,Hey.
Dwight,"Okay, hey, hey, hey..."
Jim,"We still doing the gifts today? I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party."
Jim,"No, fake girlfriends are always wrong."
Pam,"Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year."
Holly,You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
Jim,Me neither. Whew.
Michael,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, ""Michael, I love you, but I can't do this."" But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me."
Pam,Okay.
Holly,"Michael, I'm sorry."
Pam,"I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good."
Michael,And we did this whole stupid party for you.
Jim,
Erin,No.
Michael,"Okay... Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!"
Holly,"You guys, it wasn't my fault."
Pam,"No, it has the little..."
Kevin,"Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!"
Michael,"Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you."
Erin,I really think you're better off.
Bass Player,"Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott."
Michael,"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?"
Michael,"Yes, that's me. Come on it."
Erin,Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
Michael,"There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?"
Jim,"""Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese."" Damn it, Dwight!"
Pam,"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?"
Dwight,"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all."
Kevin,"I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party."
Stanley,"So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?"
Pam,Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
Toby,"No, they bring it in."
Andy,"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis."
Stanley,You lucky son of a bitch.
Kevin,Yeah.
Stanley,"I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life."
Andy,"I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup."
Jada,"Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office?"
Pam,"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him."
Darryl,"Sure, sweetie."
Andy,You know Darryl?
Pam,"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?"
Pam,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Pam,"Oh, my goodness."
Andy,"I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup."
Andy,I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
Pam,Cool.
Darryl,"Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!"
Darryl,"Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine."
Jada,What kind of challenges.
Justine,I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.
Andy,Wahhh...
Darryl,She did?
Pam,"Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?"
Justine,Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.
Andy,No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
Darryl,I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
Jada,I don't know.
Darryl,"Don't come in, I'm busy."
Andy,Do you know the other state?
Andy,"It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too."
Darryl,"Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold."
Pam,"Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck."
Andy,"The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear!"
Darryl,"Uh, no."
Darryl,And the game's over seconds later.
Andy,"Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back."
Angela,I'm so glad you could come.
Darryl,No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
Robert,It's nice. I know.
Pam,"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone."
Angela,"Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton."
Darryl,"Hey... You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it."
Robert,Hi.
Michael,"When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her."
Oscar,"Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar."
Erin,I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
Robert,Oscar. A pleasure.
Michael,"She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know."
Oscar,"Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor."
Erin,Oh...
AJ,Hi.
Toby,Hey.
Erin,Hello.
Michael,What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
AJ,"I'm, uh, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise."
Toby,"Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone."
Erin,"I know who you are, and I think you should go."
Kevin,"Hi, Toby."
Kevin,"I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?"
Meredith,What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
AJ,Was I supposed to bring you guys something?
Kevin,Yeah.
Holly,What? AJ!
Meredith,That scowl.
AJ,Surprise.
Toby,I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
Holly,"What are you doing here? Oh, my God."
Michael,"And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions."
AJ,I wanted to see you. How are you?
Toby,"I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking."
Holly,Wow! Nice.
Jim,
AJ,"Oh, God, you look great."
Dwight,You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave...
Holly,Oh... when did you get here?
Dwight,Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
AJ,Just now.
Jim,Stop! Stop!
Michael,Hey
Dwight,Ahh!
AJ,"Just now. Hey, Michael."
Jim,Oh... oh!
Michael,"Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome."
Dwight,
AJ,Pleased to see you. Thank you.
Dwight,I have no feeling in my fingers or pen1s. But I think it was worth it.
Michael,Good trip down?
Dwight,Haahh!!
AJ,"Yeah, it was great."
Jim,"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, then... ""How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight."""
Michael,"Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay."
Holly,Hi.
Michael,I am dead inside.
Erin,Hello.
Darryl,"What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies..."
Holly,"Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?"
Jada,You have a whole room of vending machines?
Erin,"I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive."
Creed,I know. Isn't it something?
Michael,"There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?"
Jada,I can't decide what I want.
Erin,"Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry."
Darrly,Merry Christmas.
Michael,Hello.
Jada,Merry Christmas.
Holly,"Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old b*st*rd."
Pam,Thank you.
Michael,"Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old b*st*rd."
Jada,And Merry Christmas.
Holly,"Well I did show my face around these parts, you old b*st*rd."
Meredith,Thank you.
Michael,"Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?"
Jada,And Merry Christ... mas.
Holly,I most certainly am.
Robert,Thank you so much.
Michael,"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!"
Jada,Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas.
Holly,Unnnnnnngh!
Oscar,Merry Christmas to you.
Michael,D'oh!
Jada,Merry Christmas.
Holly,"Oh, Homey."
Bass Player,"Oh, thank you."
Man,"Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting."
Holly,What's up?
Dwight,"Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!"
Michael,"Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there."
Jim,Oh.
Holly,"Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it."
Dwight,This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
Michael,"Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room."
Dwight,"Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us."
Creed,You think?
Jim,"I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on."
Michael,"And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax."
Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!"
Kevin,You were super mean.
Man,"Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence."
Michael,It was insensitive and I am sorry.
Dwight,"What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? Dwight, don't be bothered by the. Over the line, Jim."
Kevin,"It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again."
Jim,"I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here."
Michael,"I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line."
Dwight,"Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim."
Kevin,"Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life."
Jim,Sounds good.
Michael,You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
Dwight,Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Creed,"I don't think I'm there yet, Boss."
Jim,Smart.
Kevin,"Well, I am."
Dwight,And the rest was juststuff.
Michael,"Okay, oh! All right."
Man,"Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here."
Kevin,I'm going to help you.
Dwight,Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Michael,Okay.
Jim,"Oh, come on, that sounds awesome."
DJ,"Hey, uh. It's just you. Anything you want to hear?"
Member,It was pretty cool.
Andy,Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
Jim,Was it?
DJ,Okay.
Member,It was fun.
Andy,I said no hits!
Dwight,It was pretty awesome.
Ryan,"I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not..."
Jim,"Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now."
Kevin,"Hey, Ryan."
Michael,"January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this."
Ryan,Yeah.
Michael,"Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down."
Kevin,How's your fart project coming?
Michael,"Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not."
Ryan,"That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?"
Erin,"Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry."
Kevin,Me.
Michael,"Okay, so killing yourself. I was just thinking about snot."
Pam,"Kevin, don't! Come on!"
Angela,Good morning.
Kelly,"Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!"
Pam,"Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board."
Pam,"Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today."
Dwight,Wow. Did your baby draw that?
Meredith,"Well, if you don't have to do 'em..."
Angela,The glitter is blinding.
Kelly,"Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!"
Phyllis,I think it's good.
Ryan,"Okay, no."
Pam,It's gonna be fun.
Kelly,My resolution was to get more attention.
Pam,"I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome."
Ryan,"No, she's lying."
Phyllis,"I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?"
Kevin,"Hey, Ryan."
Erin,"Okay, champagne."
Erin,"One, two, three. I did it! I did a cartwheel!"
Michael,Happy.
Creed,you! you! God!
Erin,Sponge.
Pam,"Okay, that's it."
Michael,Sad. To soak up my tears.
Pam,Lesson learned.
Erin,Gummi bears and gummi worms.
Darryl,Sup?
Michael,"Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin."
Andy,Hey! Where did you go?
Erin,Ukulele's happy?
Darryl,To the arcade.
Michael,"Sad, something to break."
Andy,"Oh, cool."
Erin,Chocolates.
Darryl,"Why, did you meet someone?"
Michael,"For you, job well done."
Andy,"Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him."
Erin,Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
Darryl,"Right on, son."
Michael,Both sad.
Dwight,Gentlemen.
Erin,And did you get the tickets?
Andy,And where did you go?
Michael,"I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. ""Hey, you think you can do my job better?"" I don't know. ""What's your name?"" Michael."
Dwight,Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Erin,"I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!"
Darryl,Right.
Pam,"Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board."
DJ,"So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe."
Michael,Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
Dwight,Yeah!
Kelly,What happened? Is there a ring?
Erin,You want to keep this?
Michael,So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
Michael,No.
Kelly,Come on!
Erin,Do you want to keep this?
Holly,They're warm.
Michael,Yup.
Michael,"They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away."
Erin,Do you want to keep this?
Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever."
Michael,You can toss them.
Michael,"Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes."
Michael,My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
Kevin,Congratu-ohhh.
Holly,We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
Kelly,Wow.
Holly,"I just think we need to cool things down for awhile. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure."
Michael,Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
Michael,Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
Holly,"Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum."
Creed,Mmmhm.
Kelly,"Yes, I told everyone."
Michael,You ready to do this?
Holly,"Ha ha, ha ha!"
Creed,"Yes, sir."
Kevin,"Hey! Right back atcha, bitch!"
Michael,You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
Michael,"Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!"
Creed,"I really appreciate it, Boss."
Video Michael,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, calm down, breathe."
Michael,It's about you. It's about you. Go!
Michael,I'm trying!
Creed,I did it!
Video Michael,I said breathe!
Michael,You did?
Michael,I'm trying!
Creed,The perfect cartwheel.
Video Michael,"Wait a second, are you listening to music?"
Michael,Okay.
Michael,What?
Creed,What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
Video Michael,Shut that off!
Michael,"Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow."
Michael,I'm not listening to music!
Video Michael,"Fine, just go crazy for a little while! Lookin' good! You're lookin' good. Oh, I gotcha! I gotcha! I'm pulling you back! Michael dance off!"
Michael,"Go! Oh, that's nice."
Video Michael,Go!
Michael,Me? Okay.
Erin,Go!
Video Michael,Nice! We're gonna calm down later.
Michael,I'm good.
Erin,"Oh, yeah!"
Michael,Oh my God!
Pam,"Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards."
Dwight,Not doing that.
Pam,Why not?
Dwight,I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Andy,"Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine."
Pam,Learn to cook for one!
Andy,"Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so... two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one."
Pam,"Well, maybe you'll meet someone."
Andy,"No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad."
Pam,Angela.
Angela,Yes.
Pam,Make time for romance!
Oscar,Who's the senator?
Angela,My boyfriend.
Oscar,"Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'."
Angela,Ugh.
Dwight,"Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... My resolution is... meet a loose woman."
Angela,"Oh, God."
Andy,That's a good one.
Dwight,Yeah.
Andy,"You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too."
Dwight,Awesome.
Darryl,"You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. s*x already? Whoa...'"
Andy,The bookstore?
Dwight,It's that easy?
Darryl,"I'll come with you, show you how it's done."
Dwight,"Okay, I'll drive."
Darryl,"My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl."
Michael,"Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!"
Holly,Yeah.
Michael,That is neat.
Holly,I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
Michael,E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
Holly,Holly misses old phone.
Michael,Why?
Holly,New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
Michael,Bummer.
Holly,Bummer.
Michael,Reese's Pieces.
Holly,Reese's Pieces?
Kelly,"Oh, God, please stop!"
Michael,I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.
Holly,"Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right."
Michael,"Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?"
Pam,I don't think so.
Michael,"When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?"
Pam,No.
Michael,But you did still love him.
Pam,I'm not... I'm not going to have...
Michael,Do you love him now?
Pam,No! Just talk to her.
Michael,"No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend! Blegh."
Phyllis,"I'll talk to her, Michael."
Michael,You think she'd talk to you?
Phyllis,Why wouldn't she?
Michael,That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
Pam,There's a plan.
Andy,All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
Dwight,I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
Darryl,I got that cutie behind the counter.
Bookstore employee,"Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat."
Darryl,"Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once."
Bookstore employee,"Actually, it's ten thousand."
Darryl,"Holy, what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant."
Andy,Hi.
Customer,Hi.
Dwight,Welcome.
Andy,Let us know if you need anything.
Customer,Thanks.
Andy,Why did we pretend like we work here?
Dwight,Is that what we were doing?
Darryl,"Hey, how'd you do?"
Andy,Good!
Dwight,Good. Real good.
Darryl,Really?
Dwight,"Yeah, yeah!"
Andy,We kinda nailed it.
Dwight,"Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll."
Darryl,Cool.
Dwight,Okay. What'd you get?
Darryl,A book about oceans.
Dwight,"Oh, really? What else? Let me see."
Darryl,"No, that's uh. p0rn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... p0rn."
Phyllis,"Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?"
Erin,Want some company?
Holly,"Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?"
Phyllis,"Oh, really good, I went to Portugal."
Erin,I went to Portugal.
Holly,"Oh, wow... you went together?"
Phyllis,No.
Erin,No.
Phyllis,"So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?"
Holly,"Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together."
Phyllis,"You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?"
Holly,It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
Darryl,Whoa! Hold on.
Dwight,I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Darryl,"Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh."
Dwight,"Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time."
Darryl,"I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that."
Dwight,"Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women."
Andy,"Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink."
Darryl,What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
Andy,"I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties."
Dwight,"Chicks fall down, need help getting back up."
Andy,Roller derby practice!
Darryl,We're going skating.
Pam,The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Erin,"Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely."
Pam,Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre.
Gabe,Intercepted!
Erin,Hey! Gabe.
Gabe,Whoops.
Pam,Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
Creed,"I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel."
Pam,How is it going?
Creed,I'm having a little trouble motivating.
Pam,"One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February."
Michael,Or sooner.
Pam,Yeah.
Michael,That's not a joke.
Pam,"But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?"
Kevin,"Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none."
Pam,"Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine."
Michael,Is it?
Pam,"Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week."
Michael,"Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12"
Kevin,Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Michael,"What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!"
Creed,"Well, I can't, I don't know how."
Michael,You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
Creed,"My tombstone's already made, thank you."
Michael,Just do a cartwheel!
Erin,This is all I could find.
Michael,Eat it.
Pam,"You don't have to do that, Kevin."
Kevin,"I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael."
Kelly,Why are you eating stem first?
Kevin,"This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?"
Ryan,The other way.
Kevin,Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Michael,"No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go."
Pam,"Oh, Michael."
Michael,"Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it."
Kevin,"God, I hate it."
Michael,I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
Angela,All right!
Michael,Eat it!
Kelly,"You're killing him, Michael!"
Michael,"All right, all right, shh!"
Kevin,"All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?"
Michael,"Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. Oh, God! You guys are pathetic."
Kevin,"Can I get some candy, or something?"
Michael,No! You can't have any candy!
Oscar,I'll get him water.
Pam,"Okay, Michael, just settle down."
Michael,Holly Flax.
Holly,"Yes, Michael?"
Michael,"Not Michael, E.T."
David Brent,"Oh, sorry, mate."
Kelly,Yeah bitch.
Michael,"Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate."
Andy,Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
David,What you doing?
Michael,"No, no, no."
Michael,English?
Andy,"But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime."
David,"You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that."
Kelly,Whoo!
Michael,"Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?"
Tom,"Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda?"
David,"Yeah big time, yeah."
Jim,"Yeah, woah. Yep, absolutely, go ahead."
Michael,I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.
Tom,Hey.
David,"Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?"
Jim,Hey.
Michael,Michael Scott.
Tom,How's it goin'?
David,"Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li. That's what it sounds like."
Jim,Pretty good.
Michael,
Tom,It's been a while.
David,Herrow! Herrow!
Jim,"It has been, yeah."
Michael,I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
Tom,"So you work here, huh?"
David,You can't do that these days. You can't.
Jim,Sales.
Michael,"No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality."
Tom,Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory.
David,"No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said.. Ohh."
Jim,
Michael,That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
Tom,'Cause you're so smart.
David,Where are you working?
Jim,"Oh, man. You remember that, huh?"
Michael,Dunder Mifflin.
Tom,"Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius."
David,Any jobs now?
Jim,"All right, good catch-up."
Michael,"No, not right now."
Tom,Yeah.
David,Just let me know.
Jim,See ya.
Michael,All right. See you around.
Tom,"Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg?"
David,All right.
Dwight,Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
Michael,Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
Andy,"Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em."
Erin,"Your first student is here, Mister Bernard."
Holly,Wonderful seminar!
Andy,"That's actually ""Master of Ceremonies"" Bernard."
Michael,"Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on."
Andy,"Last year, I went to a seminar called ""The Ten Secrets of Real Estate"". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients."
Holly,"Michael, I should get back to work."
Erin,Oh it's...
Michael,What? Come on. It's time for grapes. Real fun day.
Michael,"Hello, I am here for the small business seminar."
Gabe,"So, I won."
Erin,Michael?
Erin,I know. You get to pick.
Michael,Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
Gabe,"Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch ""Wall-e""."
Erin,"Ooh. Wait, Michael?"
Erin,Yes?
Michael,Okay.
Gabe,"So I got us a compromise. This movie's called ""Hardware"". It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married..."
Michael,"I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character ""Mikanos"", is just a little added flava. ""Mikanos"" is loosely based on another character I do, ""Spiros"", who is more about the ladies."
Andy,"Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it."
Andy,Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
Erin,"There's a ""Shrek"" two?!"
Jim,"Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win."
Andy,"Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow."
Andy,Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
Gabe,Nice guy.
Jim,"Wow. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar."
Erin,Ohh.
Andy,"No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,"
Jim,I know.
Andy,"If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night."
Jim,I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
Andy,You can't. You can't.
Andy,"I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at."
Jim,Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
Pam,What's going on? Do you know that guy?
Jim,"I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office."
Dwight,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Dwight,How are the marks?
Dwight,What are some of your small business ideas?
Older guy,I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.
"Phyllis, Stanley, Dwight",Oooh!
Dwight,"That's great. There's a big, big future in that."
Phyllis,A lot of mines in Scranton.
Dwight,"Um, what about you?"
Younger Guy,"Uh, credit cards."
Dwight,Uh-huh.
Younger Guy,"My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction."
Dwight,Wow!
Younger Guy,"Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents."
Dwight,Right. Okay? Great.
Stanley,Great.
Dwight,You promised us whales. These are worms.
Andy,"They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter."
Stanley,I'm out.
Andy,"Stanley, you're suppose to close."
Phyllis,I'm out too.
Andy,What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
Dwight,We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
Michael,"You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and..."
Holly,"Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that."
Michael,Okay.
Michael,"Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it."
Michael,"If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?"
Holly,Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
Michael,Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
Holly,Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
Michael,"Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that."
Erin,"Down... there. Is ""jlp"" a word?"
Pam,"""Jelp?"" J-e-l-p?"
Erin,"No, j-l-p. Like, ""I jlp... I jlp you!"""
Pam,I don't think that's a word.
Erin,"I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game."
Erin,"The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen ""The Shining"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Ring"". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything."
Pam,You want some help?
Erin,Really?
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Erin,Yes.
Pam,"K-a. ""Ka""? What does ""ka"" mean?"
Oscar,"It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play ""moo""?"
Erin,"Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing ""moo"", I'm playing ""milk"". Whatever it takes."
Oscar,"Okay, but look, you could have hit ""mood"". Would have played a..."
Erin,Uh...
Oscar,A triple word.
Erin,Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
Oscar,Or moon.
Erin,The cow jumped over the moon.
Oscar,She's stuck on that one thing.
Pam,"No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?"
Andy,"Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy."
Kevin,"Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam."
Andy,"Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great."
Kevin,Then I won't let you down.
Kelly,Cake.
Ryan,In you go.
Andy,"Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?"
Ryan,Yup.
Andy,I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
Ryan,And?
Andy,Can you do it?
Ryan,Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Andy,So no?
Ryan,"No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment."
Kelly,"Oh, baby."
Andy,"What do I put you down for, bro hombre?"
Ryan,Yes.
Andy,All right!
Ryan,"Yes, I'll do it."
Andy,"Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome."
Ryan,"And if I flake, I flake."
Andy,What?
Andy,"Kevin, you open it up."
Kevin,Yep.
Andy,"Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed"
Kevin,Go.
Creed,Creed! Ha!
Andy,Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
Older Woman,Hi Nard Dog. I'm Lu Peachem.
Andy,"Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, ""Don't Just Dream it, do it."" Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone."
Kevin,Yes!
Kevin,There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Kevin,Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. And then double it!.
Andy,Are you okay?
Kevin,No. Yes!
Andy,Here...
Kevin,"No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner.. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!"
Andy,I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
Kelly,"But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend."
Andy,What are you...
Kelly,"Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch."
Kelly,"It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. ""The Business Bitch"", ""The Diet Bitch"", ""The Shopping Bitch"", ""The Etiquette Bitch."""
Kelly,"I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing."
Professor Powell,"Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise."
Kelly,"Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone."
Professor Powell,"Uh, why?"
Kelly,Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
Professor Powell,"Um, there aren't really ten secrets."
Kelly,"Come on Scott, please? It's me."
Professor Powell,"Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline."
Kelly,Mm-hmm.
Andy,That brilliant little bitch.
Oscar,"A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that ""q"" right there."
Erin,Wait. Why?
Oscar,"Put the ""q"" there, sweetie."
Pam,I think there's better...
Oscar,"Put the ""q"" there! Sorry I yelled."
Pam,You could have just told us what you were thinking.
Oscar,There's no theater in that.
Pam,"There's no yelling in that, either."
Oscar,Well...
Holly,What do you do in your free time?
Michael,Practice Olympics.
Holly,Mmm. Do you like movies?
Michael,"I like the musical ""Grease"", or as we call it, ""home""."
Holly,We have to try this out on somebody.
Michael,Hello.
Hank,"Look, you want to order something?"
Michael,She will have a greekaccino.
Hank,I don't know what that is.
Michael,It...
Holly,It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
Michael,I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
Holly,No more brain damage.
Michael,No more brain damage!
Holly,Ahh!
Holly,I don't know.
Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton."
Creed,"Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a pen1s. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question"
Andy,"Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour."
Gabe,"I picked out our movie. It's called ""Suspiria"". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down."
Erin,When I win...
Gabe,Ooh.
Erin,"We're gonna watch ""Wall-e"", where all the boundaries of color are pushed."
Gabe,"It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some ""Slumdog Millionaire"" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible."
Dwight,So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
Guy,"Well, I started my own golf supply company."
Dwight,Really?
Guy,"It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth."
Dwight,Phyllis?
Phyllis,Hmm?
Dwight,Some of these people are for real.
Dwight,"Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you."
Andy,Thank you.
Dwight,"Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?"
Andy,Really?
Darryl,Ahem!
Andy,Excuse me.
Dwight,I got it. I got it.
Andy,"Hey, do you need a lozenge?"
Darryl,They're a bunch of jackals.
Andy,What?
Darryl,"They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home."
Andy,
Andy,"Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?"
Dwight,You're gonna blow it.
Andy,Maybe. Only maybe.
Oscar,We got it! Wow! We got it!
Pam,"Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself."
Oscar,"Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes."
Erin,Yes.
Oscar,"Ah. No!. Although I must say, I will have ""apoplexy"" if you lose. Do you understand? ""Apoplexy"" is what I will have."
Erin,Apoplexy.
Oscar,Yes.
Erin,"Got it. Oh, Oscar. Oscar?"
Erin,"I played ""ape."""
Jim,I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
Andy,"Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so..."
Michael,"Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. All, you have to close right now."
Andy,"Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it."
Michael,"No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it."
Andy,"Yeah, yeah."
Michael,"Andy, what's the problem?"
Andy,This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
Michael,"You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. What is taking that guy so long?"
Jim,Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
Pam,I don't know. They're still in there.
Jim,Ohh! Good-bye.
Pam,Stop. Out with it.
Pam,"Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom."
Jim,"Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually."
Pam,"And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group."
Jim,"I was blue group, so it was second from the top."
Pam,And Tom...
Jim,Was in the green group.
Pam,"And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence."
Jim,And that's what I told him.
Pam,Right. But how'd you say it?
Jim,"""My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with."""
Andy,"Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?"
Older Woman,I'll take one.
Andy,"Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? Sold! Anybody else? Yes! All right!"
Kelly,"Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement."
Gabe,"Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive."
Erin,Oh my gosh!
Darryl,"You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people."
Phyllis,Wow.
Gabe,Hey...
Kelly,"Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced."
Stanley,"Click the ""x"""
Meredith,Sweet! Free Ring!
Phyllis,I'm clicking!
Andy,Divorced?
Stanley,In the box.
Ryan,"Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides."
Phyllis,I am clicking.
Kelly,The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
Stanley,"Woman, you've had a computer for years!"
Pam,Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
Andy,Phyllis!
Kelly,"We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot."
Gabe,Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
Ryan,It's not irrelevant. Details
Andy,Oooohhh.
Kelly,"And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said..."
Gabe,"""Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat."""
Ryan and Kelly,I don't think I should be married to you anymore.
Kevin,Nice!
Kevin,What?
Gabe,"No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs."
Andy,"Sorry, when did you get married?"
Andy,Do the next one.
Kelly,"Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right."
Gabe,"""Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'"
Andy,And you didn't invite any of us?
Darryl,Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
Ryan,"We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time."
Gabe,"Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?"
Kelly,"God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake."
Phyllis,"Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?"
Ryan,"No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married."
Gabe,"Umm... ""You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here."" Ha."
Oscar,"You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married."
Oscar,"That's tasteless, Gabe."
Ryan,"No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!"
Gabe,Tasteless?
Kelly,"Ryan, I changed my mind."
Oscar,Tasteless.
Ryan,"Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?"
Gabe,"More tasteless than this...""is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it."""
Kelly,And who is on my side?
Pam,"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner."
Jim,All right. Bye.
Phyllis,Yes.
Pam,Bye.
Kevin,"Yes, well done!"
Jim,Let's Go!
Oscar,Who's is it? Who wrote that?
Michael,Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Phyllis,"Yeah, who wrote it?"
Holly,For what?
Angela,Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
Michael,You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
Erin,"Where did he go, Holly?"
Holly,Don't you have a sales call to go on?
Holly,I have no idea.
Michael,"I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?"
Dwight,"Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, ""this way, this way""?"
Holly,We don't know that.
Holly,I don't know.
Michael,Sure we do.
Dwight,"Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!"
Holly,Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
Holly,"Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all."
Michael,Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Dwight,All right then. Someone propose a plan.
Holly,"Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that."
Erin,Okay. We fan out...
Michael,"Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree."
Dwight,"Not you, Erin."
Holly,Well you don't have to agree.
Holly,"Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below."
Michael,Yes I do.
Dwight,That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Holly,No you don't.
Holly,"Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him."
Michael,Yes I do.
Erin,Good. We don't need her.
Holly,"No, you can have your own opinion."
Dwight,"Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling."
Michael,I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
Holly,Michael?
Jim,He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
Michael,Hi. How did you know I was up here?
Pam,"Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny ""Jim"" game."
Holly,What are you doing up here?
Jim,That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
Michael,I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Pam,"All right, what'd you do?"
Holly,Dunder Mifflin.
Jim,"Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art."
Michael,Yeah. Wow. I just miss you so much.
Pam,Where'd you put it?
Holly,I missed you too.
Jim,Where'd I put what?
Michael,Really?
Michael,Let's go.
Holly,Yeah.
Jim,"Oh, sorry gotta go."
Michael,Can I kiss you?
Pam,Say it. Where?
Holly,Yeah.
Jim,"Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer."
Michael,Okay.
Pam,The fridge.
Phyllis,Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
Jim,"Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance."
Gabe,"Uh, it was."
Pam,"The fridge, got it."
Meredith,Maybe it wasn't.
Jim,And the final clue...
Gabe,"""Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe."""
Michael,Let's go!
Andy,Oh!
Jim,"You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine."
Phyllis,"No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going."
Pam,Bye.
Gabe,"""I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull. ""Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo."""
Erin,Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
Andy,
Jim,Cheer up. We made a sale.
Gabe,"""Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her."""
Michael,Just drive faster. I want to get back.
Phyllis,"Yeah, there you go."
Jim,"Well, I'm going the speed limit. So..."
Michael,"Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit."
Jim,Someone's in a bad mood.
Michael,"No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?"
Jim,"Alright, let me turn on some music."
Michael,I need to pee.
Jim,No you don't.
Michael,"Yeah, I do. My word against yours."
Jim,Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
Michael,"What part of ""I need to pee"" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car."
Jim,"Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over."
Michael,Well I hope I make it.
Jim,Hello?
Helen,"Hi Jim, it's Helen."
Jim,Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
Helen,Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.
Jim,Ok...
Helen,A tiny thing. I locked her in the car.
Jim,What?
Helen,She's smiling. She's happy.
Jim,Oh my God.
Helen,"Jim, I don't have a spare key."
Jim,"Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?"
Guy,Hello?
Pam,This is Pam.
Jim,"Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok."
Pam,What's wrong?
Jim,Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Pam,"Jim, what?"
Jim,"Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car."
Pam,Oh God! What?!
Jim,"No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra."
Pam,Ok. She's ok?
Jim,"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet."
Pam,Understood.
Jim,And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
Pam,"Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a ""Ask Pam Beasley"". ... Did the phone cut off?"
Jim,Nope.
Pam,"Alright, just call me after the doctor."
Jim,Ok. Bye.
Pam,Bye.
Michael,"I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted."
Attendant,"No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away."
Michael,There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
Attendant,Just make it quick.
Michael,"Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?"
Attendant,You don't know it.
Michael,"You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number."
Attendant,He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away.
Michael,"Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok."
Holly,It's the gas station on Benet Street?
Pam,Yeah.
Holly,Ok.
Erin,You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
Holly,Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
Erin,It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
Dwight,"Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat."
Pam,"Cute. Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good."
Oscar,Which on in particular?
Andy,"Yeah, which one?"
Pam,"Well the first one has a surprise factor. ""I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"""
Andy,Boo-yea!
Gabe,No no. No no no.
Pam,"But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line."
Oscar,You suppose?
Darryl,What's it say?
Oscar,"""I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again."""
Gabe,Ok. No no no.
Kevin,Red gloves.
Darrly,Keep it real.
Pam,"You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging."
Darryl,And I will take you all down.
Andy,You?
Darryl,I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason
Andy,Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
Pam,"Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes."
Andy,Woo-hoo.
Kevin,I can't wait.
Dwight,Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type
Erin,He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
Attendant,"Yeah, he just left."
Holly,Which way did he go?
Dwight,"Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way."
Holly,Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
Attendant,She's right. He went that way.
Dwight,Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. Let's ride.
Michael,Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? I'm being serious. Seriously.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
Dwight,Has Michael checked in?
Pam,"Oh, hey Dwight."
Dwight,I asked you a question.
Pam,"No, he hasn't."
Dwight,Goodbye.
Pam,"No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought..."
Dwight,"Pam, this isn't a shopping trip."
Erin,No.
Dwight,This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Pam,"Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out..."
Dwight,"Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up."
Pam,"Ok, well it wasn't obvious so..."
Dwight,No word from Michael.
Holly,Oh.
Pam,Ta-da!
Kevin,"Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island."
Oscar,Ok. I got one.
Pam,Yeah?
Oscar,Yes!
Gabe,"Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down."
Office,Boo!
Meredith,Why?
Gabe,Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
Darryl,"Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game."
Gabe,"Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for."
Oscar,Irony is such a critical...
Gabe,Number two
Pam,Seriously?
Oscar,Wow.
Gabe,"I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other."
Darryl,"Wrap it up, Gabe."
Gabe,"Ok final thing, and this is a fun one"
Gabe,Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. Not every day.
Gabe,Go get 'em. Start quipin'.
Oscar,"Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM."
Pam,Oh! Ok.
Darryl,Send me one too.
Andy,"Yeah, yeah. Put me on that."
Phyllis,C.C
Kevin,Ditto.
Michael,"Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog."
Hot Dog Guy,I'm not a pawn shop.
Michael,Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
Hot Dog Guy,Wow.
Michael,With that I can buy... half the menu.
Hot Dog Guy,I can't just go giving away hot dogs.
Michael,All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
Hot Dog Guy,Throw 'em away.
Michael,"Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?"
Hot Dog Guy,No.
Michael,Okay. You've just lost my business.
Dwight,Hey.
Erin,"Hey, you were in there forever."
Dwight,There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
Erin,She wandered off like an idiot.
Dwight,Hey!
Holly,Hey.
Dwight,What are you doing?
Holly,"Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go. I'll take my free stress ball too now."
Cell Phone Sales Person,"Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original."
Holly,What?
Cell Phone Sales Person,You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.
Dwight,Tootenbacher.
Erin,Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
Dwight and Erin,farts popcorn.
Dwight,"Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?"
Holly,Are their egg rolls really that big?
Michael,"Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?"
Waiter,No problem.
Michael,Okay. I'll be right back.. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
Waiter,So you can't pay for your food?
Michael,"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing."
Waiter,You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much.
Michael,Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
Waiter,Mr. Chu!
Micahel,"Okay, all right. You know what?"
Waiter,You were trying to steal food from us?
Michael,I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
Waiter,You can't. We'll stop you.
Michael,"Well, I think I can get through the door."
Dwight,"Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian..."
Erin,It's Michael!
Waiter,He just left.
Erin,You knew.
Holly,What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
Dwight,"Uncanny. Put a pin in that. Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?"
Waiter,I think he was heading downtown.
Dwight,He's heading downtown.
Gabe,"So what, no one's even gonna try?"
Pam,Guess not.
Pam,Hey. How you doing?
Holly,"No, don't touch."
Darryl,Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
Michael,"No, we can't."
Pam,Yeah.
Holly,No touching.
Darryl,She was about to turn 97.
Michael,"No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you."
Pam,"At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you."
Holly,Oh.
Darryl,"Thank you. ""Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted."" ""Have fun today, big guy."" ""Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop."""
Michael,Oh.
Pam,It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
Holly,Almost got you.
Darryl,"""Hooray. Live it up big D. "" ""Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this""?"
Michael,"Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh."
Andy,Birthday punches! One two three four five sice seven eight!
Holly,You're not touching me.
Pam,I'm so sorry.
Michael,I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
Darryl,
Oscar,"Okay, this is much worse than before."
Andy,...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
Kevin,"Yeah, I agree. This is nasty."
Andy,...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
Michael,Grab you here.
Darryl,Rachel from the party?
Holly,And here.
Andy,"Oh, yeah!"
Michael,I will grab you here anyway.
Darryl,Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow!
Gabe,You have to cut it out.
Phyllis,"Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene."
Holly,Okay.
Holly,"Okay, bye. Okay, bye. I'll miss you."
Michael,Never.
Michael,Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
Holly,You said you would.
Holly,Bye.
Michael,"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained."
Michael,"Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye."
Gabe,"No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One"
Holly,"Okay, one more quick one."
Holly,"No, I don't think so."
Michael,Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
Gabe,Number two
Michael,"Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you."
Michael,"Yes, it was that. It's that one."
Gabe,And what do we have here?
Holly,Yes. Number three.
Erin,From my secret admirer. That's you!
Holly,Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
Gabe,Come on.
Michael,We're not supposed to PDA.
Gabe,I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
Holly,Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
Erin,"""Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue."" Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!"
Michael,I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
Gabe,"Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck."
Holly,Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
Erin,"But, there's no clue."
Michael,That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
Gabe,"Well, get to work."
Holly,We weren't in love last time.
Erin,"I can't, 'cause there's no clue."
Michael,I was in love with you.
Gabe,The puzzle is the clue.
Holly,I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
Erin,Oh.
Michael,
Oscar,
Erin,"Oh. One Erin Special, please."
Michael,Are these numbers correct?
Hank,Here's your bottle of sparkling cider.
Oscar,"The numbers are correct, Michael."
Andy,Hey.
Michael,Okay.
Erin,That's my favorite.
Oscar,
Hank,I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some in the break room when you're through.
Michael,"Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out."
Kevin,"Hey, buck up, buddy!"
Oscar,I jus... I just need a signature.
Darryl,Make that face he likes.
Jim,There you go. Thanks.
Dwight,Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
Pam,How much did you give him?
Michael,It's like a time bomb...
Jim,Big tip.
Dwight,Shh.
Pam,Wait. I don't have my scarf.
Michael,"...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging."
Jim,What?
Dwight,Just hush.
Pam,I'm missing my scarf. Oh.
Michael,Sexual time bomb.
Jim,We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
Dwight,Just rock. Shh.
Pam,"Yeah, lunch was wonderful!"
Michael,Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
Jim,Shh.
Dwight,Movie idea?
Pam,"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?"
Michael,No. Saving the world has never been this hard.
Jim,"Um, bottomless champagne."
Dwight,Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
Pam,"Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?"
Michael,"No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending."
Jim,No.
Dwight,Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
Erin,Psst! Psst!
Kevin,Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
Andy,What's up?
Dwight,I don't know.
Erin,Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
Michael,Do the monkey face.
Andy,Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
Dwight,Do the monkey face!
Erin,Okay.
Michael,I love that. I love that face.
Andy,"But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably..."
Dwight,Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
Erin,"Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends."
Michael,No. The monkey!
Andy,"Well, okay then."
Dwight,Go back to the monkey!
Erin,Yes!
Michael,Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
Andy,At least until Stanley calms down.
Dwight,Hurl your feces.
Erin,"Oh, is he..."
Michael,That's good.
Andy,D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku.
Dwight,Good.
Erin,Andy.
Michael,That's good. He's throwing it.
Jim,"All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you."
Dwight,They really do that.
Dwight,"Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really."
Michael,I know.
Jim,Wait.
Erin,B-9.
Dwight,You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
Andy,B-9.
Jim,"Aww, nuts."
Erin,Like a benign tumor.
Angela,"I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA."
Andy,"Maybe it's just more like, ""be mine."""
Oscar,Yes! The freaking PDA!
Erin,"Oh, yes. There's a note. ""A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss."""
Angela,Uh-huh.
Andy,Mm.
Oscar,"Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them."
Erin,Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm
Angela,No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
Andy,Hmm.
Oscar,"Yes, yes, absolutely."
Michael,Holly. Hey.
Angela,...but it's totally inappropriate.
Holly,Hi.
Darryl,"Yeah, it's a little much."
Michael,"Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up."
Phyllis,Mm-hmm.
Holly,What? What are you talking about?
Darryl,"Obviously, so happy for them both."
Michael,"Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
Oscar,So happy. Yeah.
Holly,"No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me."
Kevin,"I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because..."
Michael,"You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's..."
Angela,"No, stop! Just don't."
Holly,What if I said it wasn't up to them?
Oscar,Kevin!
Michael,Who?
Kevin,Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Holly,"The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me."
Everyone,
Michael,Okay. Okay.
Angela,God! Kevin!
Michael,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!"
Erin,So tell me about your new girlfriend.
Oscar,Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Andy,"She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there."
Kevin,"Better luck next time, pal."
Erin,"Aww, cute."
Michael,"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu."
Andy,"Hey, look at that. Done."
Holly,You do?
Erin,That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
Michael,I do.
Andy,I wish you well on your quest.
Oscar,Go on. Kiss each other already.
Erin,"No, come on."
Kevin,"Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you."
Andy,"Aww, I mean..."
Oscar,I just told them to do it!
Erin,Come on!
Jim,What?
Andy,Okay.
Pam,No.
Erin,Ha!
Jim,No. We took a walk.
Gabe,"I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just... like it's coming from my own head."
Pam,We took a walk.
Michael,"Sit. Okay, just close your eyes."
Dwight,"My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago."
Holly,Ohh. Can you get lower?
Ryan,Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
Michael,"Oh, yeah."
Kelly,"Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me..."
Holly,A little lower.
Kevin,"Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with."
Holly,I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes s*x. He can put both his legs behind his head.
Michael,What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
Gabe,Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
Holly,
Michael,
Gabe,Yes?
Michael,"Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?"
Gabe,"Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace."
Michael,Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
Gabe,"First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances."
Ryan,"Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting."
Meredith,"Uh, I also don't see Andy."
Kevin,Oooh.
Jim,OOH! Boom! Face!
Gabe,"I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam."
Pam,Yeah. What? Us?
Gabe,They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
Jim,Did it!
Pam,Yeah!
Jim,Love it. Keep it goin.
Gabe,"Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh..."
Kevin,Booby honking.
Gabe,"Yeah, booby honking. Sure."
Kevin,Butt honking.
Gabe,"Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking."
Creed,"The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap..."
Gabe,"Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem."
Oscar,Are you guys listening to this?
Michael,"What, are you talking about me and Holly?"
Pam,Yeah!
Gabe,Maybe you find your own chair.
Holly,So we kiss occasionally.
Oscar,Not occasionally. All the time.
Phyllis,"Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering."
Stanley,The flirtatious tickling.
Michael,Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
Darryl,That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
Michael,"I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it."
Dwight,Michael. Confession
Michael,Thank you.
Dwight,I've had intercourse in the office.
Michael,All right.
Dwight,As has Angela!
Angela,Dwight!
Dwight,As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. As has Michael and as has Holly.
Kevin,As has Kevin!
Angela,With who?
Kevin,She goes to another school.
Michael,Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
Oscar,Good.
Michael,You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
Angela,No.
Michael,Anything goes.
Oscar,Just leave it how you said...
Dwight,"Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?"
Michael,"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?"
Dwight,And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
Michael,Pro.
Dwight,Yes!
Michael,What? Problem solved.
Michael,"No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises."
Pam,"That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have s*x in the office. That's where you work, right?"
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Pam,"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had s*x there, except for you and him."
Jim,Ew.
Erin,Don't mind us. You keep working.
Darryl,Okay. I'll keep working.
Erin,"Oh, my God. It's a song."
Andy,Whoa.
Erin,What do you think is on it?
Andy,We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
Erin,Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
Andy,I think he can hear us.
Andy,"That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level."
Erin,Darryl.
Andy,Darryl is a jerk.
Erin,"No, he's not."
Andy,"No, I'm just testing if he can hear."
Darryl,I can hear you.
Andy,Oh. Okay.
Erin,Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Boom Box,The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.
Andy,The temp at night?
Erin,What do you...
Darryl,You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
Andy,Pi...
Darryl,Pick it up.
Andy,Okay.
Darryl,Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
Andy,Right. Okay.
Holly,Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
Michael,"Ah, the old ""leave behind."" Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working."
Holly,"Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable."
Michael,"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt."
Holly,"Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable."
Michael,"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop."
Holly,Okay.
Michael,Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
Michael,"Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day."
Holly,Two people in love?
Michael,I love you.
Holly,"Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, ""oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl."" Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?"
Michael,I love you-love you.
Holly,"Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you."
Michael,I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.
Holly,I love you.
Michael,"Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me."
Andy,"Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?"
Erin,I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
Andy,"Oh, or maybe not."
Erin,Oh. Cool.
Andy,How romantic is this?
Erin,Super romantic.
Andy,Right. Do you see a clue or...
Erin,Yeah. Did you not see it?
Andy,"Oh, my gosh."
Erin,Hanks.
Jim and Pam,Hey!
Andy and Erin,Hey.
Andy,No time to chat.
Erin,Sorry.
Jim,"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here."
Ryan,Hey. You're looking for me?
Pam,"Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey."
Ryan,No you weren't.
Pam,"No, we weren't."
Ryan,You wanted to have s*x in my office.
Pam,No.
Jim,Definitely not. That's disgusting.
Ryan,No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
Jim,"Hey, you don't have to..."
Pam,That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.
Jim,That was really rough.
Pam,Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have s*x in the office.
Jim,"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place."
Pam,"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed."
Jim,And a shower.
Michael,"Hello, Holly."
Holly,Hello.
Michael,"Here, shake. No!"
Delivery Guy,I got a delivery for ya'.
Michael,Leave it at reception.
Delivery,I'm supposed to deliver this one in person.
Michael,Clean up on aisle five.
Michael,"After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level"
Michael,Erin... what are you doing?
Erin,"Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it."
Michael,"That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth."
Jim,Threat Level
Pam,"We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie."
Jim,"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!"
Pam,"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy."
Pam,We'd love to see it!
Michael,"Sweet, I will go invite Holly."
Pam,"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?"
Creed,Thanks mom.
Holly,You never told me you made a movie.
Michael,"Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom."
Holly,It's got you.
Michael,It's got a lot of me.
Holly,I can't wait.
Michael,"Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level"
Narrator,"Michael Scarn, well that's an interesting story. He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story."
Samuel,Master Scarn.
Dwight,"I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- to be like this! But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person."
Michael,Dwight does not play a robot.
Samuel,
Michael,I'm up.
Samuel,It's the president. He needs you for a mission.
Michael,Tell him I'm retired.
Dwight,It's Goldenface.
Michael,"Goldenface, this makes it personal."
President,"Scarn, you're right on time."
Daryl,I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
President,"It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL All Star Game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn, this one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan."
Samuel,We have to search the stadium.
President,"Not so fast, Goldenface has taken all the concession stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages, and save the game?"
Michael,"Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. Heads. Tails....Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails. Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five."
Narrator,"Well, the hostages were scared."
Kevin,Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us.
Goldenface,"Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I kill everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good."
Jim,I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Narrator,"Well, the All Star Game was three days away, so naturally it was all sold out. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that, Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a Slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer... Cherokee Jack."
Cherokee Jack,Mop the ice.
Michael,"I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey."
Cherokee Jack,Mop it. Now take this.
Michael,What am I supposed to do with this?
Cherokee Jack,Mop.
Narrator,"Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country."
Ryan,"Each year, the National Hockey League selects one civilian amateur to play in the All Star Game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. On your marks, get set..."
Goldenface,Die!
Michael,"Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me."
Goldenface,"I wasn't trying to kill you, I was trying to slow you down."
Michael,No!
Goldenface,Oh by the way!
Michael,Yeah?
Goldenface,How's your wife doing?
Michael,
Michael,Congratulations.
Oscar,"Hey, you came in second. Not bad either."
Michael,I am sorry that I have to do this...
Oscar,Huh...
Michael,I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Samuel,"I'm intercepting a name. Jasmine Winsong. She works for Goldenface. What I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat."
Michael,"Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town."
Samuel,Oh-
Dwight,He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
Jan,They call me Jasmine Winsong.
Michael,Bingo.
Jan,"He finished his movie? No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him."
Jan,
Michael,
Jan,The hostages are under the stadium.
Michael,Jack Blaise.
Pam,You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!
Goldenface,Ha! This is gonna show them that I mean business. See ya!
Michael,"By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story."
Samuel,Ha!
Kevin,Michael Scarn!
Goldenface,"Sorry about your friend, Scarn!"
Michael,"The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist."
Goldenface,
Samuel,"We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?"
Goldenface,Hm?
Samuel,"We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?"
Goldenface,Hm?
Samuel,We've searched the wh- ok...
Michael,"He said, where is the bomb?"
Goldenface,In the puck!
Michael,Why are you telling me this?
Goldenface,Because I'm going to kill you. Unless! You forgive me for murdering your wife.
Michael,Hey Goldenface.
Goldenface,Yeah?
Michael,Go puck yourself!
Goldenface,
Samuel,Noooo!
Michael,That was not scripted.
Goldenface,
Michael,More Tylenol.
Helene,You've already had four.
Pam,"Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God... So good."
Helene,You're lucky to be alive.
Michael,"It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn."
Helene,Let's just make sure that everything's... Working properly...
President,You just said the bomb... is in the puck?
Michael and Samuel together,Yes.
President,Is that where you hid the bomb Goldenface?
Goldenface,
Samuel,But why would you blow up the stadium? You OWN the stadium!
Michael,For the insurance money! I knew it all along! You will never get away with this!
Michael,"Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up."
Narrator,"It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't of course, He just wasn't using it right now."
Michael,Beer me Billy.
Billy,"You don't looks so good, what's got ya down?"
Michael,I got problems Billy. Big problems...
Billy,"You got problems?! My TV don't work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what's-a-whosit, I can't even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what's worse than that?"
Michael,Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
Billy,I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink.
Karen,"Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby?"
Karen,"Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?"
Michael,I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy.
Billy,"I'm gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox!"
Michael,"No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died."
Billy,"There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn."
Michael,"Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!"
Todd Packer,"If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on Earth!"
Jim,Sorry.
Michael,
Jim,"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back."
Kelly,Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
Kevin,It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Ryan,You should enter it in festivals!
Kevin,Or carnivals!
Michael,"Well that's a... pretty good reaction. Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?"
Holly,Uh... which part?
Michael,"Okay. No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough..."
Andy,Some people are really popping on screen!
Michael,Hey.
Holly,Hey! Good movie.
Michael,"Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!"
Holly,I loved it.
Michael,Did you? What did you love about it?
Holly,"Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?"
Michael,"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly."
Holly,Uhm...
Michael,"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded."
Holly,Not worried about that.
Michael,"It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream."
Holly,Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Michael,"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus."
Holly,Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Michael,"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing."
Holly,"Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?"
Michael,"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie."
Holly,I'm real.
Michael,"Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you."
Holly,I love you too.
Michael,"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans."
Michael,Who likes Threat Level
Samuel,Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode!
Michael,"I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!"
Samuel,Cherokee Jack? Michael he died.
Michael,This one's for you Cherokee Jack.
Michael,"We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states."
Jim,"That's fine, it's great!"
Michael,"No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they, they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there."
Pam,Why is your face gold?
Goldenface,Why do you care?
Pam,I'm just making conversation.
Goldenface,"I worked in a gold factory, we had a boss, who only cared about money..."
Michael,Hey...
Holly,"Hey, I'm sorry. It is good."
Michael,"No it's not. It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it."
Hostage,"Please Goldenface, let us go!"
Michael,Cherokee Jack.
Cherokee Jack,"I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck."
Michael,
Michael,
Samuel,Yah!
Billy,Hey! We got sports games again!
Goldenface,Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh-
Michael,Some breakfast for me and some breakfast for you.
Michael,"Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot."
Michael,I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!
President,"Michael, it's the president."
Michael,Hello sir.
President,I need you for another mission.
Michael,Ugh... I'm in.
Andy,Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
Michael,Oh yeah! Yes he is!
Dwight,"No no, he's doing it to catch the president!"
Michael,"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid."
Narrator,"Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn. Well because I AM Michael Scarn."
Rapper,"Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!"
Dwight,I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Kelly,"Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology."
Kevin,You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
Michael,"Okay, go back to the annex."
Dwight,They're still good for another week.
Kelly,This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Meredith,"You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like."
Ryan,Sometimes you over react.
Kevin,I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes.
Oscar,"Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one."
Dwight,Hardy har har. Okay picture this
Todd,"Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius."
Jim,"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging."
Michael,"That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-"
Dwight,"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months."
Angela,No! Don't!
Jim,Three months.
Michael,"I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!"
Dwight,Could be.
Pam,"So listen, we have to really scuff this up."
Jim,Four months.
Andy,"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry."
Dwight,"I can see that happening, yes."
Pam,"Andy, this is the deal we made."
Jim,Eight months?
Andy,That's probably good. That's enough.
Dwight,That's a realistic time line.
Pam,We should break this hinge maybe.
Jim,Eleven months.
Andy,Let's not go crazy.
Dwight,Perhaps.
Todd,"Well thanks, will do."
Jim,Okay now really think hard about this one
Jim,"Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool."
Dwight,I can see that as a very real possibility.
Todd,That sounds weird.
Jim,Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Jim,"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!"
Dwight,I can see that happening.
Dwight,And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Jim,Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
Jim,Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Todd,I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
Dwight,Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Michael,Still not seeing the problem here.
Todd,"Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd."
Todd,"All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!"
Dwight,Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Michael,"It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly."
Michael,What are you doing?
Holly,Hi!
Jim,"All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!"
Michael,Hi.
Michael,"I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?"
Holly,You must be Todd.
Jim,He's a jerk.
Todd,"Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!"
Dwight,He took my desk.
Holly,Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Michael,"Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?"
Todd,After you!
Dwight,"It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas."
Michael,"Oh, Michael! This'll be just us."
Michael,You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Michael,"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots."
Dwight,"No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing."
Holly,All right.
Michael,"He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him."
Michael,And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Jim,Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about?
Holly,I already have.
Andy,"Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?"
Michael,Whoa!
Pam,Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Jim,Why is Packer back?
Andy,"Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?"
Michael,Is Packer here?
Pam,"Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse."
Dwight,Why's he talking to Holly?
Andy,"All right, well thank you for my garbage computer."
Michael,"Don't know, don't care."
Todd,"You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the ""ass"", in Tallahassee!"
Holly,"Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves."
Michael,"Yes, about that."
Todd,Oh!
Todd,"Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!"
Michael,"Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms."
Michael,Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
Kevin,Yes!
Todd,Do you have a ball and chain?
Jim,What!?
Michael,"No, nothing like that at all."
Todd,"It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!"
Todd,"Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight."
Kevin,Nice! We got burned!
Michael,Sorry?
Michael,"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out."
Todd,"I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local talent."
Dwight,"Holly, you approved this?"
Michael,Sounds great.
Holly,"Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff."
Todd,It's gonna be so good.
Jim,You did approve it?
Michael,That is. It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
Holly,Yeah.
Holly,I'm sorry about your friend.
Kevin,What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Michael,"Nah, he's an ass."
Kevin,I have very little patience for stupidity.
Holly,You ahh.
Erin,Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Michael,You ahh.
Gabe,I'm such a klutz!
Holly,What ah you wicked smaht?
Erin,"Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!"
Michael,No you ahh.
Pam,"I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! Right?"
Holly,Who ahh?
Erin,Thank you Pam.
Michael,You ahh.
Pam,"Awwh, you're welcome. My pleasure."
Daryl,So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Jim,Can I do something for ya?
Pam,Yep. Lucked out.
Pam,I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Daryl,"Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse."
Jim,"Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so..."
Pam,"Yep, super lucky."
Pam,So you know the feeling.
Daryl,Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
Michael,Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
Pam,"Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there."
Dwight,I didn't order anything.
Daryl,Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Michael,And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Pam,Three.
Dwight,Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Pam,I'm full on corrupt!
Michael,"So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here."
Todd,"Thanks man, it'd mean a lot."
Dwight,"I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael."
Todd,well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
Dwight,No it is not.
Todd,Is too!
Michael,Let's look at this.
Todd,Check it out!
Dwight,I don't wanna move desks!
Michael,Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Jim,Do I have any say in this?!
Michael,No!
Todd,"Don't even watch, Halpert!"
Dwight,"Hey, who's dirt box is this?"
Holly,"Oh, that's our Zen garden."
Dwight,"What do you grow in here, bullcrap?"
Pam,"Hey, um..."
Holly,"Hey, what's up guys?"
Meredith,"Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!"
Jim,"Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?"
Holly,Uhm.
Pam,He's seriously awful!
Holly,"Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!"
Meredith,That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Jim,Why are you nodding?
Pam,United front...
Holly,"Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him."
Ryan,Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
Kelly,What are you referencing?
Ryan,Everything... Everything.
Holly,Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Jim,"Well, I mean he humped Michael."
Holly,"Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too."
Andy,"Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. This computer's a hunk of jjunk."
Erin,Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!
Andy,Where did you get this?!
Erin,Pam gave it to me!
Andy,"This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?"
Pam,You have a computer Andy.
Andy,"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So..."
Pam,"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one."
Andy,"Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but..."
Pam,"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy."
Stanley,So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Andy,"I'm not asking for one, I need it."
Phyllis,"If you're just handing them out, I want one too."
Andy,"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out."
Pam,"See, this is what I'm talking about."
Andy,What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Pam,Sorry Andy.
Todd,Hey what's going on you guys? Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
Kevin,Mean but good!
Holly,"So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter."
Todd,"I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom."
Holly,"Well, some girls go through a phase."
Kevin,"Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!"
Todd,Since when did you learn how to read?
Kevin,I do know how to read though!
Todd,Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Kevin,"He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight."
Dwight,"Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer."
Pam,What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
Andy,"It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched."
Pam,What? Erin is that true?
Erin,"I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one."
Pam,"Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away."
Andy,"Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-"
Pam,"I'm not freaking out, Andy."
Andy,#NAME?
Pam,"Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?"
Andy,That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Pam,Switch the computers back Andy.
Andy,Seriously?
Pam,Seriously.
Andy,Pam! Come on!
Pam,Now please.
Andy,Fine! Please make sure no one is humping me!
Erin,"Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. Thanks."
Michael,Best day ever. Best day ever!
Holly,So much happening.
Michael,"Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?"
Holly,No! No.
Michael,Please.
Holly,Did Todd tell you to do that?
Michael,"Yeah, You love him right? You love him. I can tell."
Holly,I love you.
Michael,"No. Not me, him."
Holly,That's certainly opinionated.
Erin,If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Holly,Oh I'm going.
Michael,"Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey..."
Holly,I don't think he's funnier than me.
Michael,He's funnier than me.
Holly,"No, he's not funny at all."
Michael,So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
Erin,Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Holly,"No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is."
Michael,Uhm...
Holly,Ok
Michael,That's insane!
Holly,"Honey, he's a jerk."
Erin,For Pete's sake it just needs to be done!
Todd,"So you two are married to each other now, right?"
Jim,Yeah.
Todd,That's sweet. How's the s*x?
Jim,
Dwight,"Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate."
Todd,Why?
Dwight,'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Jim,That's a lot of reasons!
Dwight,Drink it!
Todd,I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox.
Jim,Can I talk to you a second?
Jim,"So, this hot chocolate thing."
Dwight,None of your business.
Jim,"Well, you know you can't actually poison him."
Dwight,"It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this."
Jim,I really think we should join forces on this one.
Dwight,Really.
Jim,"What do we think, what would drive him crazy."
Dwight,I know.
Jim,Here we go.
Dwight,"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate."
Jim,"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them."
Dwight,Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Jim,"Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number."
Dwight,Who is Justice Beaver?
Jim,He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Dwight,Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Jim,"Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred."
Dwight,"Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over."
Andy,Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Pam,I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
Andy,Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Pam,You did that?
Andy,Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Pam,Okay. When did people sign-
Andy,"Mind if I close the door? What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool."
Pam,"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?"
Andy,You humiliated me in front of every body!
Pam,"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks."
Andy,"I mean, it's pretty broken already."
Pam,"Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one."
Andy,Pretty sneaky sis.
Ryan,"Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve."
Dwight,There are over four hundred of these!
Jim,Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Dwight,They're all good. So good! Number three
Jim,One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Dwight,"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going."
Andy,Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. Why are you doing this to me Andy? Because I hate your programs!
Todd,"And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that."
Michael,"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter."
Todd,Why?
Michael,"I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin."
Todd,Holly said that?
Michael,Yeah.
Holy,She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
Michael,I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
Todd,"She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer."
Michael,"You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls."
Todd,"Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers."
Michael,No it isn't.
Todd,You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Michael,"Yeah, a little bit."
Todd,Don't give up on me.
Michael,I won't.
Michael,"Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here."
Kevin,I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Michael,"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed."
Kevin,"That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it."
Michael,"Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines."
Todd,I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Kevin,"Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show."
Michael,"Kevin, do you accept the apology?"
Pam,"Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?"
Michael,This is where we first kissed.
Oscar,No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
Holly,I remember.
Pam,Oh.
Michael,And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves."
Holly,Michael..
Dwight,People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Michael,"Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes."
Jim,"Oh, yikes."
Holly,Yes.
Pam,It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
Michael,In-grown hair.
Dwight,It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Michael,"Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?"
Pam,The signs will drive people inside.
Holly,Mh hmm.
Dwight,The warmth will lure people inside.
Michael,We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Andy,Close it.
Holly,"Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!"
Dwight,This is how business...
Michael,"And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong."
Andy,Close it.
Michael,And over here..
Dwight,I'm not closing the door.
Holly,What happened here?
Andy,Close it.
Michael,"Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do."
Dwight,Stop it.
Holly,Nice
Andy,Just close it.
Michael,Let's go in here.
Dwight,"Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?"
Holly,Hi guys.
Meredith,Sure.
Michael,"This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives."
Dwight,Not so fast.
Jim,"Holly, will you marry me?"
Dwight,"Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here."
Holly,No.
Dwight,I will trade you for the used candle.
Stanley,Marry me Holly.
Meredith,Forget you.
Holly,No.
Dwight,"Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this."
Michael,That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
Meredith,"Fine, just give it."
Oscar,Will you marry me?
Dwight,That's how it's done.
Holly,No.
Kevin,"Woah, I love her. How much for that?"
Michael,That marriage would be a sham.
Michael,I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Gabe,Will you marry me?
Holly,10 dollars.
Holly,No.
Michael,"Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that."
Michael,Easy no.
Kevin,200
Angela,Will you marry me?
Michael,500
Holly,No.
Holly,20
Michael,That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Kevin,45
Ryan,Will you marry me Holly?
Michael,Get lost.
Holly,No.
Kevin,Damn it.
Michael,Only one that I was kind of worried about.
Michael,That is how you do it.
Michael,"This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?"
Holly,You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Holly,Your wife becoming me will I.
Michael,You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
Kevin,That's awesome!
Holly,Well we could put it in storage... in case.
Pam,Congratulations!
Michael,In case... in case of what?
Jim,Congratulations!
Holly,You know... in case if something changes.
Michael,"Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado."
Michael,I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Kevin,All of us?
Holly,Nope.
Michael,Yep.
Lady,How much for the slip and slide?
Jim,"Wait, what?"
Michael,Get lost.
Michael,Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
Michael,"Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you."
Kelly,Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Dwight,"Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies."
Kelly,Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Dwight,People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
Kelly,You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
Dwight,And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
Andy,"Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?"
Kevin,Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Andy,Really?
Kevin,Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Darryl,We should play it.
Andy,Well... there's no instructions.
Darryl,"It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out."
Kevin,Yea.
Andy,I'm pretty good at board games.
Darryl,"Well, shall we make it a little interesting?"
Andy,Sure.
Dwight,What is this?
Jim,How did those get out? I'm sorry.
Dwight,Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Jim,"I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known."
Dwight,That's a common swindlers trick.
Jim,"Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone."
Dwight,So you wanna sell me magic beans.
Jim,Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Dwight,Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
Holly,Michael called Dad?
Holly's Mom,"Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on?"
Holly,"Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?"
Holly's Dad,Holly?
Holly,Hi Dad.
Holly's Dad,There was a program on TV about India.
Holly,"Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?"
Holly's Dad,Wanna watch it?
Holly,"I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania."
Holly's Dad,What are you doing there?
Holly,"I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?"
Holly's Dad,"I'll, I'll put your mother on."
Holly,No. No... no Dad.
Holly's Mom,Holly?
Holly,"Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject."
Holly's Mom,"Don't you worry about him, he's got me."
Holly,Well who do you have?
Holly's Mom,I have your father. He's right here I'll put him on.
Holly,No. Mom?
Pam,"Oh, which one is decaf?"
Pam,Michael! Michael!
Michael,Hi.
Pam,Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Michael,"Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas."
Pam,Why do you need more gas?
Michael,"Well, I'm writing a message."
Pam,Is it a good message or a bad message?
Michael,I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Pam,Are you proposing!?
Michael,Maybe.
Pam,Wow.
Michael,Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Pam,Yea. Yea no problem.
Michael,Pam.
Pam,Yep.
Micahel,Could you light this please?
Pam,"Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible."
Michael,I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
Pam,This is terrible.
Michael,"No, this is romantic."
Pam,You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Ryan,Free sample?
Ryan,"My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted."
Dwight,You got this kosher certified?
Ryan,"No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good."
Dwight,"Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects."
Ryan,Thank you. Whatcha got there?
Dwight,"Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco."
Dwight,things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
Dwight,"Jim, put those away."
Jim,I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Dwight,"just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?"
Jim,"They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now."
Pam,Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
Michael,Why?
Pam,You called the meeting I don't..
Michael,I did?
Michael,Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
Pam,Michael.
Michael,Yes.
Pam,We are a family.
Michael,I could not have agreed with you more.
Pam,"And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way."
Michael,Yes. Thank you.
Pam,So about this proposal thing...
Michael,"No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it."
Pam,"Michael, she's perfect for you."
Oscar,She's the one.
Jim,She's amazing. This is very exciting.
Pam,So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Michael,I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Oscar,"Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself."
Andy,"Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card ."
Kevin,Nice.
Andy,And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
Kevin,No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Andy,Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
Darryl,And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Andy,Oooh.
Darryl,Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Kevin,no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Darryl,It was in the box.
Andy,Well played.
Darryl,Thank you.
Andy,We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
Kevin,No but that's not fair.
Andy,Well that's Dallas.
Darryl,Dallas indeed.
Oscar,"What... Ryan, where did you get this picture?"
Ryan,My mom also makes the best salsa.
Holly,This is your moms old stuff?
Phyllis,Yeah mostly.
Holly,How's she doing?
Phyllis,It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Holly,How do you know when its time?
Phyllis,Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Holly,Let me see.
Pam,Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
Ryan,Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Michael,"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'"
Jim,That's a guarantee.
Michael,"It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring."
Jim,Don't think you need the corpse then.
Michael,Heres the ring.
Pam,Holy s*** is that real?
Michael,Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
Oscar,No.
Michael,Is she not going to like that?
Pam,No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
Oscar,Where was that.
Jim,At a gas station.
Michael,At a gas station?
Jim,Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Michael,That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Pam,No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Michael,Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
Jim,Totally reasonable.
Michael,I just... it's terrifying.
Pam,She's not gonna say no.
Michael,I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Jim,Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Pam,You were scared?
Jim,Yeah... it.s scary.
Michael,Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
Holly,Look I need to talk to you.
Michael,"Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything."
Holly,I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Michael,Oh ok. For how long?
Holly,I don't know.
Michael,Is he alright?
Holly,Yeah.
Michael,You ok?
Holly,"Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad."
Michael,"Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that."
Holly,And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Michael,Ok.
Holly,And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
Michael,"No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope."
Holly,"Uh, what?"
Michael,No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
Kevin,Hey guys it's my turn.
Andy,"You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago."
Kevin,"Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people."
Darryl,"I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses."
Kevin,This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Darryl,Yeah where is it?
Kevin,Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Kevin,And that is Dallas.
Ryan,Nice.
Jim,Not bad right.
Ryan,Can't really tell the...
Jim,Nice.
Dwight,I know right... what the?
Jim,Oh my God.
Dwight,That... that's impossible.
Jim,"It is right. I mean, it's impossible."
Dwight,"All right, I'll take them."
Jim,They're probably worthless.
Dwight,Probably.
Jim,Leave the telescope.
Dwight,"I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope."
Michael,"Hey, how'd we do?"
Holly,13 dollars.
Michael,That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
Holly,Listen about earlier ...
Michael,"No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that."
Holly,It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Michael,Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
Michael,So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
Holly,Why?
Michael,This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
Michael,"Kahlua Sombrero, please."
Waiter,"All right, so just you tonight?"
Michael,"Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years."
Deangelo,I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.
Michael,"Oh, really?"
Deangelo,To begginings and endings.
Michael,"And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms."
Deangelo,The moms and the troops.
Michael,Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
Deangelo,I won't... I don't know her.
Michael,"I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado."
Deangelo,Colorado! The sunshine state.
Michael,Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
Deangelo,Doing some skiing?
Michael,"No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo."
Deangelo,Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
Michael,"You know, I would like to try the luge, through."
Deangelo,"Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess."
Michael,That's what I've heard.
Deangelo,I'm an olympics nut.
Michael,Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Deangelo/Michael,Summer!
Deangelo,"Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you..."
Deangelo,"You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going."
Michael,Really? What happened?
Deangelo,"You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?"
Michael,Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Deangelo,That's the way it goes.
Michael,"Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry."
Deangelo,Excuse me. Hello? You running late?
Michael,"No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar."
Deangelo,I'm at the bar too.
Michael,You are? What bar?
Deangelo,I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel.
Michael,I... do not see you.
Deangelo,How long have you...
Michael,"I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour."
Deangelo,"Ok, me too."
Deangelo/Michael,Sorry...
Michael,What're you wearing?
Deangelo,"I am wearing a grey suit, red tie."
Michael,Are we both at the right place?
Deangelo,Which place?
Michael,I hear your voice.
Deangelo,"I hear your voice, I see your lips moving."
Michael,"I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! Michael Scott."
Deangelo,Deangelo Vickers.
Michael,Wow... that is insane!
Deangelo,"That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend."
Michael,Here we go! Are you ready?
Deangelo,I am ready.
Michael,Alright! Here we go!
Michael,This is it. What do you think?
Deangelo,"Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine."
Deangelo,"I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune..."
Michael,
Deangelo,Did that? Did that just happen?! We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious!
Oscar,Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
Kevin,"Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart!"
Michael,"Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!"
Deangelo,
Michael,Come on out!
Deangelo,Hello! How are you sir?
Michael,"I am well, sir, how are you?"
Deangelo,"Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-"
Dwight,Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Kelly,I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Deangelo,I'll help you.
Kelly,"Oh, hi!"
Deangelo,Hello!
Kelly,Have we met before?
Deangelo,"No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before."
Kelly,"Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you."
Deangelo,
Kelly,And that is what you call a meet cute.
Michael,"And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!"
Darryl,Kind of embarassing.
Angela,"Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid."
Michael,"I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!"
Deangelo,"Oh. That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there!"
Michael,Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
Deangelo,
Andy,That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Deangelo,Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
Andy,"I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted."
Michael,"This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes."
Pam,"Well, it wasn't an affair."
Michael,Yes it was.
Pam,"But, no, but we are a family."
Jim,We made that.
Pam,Cecelia.
Deangelo,"Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own."
Pam,"Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four."
Pam,Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Jim,"Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies."
Dwight,Thanks for meeting me.
Michael,Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
Dwight,"There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here."
Michael,"You know me very well, Dwight."
Dwight,"That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy."
Michael,Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
Dwight,"I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me."
Meredith,That apple looks delic!
Deangelo,I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200.
Stanley,"Deangelo, you're going to starve to death."
Michael,So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
Darryl,It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
Darryl,"It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good."
Darryl,I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Deangelo,Here's the great thing about the southwest
Kevin,"Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them."
Angela,"Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?"
Deangelo,I did not.
Angela,"Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know."
Deangelo,"Sounds very interesting, thank you."
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you."
Deangelo,Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
Erin,"Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend."
Deangelo,Try it without using your name.
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!"
Deangelo,"Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?"
Erin,"Oh, assist."
Michael,I sorta like the old way.
Deangelo,I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.
Michael,"I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-"
Deangelo,And it really isn't.
Michael,Is that good?
Erin,"Yeah, ok, good."
Deangelo,"Well, I'd like to change it, actually."
Michael,"Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work."
Erin,What do you think?
Deangelo,I think a change would be nice.
Michael,You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
Denagelo,Change it.
Erin,...I'm so sorry. Sorry.
Deangelo,"Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you."
Andy,Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call...
Erin,"Deangelo, did you order a barber?"
Deangelo,"Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline."
Darryl,"Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?"
Andy,I... don't know. Help me.
Ryan,That is so badass. So hardcore.
Phyllis,"Yeah, real cool. Real power move."
Deangelo,I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
Michael,Shave me. This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
Deangelo,"Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close."
Michael,And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.
Deangelo,"Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?"
Michael,"It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice."
Oscar,You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
Deangelo,"Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups."
Michael,"Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-"
Deangelo,"Ok, then, powwows then, fine."
Michael,That's-
Pam,"Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable."
Jim,"Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'."
Pam,Da-das.
Jim,And what happens here is-
Deangelo,"You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry."
Jim,We were... I think she was just trying to-
Deangelo,"No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?"
Michael,"You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something."
Oscar,"Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent."
Michael,"Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about."
Erin,"Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips."
Michael,Don't shave my lips.
Deangelo,What's up?
Andy,"I don't mean to go into a rant here, but..."
Andy,"I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny."
Andy,"...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock."
Deangelo,"Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy."
Andy,I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where-
Deangelo,Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much?
Andy,"Yeah, right, I mean-"
Deangelo,Little click...
Erin,"Deangelo, this box came for you."
Deangelo,"Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this."
Stanley,Need a hand?
Deangelo,"Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!"
Michael,"You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-"
Ryan,
Michael,"I still have to look at this stuff, guys."
Darryl,"So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?"
Deangelo,"Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid."
Kevin,Interesting.
Michael,"Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy."
Darryl's sister,
Darryl,"Cool, cool. Alright, see you later."
Darryl's sister,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Darryl,"No, I'm good. Keep them."
Deangelo,"Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?"
Andy,Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here...
Deangelo,Drink some soap!
Andy,
Deangelo,
Andy,I guess this is my life now.
Dwight,How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Gabe,"First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here."
Dwight,I left a message at corporate.
Gabe,Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
Dwight,Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Gabe,What recommendation?
Dwight,From when he recommended me to replace him.
Gabe,"...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations."
Deangelo,Best whale watching
Michael,Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
Kevin,Awesome!
Phyllis,"Mmm, whatcha got?"
Michael,"PB and J, my mom's recipe!"
Angela,Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Deangelo,I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
Stanley,What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Michael,"I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!"
Oscar,"Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?"
Michael,What?
Deangelo,"Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot."
Jim,"Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?"
Deangelo,"No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable."
Michael,"Oscar, here you go."
Deangelo,You're getting nut particles all in the air!
Michael,No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Deangelo,"Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now."
Michael,"No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. No body go in there. Stay where you are."
Oscar,"Michael, This is insane."
Michael,"No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No."
Jim,"Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this."
Michael,"Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight."
Dwight,"Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room."
Deangelo,"Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?"
Michael,"I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine."
Deangelo,"Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. Bring it in, come on. Ok."
Michael,Ok. Why did you have to be so damn good?
Deangelo,I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.
Michael,"No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it."
Deangelo,"Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time!"
Micahel,Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working.
Deangelo,Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?
Michael,You'll figure it out.
Jim,"Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?"
Deangelo,That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
Jim,Thank you very much.
Pam,"See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand."
Jim,We're back in! Right?
Deangelo,"I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About.'"
Michael,It is six a.m. and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
Women,E-Mail forms you made us read.
DeAngelo,"Yes, and this happens every...?"
All,"Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!"
Michael,"Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend."
Meredith,You hit me with your car!
DeAngelo,"Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition."
Ryan,You helped me get off drugs!
Michael,Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
Creed,I watch you when you sleep.
Michael,"Alright let's go! This way, this way!"
Oscar,I forgive you for kissing me!
DeAngelo,Thanks.
All,"Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call."
Michael,Surprise!
Kelly and Erin,"Call, text or e-mail, or call."
DeAngelo,Congratulations!
DeAngelo,Measure your life in love!
Jim,"Yep, okay..."
All,"Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call."
Michael,You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Michael,"Yeah, okay. Well this is gonna hurt like a mother."
Jim,Okay.
DeAngelo,"Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!"
Michael,Here we go! Have Pam come down.
Michael,No it's not.
Jim,No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Oscar,It's his last Dundies.
Pam,What's going on?
Jim,You gotta play along man.
Jim,Stay in bed!
Oscar,Come on Toby.
Michael,Congratulations!
Michael,Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
Stanley,Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Toby,"I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more."
Michael,We got it.
DeAngelo,"Uh, leave it at the door or...?"
Michael,Yeah that's fine.
Michael,Hey Toby! You suck!
DeAngelo,Is this an employee of ours?
Michael,Go go go go go go!
Michael,I've never seen this place in the daylight.
DeAngelo,It reminds me of Katrina.
Michael,"Here we go, alright got it? Set? Hello?"
Meredith,I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
DeAngelo,Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
Meredith,"Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!"
Michael,Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Meredith,No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. Let me fix you breakfast!
DeAngelo,I'm not going in there.
Michael,Go.
Michael,Good morning Erin.
Erin,"Oh hey, didn't see you."
Michael,You have big plans for tonight?
Erin,"I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!!"
Michael,You are getting so funny! Very good.
Michael,"The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on."
Michael,Anything can happen at the Dundies! They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Dwight,"Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair."
Michael,Black tie optional.
Dwight,Every day is black tie optional!
Michael,"A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!"
Kevin,Nice!
Phyllis,I love their breadsticks!
Pam,"Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!"
Ryan,I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Pam,"Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?"
Ryan,"I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking."
Pam,"You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad."
Michael,"Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?"
Ryan,Yeah that's great.
Michael,"So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is DeAngelo!"
Dwight,"Always the padawan, never the Jedi."
DeAngelo,"Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass."
Michael,Think of it as part of your training.
DeAngelo,"Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay..."
Michael,"Okay, well we'll work on it."
DeAngelo,"Michael, I'm very, very bad."
Michael,You are doing it.
Michael,Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Kevin,Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Michael,"Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning."
DeAngelo,"That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-"
Michael,"Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys..."
DeAngelo,This did not happen.
Michael,Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. Ryan how are you today?
Ryan,"Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough."
Michael,There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
DeAngelo,"Uhhh, you sir! Are we having fun tonight?"
Jim,Having a great time.
DeAngelo,Oh good!
Jim,"Thanks, yeah."
DeAngelo,Where were you on September 11th?
Michael,No! God!
DeAngelo,"This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously."
Andy,Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
Michael,"No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!"
Jim,"Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting."
Michael,"Jim, please no loopholes."
Darryl,"Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?"
Michael,"This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?"
DeAngelo,Me mo. Me mo.
Michael,Good. Good. Good!
DeAngelo,"Meee Mo, Mee!"
Michael,"Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood."
DeAngelo,"When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them."
Michael,"Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. Let's try this. Put these on. I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, and make it sound perfect."
DeAngelo,"THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!"
Michael,Say it with an accent!
DeAngelo,THE DUNDIES!
Michael,The Dundies!
DeAngelo,THE DUNDIES!
Jim,"I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries."
Pam,"Yeah... Hey, Erin, everything okay?"
Erin,"Get away from the car, he's gonna see you."
Jim,Who's gonna see us?
Erin,Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Jim,Get in the car?
Erin,Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry sorry sorry.
Pam,What's wrong?
Erin,I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Pam,Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Erin,"I, really don't like spending time with him."
Pam,"Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?"
Jim,I think I'm gonna go.
Pam,What?
Jim,I think you got this. Kay? Alright. Feel better!
Erin,Thank you Jim.
Jim,"I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me."
Erin,"I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean."
Pam,"Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him."
Dwight,
Kevin,Hi!
Dwight,Appalling. Eye sore. Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Erin,"DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you."
DeAngelo,Hello?
"""Jo""",DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!
DeAngelo,Oh no!
"""Jo""",Luckily I have someone for you!
DeAngelo,Billy Crystal?
"""Jo""",Better.
DeAngelo,Neil Patrick Harris?
"""Jo""",He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi!
DeAngelo,"Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, Get Him to the Dundies!"
DeAngelo,"Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?"
"""Angela""","My boyfriend can, he's a state senator."
Audience,
DeAngelo,Mmhmm.
Angela,"Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!"
Oscar,
Oscar,"Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help."
DeAngelo,Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
"""Jim""","I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?"
Jim,
DeAngelo,No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!
"""Phyllis""","Well, what are you talking about? Ohh! Ohh! I've fallen and I can't get up!"
DeAngelo,"Maybe I just need to look into my heart. DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott."
Michael,I'm here. In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
Oscar,"The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content."
Dwight,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! Was that part of the...?"
Michael,"DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!"
DeAngelo,"Go do it by yourself, get Ryan."
Michael,"No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!"
DeAngelo,"This was not, part of the job description!"
Michael,"Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!"
DeAngelo,Who am I doing this for?
Michael,"You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering"
DeAngelo,I can't.
Michael,Say it.
DeAngelo,"Stop, hitting me."
Michael,"You can do it, just say it."
DeAngelo,Hit me again.
Michael,"Now hit me. One, two, three."
Together,It's showtime.
Michael,"Alright, here we go."
Michael,Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line.
DeAngelo,Fall asleep right after s*x. Huh guys?
Jim,"Nope, go back to the script."
Michael,"There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!"
Jim,"Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?"
Michael,Well done.
Jim,"I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!"
Michael ,Alright.
Pam,You didn't think to mention me huh?
Jim,Didn't I?
Michael,"Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!"
Meredith,"Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!"
Dwight,"Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?"
Jim,I gotta go do this.
Pam,Why?
Dwight,Big smiles folks! There they are.
Michael,"Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, Danny Cordray! Danny couldn't be here tonight..."
Ryan,"How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective."
Michael,"Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! Come on up here you sick b*st*rd."
Phyllis,I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
DeAngelo,"They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. No, I hate this, I hate it so much. Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. This is for you trashcan!"
Manager,Who gave you those crayons?
Kevin,I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Manager,This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it!
Kevin,Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Michael,"You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!"
Meredith,That is bull!
Erin,"Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up."
Gabe,What?
Erin,"I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? Thank you for hearing me."
Gabe,"Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. Alright I'm gonna go."
Michael,There you go.
Darryl,Damn that was cold.
Michael,"It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers."
Audience,Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
DeAngelo,"Hold on, hold on one second. I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!"
Manager,"Okay, okay."
DeAngelo,THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
Michael,"DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo."
DeAngelo,"This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!"
Michael,"Okay, we're done! That's it."
DeAngelo,"Michael, are we?!"
Michael,We're done. We're done!
Michael,"So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well..."
Pam,"Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!"
Michael,What?
DeAngelo,I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
Michael,"No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time."
Pam,"Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started."
Michael,"So what you're saying is you kinda like it? I've fallen and I can't get up! That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good."
Jim,"I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-"
Michael,That got a big laugh.
Jim,That did. Pretty huge laugh.
Michael,You were laughing right?
Stanley,I was.
DeAngelo,"You know what, I have to go to the bathroom."
Michael,We're really close.
DeAngelo,I can just run over to the gas station.
Dwight,We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Michael,"That's true, we wouldn't get seats together."
DeAngelo,"Okay, fine I'll hold it."
Michael,"You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well."
Dwight,I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Michael,Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Dwight,"Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!"
DeAngelo,"Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby."
Michael,What is your problem?!
Dwight,"I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring."
Michael,"Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful."
Dwight,"And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!"
DeAngelo,"Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here."
Michael,He is in an all-out sprint.
Michael,"Here... Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard!"
Andy,"A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael."
Michael,"Oh, okay."
Andy,"I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything."
Darryl,
Michael,"Oh my God, something's happening."
Andy,"Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math."
All,"Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here."
Pam,In costumes!
Jim,And impressions!
Toby,In meetings.
Erin and Kelly,And cups of coffee.
Kevin,For birthdays!
Stanley,More meetings and-
Michael,"Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude."
Michael,Ahhhh...
Dwight,Michael?
Erin,"I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose."
Michael,Yes?
Michael,Maybe neither.
Dwight,I've got a treat for you!
Erin,I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Michael,"Ahh, thank you. Like a butler."
Michael,"Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime."
Dwight,"Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters."
Erin,Extension 147.
Michael,"Oh, these do not taste like oysters."
Michael,N-
Dwight,"That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Hah!"
Erin,I know.
Michael,Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
Michael,Okay.
Dwight,What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Phyllis,You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Michael,"I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies."
Michael,"Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?"
Dwight,Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Phyllis,No. I'm on a sale!
Michael,"Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket..."
Michael,"Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind."
Dwight,Great idea.
Phyllis,Okay...
Michael,...in order to feed the bears.
Michael,"Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow."
Dwight,Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Dwight,Yes.
Michael,How do you mean?
Michael,So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation.
Dwight,"Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? You're like a giant walking salami!"
Dwight,"This is gonna be good. To whom it may concern. Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. The dictionary defines superlative as"
Michael,"Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?"
Dwight,
Dwight,Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Michael,
Michael,Okay.
DeAngelo,"I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. But I can say this"
DeAngelo,You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
Jim,"Ahh, what happened to you?"
Michael,Hm?
Michael,You should see the other guy.
DeAngelo,"I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on."
Dwight,
Michael,Well I have interviews.
Michael,Jim where is Pam?
DeAngelo,"That's nice. How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. You okay?"
Jim,"Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders."
Michael,"Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure."
Michael,But it is already three o'clock!
DeAngelo,"You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair."
Pam,
Michael,"Oh you don't, that's-"
Michael,"Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay."
DeAngelo,I will be in the break room.
Michael,Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
Michael,That sounds good. Thank you.
Michael,"And you, why are you still here."
DeAngelo,Dead man walking.
Gabe,"I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed."
Michael,"Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck."
Michael,"No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite."
Gabe,Stay away from Erin!
DeAngelo,That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Andy,Hey!
Andy,"Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car."
Gabe,I'm your boss!
DeAngelo,Okay whatever.
Andy,"Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?"
Andy,"Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call."
Gabe,"No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!"
Client,Keep talking.
Andy,Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
DeAngelo,"Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. You'll never guess, we did it!"
Gabe,No! You go away!
Andy,Hey! Good job boss!
Andy,Hi Tuna.
DeAngelo,We did it!
Jim,So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Michael,"Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this!"
Phyllis,How about cupcakes?
Stanley,"Yes, what is this about?"
Angela,Please.
Michael,What is this meeting about?
Pam,What's wrong with cupcakes?
Stanley,Mmhmmm.
Angela,Everything.
Michael,"Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four."
Michael,There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Phyllis,They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Pam,Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
Michael,Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Pam,We thought.
Stanley,Is that it?
Angela,It's an experiment.
Michael,"Umm, hmm?"
Phyllis,The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Stanley,Is that it?
Pam,So this is the dream team.
Michael,"Ummm... Hm... No. No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!"
Meredith,Hey! What are you saying?!
Jim,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Angela,The dream team... and Meredith.
Michael,Sure. Be right out!
Meredith,"We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite."
Jim,"So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day."
Michael,Mmm!
Michael,Ohh...
Phyllis,Yeah that was a surprise...
Jim,"What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?"
Michael,"You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla."
Michael,Okay...
Pam,Okay.
Jim,You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Michael,"Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?"
Michael,Maybe.
Pam,Should we get toppings?
Jim,"Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good."
Michael,What do you like Pam?
Michael,Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
Pam,What?
Jim,Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Michael,What kind of toppings would you like?
Michael,"T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. You started with this company, as a fine young man..."
Pam,Hot fudge?
Jim,You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Michael,Sounds good. Fudge it up!
Michael,"Oh, okay."
Michael,"I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. I still need something to drink out of though."
Jim,"And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had."
Michael,"Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis."
Michael,Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Phyllis,Please Michael.
Jim,Alright.
Michael,"When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. And she still is."
Michael,Alright.
Phyllis,I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Jim,"Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but..."
Phyllis,"Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold."
Michael,"I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?"
Michael,Ahh.
Jim,"I will see you, tomorrow at lunch."
Phyllis,"It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool."
Michael,I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Michael,"Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind."
Jim,You got it.
Phyllis,It's cute.
Michael,Okay... Phyllis.
Michael,"Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. May you never lose the fun loving quality in life."
Phyllis,"Oh no, they're still not done."
Stanley,"Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls."
Michael,"No no no, let me see. Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em."
Michael,"Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts."
Creed,See ya tomorrow boss!
Andy,Wow.
Michael,Later guys.
Stanley,Yeah wow!
Michael,"Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?"
Andy,You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
Michael,"Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. That's what she said!"
Michael,"But you're the best salesman, on the inside."
Pam,"No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly."
Phyllis,What does that even mean?
DeAngelo,"Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. I for one love the corners. Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. What am I doing? Come on DeAngelo!"
Michael,"You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted."
Dwight,Uh oh...
Andy,I'm gonna lose 'em.
Michael,You're not gonna lose them.
Andy,I promise you that I will.
Michael,Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Stanley,Gimme those clients!
Andy,No.
Phyllis,Do you believe that?!
Dwight,I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
DeAngelo,"I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it."
Michael,"Kevin, I have something for you."
Kevin,Oh!
Michael,You know who that is?
Kevin,Oh...
Michael,"Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?"
Kevin,Better...
Michael,"Good, stand up. You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore."
Kevin,But...
Michael,You will find love.
Kevin,"Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now."
Michael,"Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-"
Andy,"I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!"
Michael,"Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this."
Oscar,Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
Michael,"It looks like a It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!"
Michael,"Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have s*x at some point?"
Angela,It was just you...
Michael,"How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator."
Oscar,State Senator.
Michael,"Mmhmm, bravo!"
Oscar,Brava!
Angela,You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Michael,Sure!
Angela,"Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading."
Michael,Who's that? Who's that guy?
Angela,"Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide."
Michael,"I guess this could be the one, huh?"
Angela,Yeah.
Andy,Hey.
DeAngelo,Hey!
Andy,I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
DeAngelo,Let's rip it up homes.
Gabe,Walk away bitch.
Oscar,Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Michael,My last pay check?
Oscar,You have an address yet in Colorado?
Michael,No.
Oscar,What town do Holly's parents live in?
Michael,"I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?"
Kevin,Sounds beautiful!
Pam,You should do more stuff like that.
Kevin,I'm going to!
Jim,"Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us."
Michael,"Nah, I'm almost done."
Jim,You sure?
Michael,Yeah.
Pam,So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Kevin,Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Pam,"It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking."
Kevin,"Yeah, it won't shred magazines."
Pam,It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Kevin,I know...
Jim,Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Kevin,"No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines."
Pam,I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Michael,"I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come."
Holly,Hello there!
Michael,Hi. What is the name of our town?
Holly,Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
Michael,"No, no. I just needed to hear your voice."
Holly,Oh you mean this?
Michael,Yes. Yes my hero!
Holly,"I'll pay the rent! Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!"
Michael,"Ohh, I miss you."
Holly,Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Michael,Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Holly,I love you too.
Michael,"Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. And I have said goodbye to half of them."
Toby,"Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up."
Michael,Okay.
Toby,Okay.
Michael,Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
Kelly,What?!
Michael,"If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?"
Kelly,Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Michael,"She was once my girl, and she is your girl now."
Ryan,Wow.
Michael,Yeah.
Ryan,This is... totally unnecessary.
Michael,You're not prone to seizures?
Ryan,No.
Pam,So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
Meredith,Erotic.
Angela,See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Phyllis,"Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes."
Meredith,I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Angela,Good God...
Meredith,"They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!"
Pam,"I don't, I don't think we sh-"
Meredith,"I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing."
Pam,"Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue."
Phyllis,"As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one."
Pam,"You know what, I think we should get some other input."
Kelly,I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Phyllis,"Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said."
Angela,"No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker."
Michael,"Um, Pam."
Pam,"Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later."
Michael,Okay...
Erin,Gabe!
Gabe,I need to talk to you!
Erin,You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
abe,"Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes."
Erin,Hey Creed.
Creed,Not cool man.
Erin,I really think you should leave.
Gabe,"Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room."
Erin,"Can we talk about this later, I have to go."
Gabe,"Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one."
Erin,Gabe!
Gabe,Okay...
Toby,"Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way."
Rory,I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.
Toby,Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Rory,Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
Toby,"Well, no. He hates jams."
Michael,Darryl!
Darryl,Hey.
Michael,"I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you."
Darryl,"That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum."
Michael,"Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer."
Darryl,No. Can't let you do that Mike.
Michael,No problem. Worth a try.
Michael,Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
Warehouse Guy,No.
Michael,"Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip."
DeAngelo,"okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? Hmm?"
Andy,I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
DeAngelo,That's stupid.
Andy,What do I know?
DeAngelo,What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
Andy,Yeah.
DeAngelo,Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
Andy,Yeah!
DeAngelo,'Cause if you do now's the time.
Andy,Alright.
DeAngelo,Not while I'm driving.
Michael,"Catch you guys- Catch you guys on the filippity flip. Flippity flip! Flippity flip! Really? Okay, see ya guys!"
DeAngelo,You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
Andy,No. I don't.
DeAngelo,"I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me."
Andy,"Awwhh, wow."
DeAngelo,Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! Yeah! Again.
Andy,"Oh, okay..."
DeAngelo,Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! You hear me?! You feel that energy?
Andy,Mmhmmm.
DeAgnelo,"Wooo! Yeah! Okay, again."
Erin,"I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else."
Michael,Kevin?
Erin,Andy.
Deangelo,"So, coasting time is officially over. Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast. If you don't like 'em, this is called a door. You can walk right through it. Alright. I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5. Change number one"
Deangelo,"Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house."
Darryl,Seriously?
Jordan,"I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry."
Deangelo,Stone cold seriously.
Deangelo,"Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it."
Deangelo,"They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care."
Kevin,Yes! Okay.
Deangelo,"Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair."
Deangelo,Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela?
Toby,Thanks.
Angela,No.
Deangelo,"Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it."
Deangelo,Oscar?
Oscar,"These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?"
Oscar,No thank you.
Deangelo,"I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't. That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions?"
Deangelo,"Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible."
Kevin,This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.
Jim,Fantastic.
Deangelo,"That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin."
Deangelo,Alright?
Deangelo,Kev's got me pegged.
Jim,Yup.
Deangelo,It blows away Vermont in the fall.
Deangelo,This is also for the troops. Doctor is in! Ahhhh!
Darryl,"Snap, for real?"
Jim,Now what?
Pam,"Good morning, Deangelo."
Erin,Deangelo?
Deangelo,Hold on.
Deangelo,Tablab.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,"Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?"
Deangelo,"And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring."
Erin,Who should I say is calling?
Pam,Because of the flowers.
Jim,Erin.
Deangelo,No. Because the entire state smells like Earth.
Deangelo,says to bartender Droswip. Droswip.
Pam,"Dogwoods, or just the Earth."
Gabe,"Droswip, yeah. I get it. Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom."
Deangelo,"Yes, Pam."
Pam,"Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume."
Deangelo,Put it with the rest.
Pam,Okay.
Deangelo,Hey dudes!
Jim,Hey!
Andy,Hey!
Pam,"Oh my God, he hates me!"
Jim,No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Pam,I know.
Jim,"Every time there's a silence, your brain's like ""Heh-heh-huh-huh""."
Pam,Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Jim,Careful. There is no inner circle.
Andy,"Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah."
Jim,"There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys."
Kevin,"Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle! Which doesn't exist."
Deangelo,There he is! Got ya coffee.
Dwight,"Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you."
Deangelo,"Not a coffee guy, I take it."
Dwight,"It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun."
Deangelo,"Listen. I've got a sixer. ""Automatic for the People"" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want."
Dwight,I think you'll find what you're looking for over there.
Deangelo,"No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight."
Deangelo,"Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say?"
Kevin,Yes!
Deangelo,"Right! Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients."
Kevin,"Yeah, I say we just go for it!"
Deangelo,Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff?
Jim,"That's Toys R Us, I think."
Deangelo,"No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that. What do you think?"
Gabe,"Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time."
Deangelo,Deangelo! See what I did there? That's what you need to do. It's that little English. The British are coming.
Kevin,Yes.
Deangelo,Deangelo's open!
Deangelo,"Hey Ry. Your department's killing it, baby."
Ryan,"Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure."
Deangelo,Keep it up.
Ryan,"The problem with having ""It"" or ""the X-factor"" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say."
Kelly,What?
Ryan,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Kelly,Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Ryan,"Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you."
Kelly,"Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie."
Ryan,I'd die for you too.
Kelly,You really would?
Ryan,"Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!"
Kelly,"Sure thing, Mr. Howard."
Deangelo,Woo. Glad he's not my boss.
Ryan,You're the best. Thank you.
Deangelo,You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.
Dwight,Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
Deangelo,"You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?"
Dwight,"I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?"
Deangelo,Ohhhh no.
Dwight,What?
Deangelo,Okay? I'm gonna win you over.
Dwight,No you're not.
Deangelo,Yes I am.
Dwight,No.
Deangelo,Oh yes.
Dwight,No.
Deangelo,Yes.
Dwight,No.
Deangelo,Yes.
Dwight,No.
Deangelo,Yes.
Dwight,No.
Deangelo,Yes.
Dwight,No.
Deangelo,Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
Jim,"Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled ""administrative"" and ""assistant."""
Darryl,The winner
Deangelo,"What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine."
Jim,Seriously?
Deangelo,"Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320?"
Gabe,320. Just freeballin' it.
Deangelo,"It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo?"
Kevin,"Oh, I think it's 18 hundo."
Gabe,Give or take.
Deangelo,Sorry gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car. It's not.
Pam,"Oh no, do you think it was stolen?"
Andy,"I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. Got some extra balls! Hey-hey-hey-ho!"
Deangelo,"Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? Prepare... to go into the danger zone."
Pam,"Oh wow, you weren't kidding."
Deangelo,"No. Never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare! Incoming! And we're on! Remember, nothing's impossible! Phyllis, where's Phyllis?"
Phyllis,Here.
Deangelo,"Do you believe in me, Phyllis?"
Phyllis,Yeah.
Deangelo,Because I believe in you.
Phyllis,Okay.
Deangelo,"Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis! That took a lot of guts! Ho! I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something."
Kevin,Didn't drop a single ball!
Pam,Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.
Jim,What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Pam,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?
Jim,He's good at his job. And I like working for him.
Angela,"Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist."
Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the ""v*g1n* Monologues"" called the ""pen1s Apologies."" So I know a thing or two."
Angela,"Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?"
Andy,How could I not see it? You're so right.
Pam,Why don't you talk to him about it?
Jim,"And say what? ""Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"""
Pam,Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Jim,Mmm-hmm.
Andy,"And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his pen1s goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls?"
Jim,"Hey, you got a second?"
Deangelo,"Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke."
Deangelo,So what's up?
Jim,"Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --"
Darryl,"Hey, saw Jim come in. We meeting?"
Deangelo,Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting.
Jim,"If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --"
Deangelo,"What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys!"
Jim,"I know. Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads."
Deangelo,Uh-oh. Right?
Kevin,Hot!
Jim,"Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --"
Darryl,Damn!
Jim,Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
Deangelo,Are you serious? Who feels this way?
Jim,Oh. Like nobody.
Gabe,"Umm, Pam?"
Jim,It was --
Gabe,Was it Pam?
Kevin,"That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. Kevin..."
Deangelo,"Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea."
Jim,That's awesome.
Deangelo,Thank you.
Kelly,"Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again."
Ryan,So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Kelly,When Deangelo's around.
Ryan,And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
Kelly,All the time.
Ryan,All the time.
Deangelo,"Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?"
Erin,Absolutely.
Jim,"Hey, who'd you end up hiring?"
Deangelo,"Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not. I am not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a v*g1n*. Raise your hand if someone you love has a v*g1n*. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just about everyone. What about Deangelo's hand? Oh wow. He's got 'em both up. Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens."
Phyllis,"I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't."
Deangelo,"Dwight, what's your take?"
Dwight,"What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all."
Deangelo,"Man, you're smart. Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield. This is everyone."
Jordan,Hello.
Pam,"So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?"
Jordan,"No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame."
Kelly,Lame? You worked at Anthropology?
Jordan,Yeah.
Kelly,That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job?
Jordan,"Well, I umm -"
Kelly,You chose this job over that job?
Ryan,"Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today."
Pam,"So, umm, is this your first office job then?"
Jordan,Yeah.
Deangelo,Yup.
Pam,Wow.
Deangelo,No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.
Kevin,"Jim, you coming?"
Jim,"Oh yeah, did he text us?"
Kevin,Yeah.
Dwight,No!
Pam,"Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us."
Jim,He didn't text me.
Andy,Yes! I'm in.
Angela,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Andy,"I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within. What's up, mancave!"
Pam,"Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you."
Deangelo,"Internally, for office use where do we get our paper from? Do we go -"
Jim,"Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest."
Deangelo,Hey Jim.
Jim,Yeah.
Deangelo,Can I help you?
Jim,Nope. Just... Okay.
Dwight,"So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?"
Jim,"Well, there is no inner...circle."
Jordan,Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
Dwight,Really? Anything.
Jordan,Do you need anything?
Dwight,"Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone."
Andy,"Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --"
Jim,So this is my life. Until I win the lottery. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Pam,"So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer."
Ryan,"Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all."
Deangelo,No one likes a money grubber.
Kelly,"I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years."
Deangelo,Ohh.
Ryan,"Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly."
Kelly,"No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding."
Deangelo,"Is this true, Ryan?"
Ryan,I did not see Rango.
Deangelo,"Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said."
Kelly,He's not saying anything!
Deangelo,It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way.
Kelly,"That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti--"
Ryan,"Oh, close call! Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am."
Pam,"Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?"
Gabe,"Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself."
Deangelo,"Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?"
Gabe,Total brain burp.
Deangelo,I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line.
Kevin,Whoa.
Darryl,Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha!
Darryl,"The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese."
Pam,"Okay, well it's just really loud."
Deangelo,"Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game."
Darryl,Do it!
Deangelo,Jim! Come on in.
Pam,You're back in.
Jim,"You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours."
Deangelo,"Yeah, we'll set that up one day."
Jim,"Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it."
Deangelo,"Yeah, I don't know."
Jim,Why not?
Deangelo,Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.
Dwight,"Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop."
Deangelo,"Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper!"
Dwight,"Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership."
Jim,"Alright, there you go."
Deangelo,"Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?"
Jim,"15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?"
Deangelo,"Nah, that's 15. Yeah."
Jim,Okay.
Deangelo,"And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?"
Jordan,Seriously?
Pam,We could get Deangelo flowers.
Kevin,Another one?
Dwight,"No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up."
Darryl and Angela,Yes!
Phyllis,That's true.
Angela,"Seven, two..."
Jim,"All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?"
Oscar,Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Dwight,"Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?"
Angela,"Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight..."
Jim,Nope. Baskets have it.
Darryl,Nine first.
Jim,"So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high."
Angela,"Nine, eight, five..."
Jim,"Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy."
Kevin,Thank you.
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan, gather my things from my desk."
Angela,"Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six..."
Jim,Wait...
Kevin,Nice.
Pam,What have you done?
Angela,"Two, one..."
Dwight [on phone],Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
Kevin,"Oh, I hit three. I hit three."
Mose [on phone],Aaaaahhhhh!
Angela,God!
Pam,Can't stay there all day.
Jim,I'm coming.
Pam,Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Jim,You'd slow me down.
Jim,"Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10"
Pam,Stop stalling! Come on.
All,"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation..."
All but Oscar,...under God...
All,"...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
Angela,Amen.
Dwight,"Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself."
Erin,"Ooh, about what?"
Dwight,That's on a need-to-know basis.
Erin,I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Dwight,"General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection."
Jim,"Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?"
Dwight,Define foment.
Jim,You define foment.
Dwight,Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Dwight,Aha!
Kelly,"Oh my God, what is wrong with you?"
Dwight,Gotcha! Why are you late?
Kelly,"It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal."
Dwight,All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
Andy,"In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so..."
Erin,Oh! Darryl's funny.
Andy,"I know, right?"
Gabe,"Hey, Andy?"
Andy,Yeah?
Gabe,Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Andy,Sure. What's going on?
Gabe,Are you still in love with Erin?
Andy,What?
Gabe,"Because I am. I need to get her back. I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?"
Andy,"No, this is horrifying."
Gabe,"No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?"
Andy,"We're just friends, okay?"
Gabe,Do you promise that?
Andy,"Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?"
Gabe,"No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying."
Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?"
Jim,"Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know."
Dwight,You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Jim,"Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion."
Dwight,"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist."
Jim,"And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it."
Kevin,One...
Stanley,
Andy,"Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in."
Dwight,I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Kevin,No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Creed,He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Pam,You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Creed,No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
Phyllis,He means the ice pack.
Erin,2
Gabe,I'm sorry. This can't wait.
Erin,He's just gonna call back.
Gabe,"Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God."
Erin,What?
Gabe,"Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?"
Erin,Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Gabe,Well... it's just... it messes up my rhythm.
Erin,"I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him."
Jim,"Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic."
Dwight,"Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue."
Jim,And the desk.
Dwight,"The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business."
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Jim,"I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so..."
Dwight,Don't make me fire you.
Jim,You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Dwight,Don't make me pre-fire you.
Jim,You wouldn't dare.
Dwight,"Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired."
Jim,"If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then."
Dwight,What?
Jim,"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, ""Well that's pretty premature to think,"" but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared."
Dwight,"How you doing, Jordan?"
Jordan,I'm good.
Dwight,"Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly."
Jordan,Why are you telling me this?
Dwight,"Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster."
Dwight,"Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. Ohh... Oh, what a day. What a day."
Pam,"Dwight, are you carrying a gun?"
Dwight,"The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me."
Andy,"Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable."
Dwight,"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster."
Pam,Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight,Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Angela,Thank you.
Phyllis,You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Dwight,Uh... hello!
Kevin,You could put a banana in it.
Dwight,Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Kevin,"In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later."
Pam,"Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo."
Dwight,Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah!
Erin,Andy!
Andy,Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
Oscar,My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Andy,Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Meredith,"Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-"
Toby,"Hey, what happened?"
Kelly,"Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head."
Dwight,"No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun."
Andy,Something's definitely wrong.
Oscar,I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Angela,"Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD."
Oscar,Firewall.
Gabe,I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Dwight,"Okay, why are you calling Jo?"
Andy,I think I should go the hospital.
Erin,I'll go with you.
Gabe,No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Darryl,I'll take him.
Andy,"Thank you, Darryl."
Darryl,What's wrong with you?
Andy,It's my ear.
Darryl,Yeah.
Andy,"Okay, sorry."
Toby,"Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before."
Gabe,I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Dwight,"Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!"
Dwight,"Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation."
Stanley,We all saw you do it.
Dwight,Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Erin,Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Dwight,I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Toby,I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?
Dwight,"Okay, really?"
Toby,Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
Ryan,I felt terrorized.
Dwight,Come on.
Toby,"Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that."
Dwight,"I just really, really think we should handle this internally."
Ryan,"Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?"
Dwight,"Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best."
Andy,Hey. We're back.
Dwight,"There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories."
Andy,"Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal."
Dwight,Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Andy,Yeah.
Phyllis,How's your hearing?
Andy,Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
Darryl,"I was talking like this. I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me."
Kelly,"Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition."
Dwight,American Idol? What? No.
Kelly,Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Dwight,No.
Kelly,Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Dwight,"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition."
Phyllis,"Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day."
Angela,Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Kevin,Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Dwight,I put everything back in the vending machine.
Kevin,Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
Pam,You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Dwight,Okay.
Jim,"Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good."
Dwight,Thank God.
Jim,"Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in ""Shagadelic, baby,"" at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?"
Dwight,What's jazz hands?
Jim,
Dwight,Fine.
Dwight,
Kevin,"What the is that? Oh, my..."
Jo,"Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers."
Dwight,"Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?"
Jo,Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Jim,"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?"
Jo,"Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic."
Dwight,"Well, what can you do? Life."
Andy,We have to clean this up now!
Erin,She had so much -
Gabe,"Hey, guys."
Erin,Hey.
Gabe,Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Andy,No!
Gabe,"Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?"
Andy,Uh...
Gabe,I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Andy,"Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying..."
Gabe,"No, I was not."
Andy,And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Dwight,"Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?"
Kevin,"Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage."
Dwight,"No, Kevin, come on."
Kevin,"My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it."
Dwight,"Kevin, not now."
Kevin,"Hey, Jo!"
Dwight,"Okay, okay. Shh!"
Kevin,"No, under the jacket."
Dwight,"You're kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist."
Kevin,I don't feel anything.
Dwight,"Oh, it's so wet."
Kevin,"Push harder, Dwight."
Dwight,I can't. I can't push harder!
Kevin,"Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher."
Dwight,"Okay, how's that?"
Kevin,Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Dwight,I'm kneading it!
Kevin,Don't eat it.
Jo,"Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?"
Dwight,Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Jo,What?!
Dwight,"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -"
Jo,Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
Dwight,"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps."
Jo,Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Dwight,I take full responsibility.
Jo,Who else would be responsible?
Dwight,Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Pam,You shot a gun off -
Dwight,Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Jo,"Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius."
Dwight,Got it.
Jo,"I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job."
Dwight,"Jo, please... I will -"
Jo,"No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement."
Jo,You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Gabe,Yep.
Jim,Yep.
Jo,"Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?"
Toby,"Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority."
Jo,Who is it?
Jim,"Hey, Dwight. What's up?"
Dwight,Shut up.
Jim,"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby."
Angela,"Four, one, seven, one..."
Creed,"It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. Keep it running."
Gabe,A little un-specific.
"Pam as ""ninth-biggest client""","Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!"
Creed,Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Nellie,Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
"Pam as ""fourth-biggest client""","Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!"
Creed,Find out what language this is.
Jim,"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?"
Creed,It's Kismet!
Creed,"Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed..."
Nellie,"Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. At least once a month, the lowest performing person... bye bye!"
Jim,He never called a meeting.
Gabe,"How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?"
Creed,"BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first ""B"" stand for?"
Nellie,"Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how."
Pam,What are we doing?
Gabe,Okay.
Creed,"We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first ""B"" stand for?"
Nellie,"By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle."
Kevin,Um... Business!
Jim,I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Creed,"I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! All right! The ""O""..."
Nellie,"Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor."
Pam,We need a new manager.
Jim,That's very...
Jim,Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Nellie,"You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!"
Fred Henry,"Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits."
Gabe,"Okay, that's not gonna be..."
Jim,Really?
Nellie,"Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go."
Fred,Yeah.
Oscar,Is there a front runner?
Jim,...What is it?
Jim,You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Fred,Nice try.
Oscar,"Well, there must be someone who stands out."
Toby,"I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?"
Jim,"No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat."
Fred,"Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan."
Oscar,Well...
Gabe,"Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan."
Stanley,"The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to."
Fred,"Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?"
Ryan,"Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever..."
Gabe,"How would we know that, if you don't..."
Stanley,My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.
Jim,You could just be saying it to get the job.
Jim,Uh--
Fred,"I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?"
Meredith,"You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life."
Jim,"How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it."
Jim,"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise."
Fred,Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
Oscar,Are you?
Jim,Okay.
Ryan,Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James.
Fred,"Color-code sent documents, TM."
Jo,"Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this."
Jim,Did you just trademark that...
Gabe,All right.
Toby,W-What?
Jo,Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Fred,That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
Jim,"No, was it good?"
Jim,"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea."
Jo,"Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?"
Stanley,Good morning.
Darryl,"Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced."
Darryl,Good morning.
Jo,"Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?"
Phyllis,Good morning.
Darryl,"Paper material, ma'am."
Darryl,Good morning.
Jo,Paper material?
Phyllis,Did you have a nice drive in?
Darryl,Pieces of paper.
Darryl,I did.
Dwight,"Jo, may I speak to you for a second?"
Darryl,"I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... bla-aaack!"
Jo,Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Andy,
Dwight,"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position."
Erin,It's good. I really hope you get it!
Jo,I'll interview you right now.
Andy,"The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace."
Dwight,Okay.
Erin,"Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair."
Jo,Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Andy,Don't even... EEEHHHH!!!!
Dwight,It's complicated.
Erin,You in the boss's chair!
Jo,"Yeah, but see... it's not."
Andy,EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Phyllis,I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Andy,"In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... we'll see what Rosa comes back with."
Pam,I'm a woman. I would want to know.
Erin,Did you hear anything?
Meredith,"Yeah, you gotta know."
Phyllis,"Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results."
Kevin,"Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot."
Phyllis,It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Oscar,"You have met a lesbian in real life, right?"
Erin,"So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but..."
Phyllis,"You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family."
Phyllis,"But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out."
Pam,She does seem happy.
Erin,Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Oscar,You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Phyllis,Mm.
Kevin,We don't tell her.
Erin,But why not find out.
Pam,Okay.
Phyllis,Yeah.
Kelly,"Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?"
Pam,Should you really be so blatant about that?
Jo,Okay.
Dwight,"They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere."
Kelly,"Uh,... can it be in private? Don't worry, it's not about you. As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho."
Pam,Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Jo,"Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!"
Dwight,Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Creed,"Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant."
Warren Buffett,Can you do any better on salary?
Jordan,Who is our biggest client?
Jim,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate."
Pam,"Uh, just put him through to me."
Warren,"What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know."
Jordan,Okay.
Jim,Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Pam,Hello! This is... the client.
Warren,"How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?"
Creed,"It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?"
Angela,"Okay. How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens."
Pam,Yes.
Kevin,"The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize."
Creed,"Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma."
Toby,How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Pam,Great.
Robert California,"You don't work in sales, do you."
Creed,"All right, thank you, bye-bye."
Toby,Uh... Human Resources.
Pam,"Thank you, bye-bye."
Robert,"You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... s*x. Everything... is s*x. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby."
Erin,"Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim."
Toby,Yes.
Jo,Huh?
Gabe,"Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. Do you, um, do you think that you are?"
Erin,He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Robert,Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
Jo,"No, send him in. Who is this?"
Gabe,No.
Gabe,I have no idea.
Jim,"Can you... You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?"
Jim,"Oh, I know this guy. Hello! Mr. ""Soo-ven-yay."" Mr. ""Jacques Soo-ven-yay."" Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager."
Robert,"Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me."
Dwight,Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim,Yes.
Jim,Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Robert,"That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?"
Dwight,Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim,Yes.
Jim,What is it?
Robert,Yes. You do.
Dwight,Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim,"He creeps me out. But, I think he might be a genius."
Jim,"Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty."
Andy,"Good luck, Darryl."
Jo,I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. If he isn't here in sixty seconds...
Darryl,Thank you.
Dwight,Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... It's me. I'm Dwight.
Darryl,"Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk."
Jim,"No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the..."
Jim,Oh.
Dwight,Yeah.
Darryl,So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.
Jim,Ohhhh!
Gabe,Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Gabe,"Very unprofessional, ""Jacques."" Or, should I say, Dwight."
Darryl,Uh... yes?! I was. Little joke!
Jo,Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
Toby,"So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?"
Dwight,"I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!"
Darryl,I thought that was your job.
Jo,All that for this job.
Toby,"Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job."
Dwight,Yes.
Jim,"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?"
Jo,That's f***ing crazy. Get outta here. What a nutjob.
Darryl,"I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions."
Jim,"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, ""just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."""
Darryl,Who's that?
Jo,"Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?"
Jim,"So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?"
Jim,Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Darryl,I... I just thought you knew me.
Jo,Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
Jim,"Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. Cool?"
Gabe,How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability.
Darryl,Let me... Oh. Cool.
Jo,And that's your unbiased opinion.
Merv Bronte,"Did, uh, you just interview?"
Gabe,"Yes, it is."
Robert,"Ohh, unfortunately, yes."
Jo,So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Merv,What do you mean?
Gabe,"Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was..."
Robert,"That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry."
Jo,Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
Merv,Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job.
Gabe,That sounds like a promotion!
Merv,"Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here."
Jo,It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
Dwight,What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? What are you doing..? Stop trying to figure me out.
Jim,Um... why Kelly?
Robert,I just did.
Jo,'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
Dwight,You can't.
Jim,Okay.
Robert,It's done.
Jo,How'd my girl Nellie do?
Dwight,"No, it's not."
Jim,"Oh, I didn't know you knew her?"
Robert,"I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing."
Jo,She didn't mention it?
Dwight,Stop trying to figure me out. Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Jim,No.
Robert,I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street.
Jo,Integrity move. I like it.
Dwight,Get out.
Jim,"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit."
Dwight,"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring."
Jo,"Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy."
Merv,"You guys pay for relocation, though, right?"
Erin,Ahh!
Toby,"Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?"
Oscar,"Erin, what are you doing?"
Merv,"Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office."
Erin,I've been turned into a puppet!
Jim,Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Oscar,Okay.
Merv,"I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there."
Kevin,"Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?"
Jim,Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Erin,I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Merv,I'm having a bad time.
Kevin,"Yeah. Low blow, puppet."
Toby,"I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent."
Erin,And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Merv,Wait.
Kevin,"It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F..."
Merv,"Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met."
Erin,I need the most special thing in the office.
Angela,Thank you.
Dwight,Silence?
Pam,"It's gorgeous, Angela."
Erin,A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard!
Kelly,"Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous."
Andy,"Hey, Erin."
Meredith,Wow...
Erin,Oh.
Angela,"It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?"
Andy,Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
Meredith,Tell us the freaking story!
Erin,I've done it all my life.
Kevin,Yeah! Tell us a story.
Andy,"Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should."
Angela,"Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?"
Andy,"Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though."
Pam,Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Angela,"Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350."
Angela,"Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?"
Stanley,I'll get over it.
Pam,That's not accurate.
Angela,"I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?"
Angela,"Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide."
Pam,That was our dream wedding.
Oscar,"Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, I'm a little excited. But overall, horrified."
Angela,Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Jim,Andy? You all set?
Pam,"I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela."
Andy,"Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear."
Angela,Hmm.
Phyllis,Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Jim,All right. Name.
Andy,Augh.
Dwight,Dwight Schrute.
Erin,"I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course."
Jim,"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. We will let you know."
Jim,"So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?"
Dwight,You have to interview me...
Andy,"For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here..."
Jim,I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Gabe,Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Dwight,I demand more questions!
Andy,"I wasn't acc-, accusing..."
Jim,"All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss."
Gabe,"Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job."
Dwight,"Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it."
Andy,"Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone."
Jim,Yes.
Toby,I didn't think you were.
Dwight,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That's a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing."
Gabe,"I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!"
Jim,"Thank you, Dwight."
Gabe,How many windows are there in New York City?
Dwight,"Thank you. You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting."
Andy,What?
Jim,"Well, that was quick."
Gabe,"Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview."
Kelly,"Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed."
Andy,Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Jim,He's not a real candidate.
Gabe,No... How far away is the Sun?
Kelly,"I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat"
Andy,"Uh, 93 million miles."
Jim,You took the deal.
Jim,Is it?
Kelly,"Yeah, it was a great deal."
Andy,"Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,..."
Jim,That's not okay.
Gabe,Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN!
Kelly,"I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?"
Andy,"I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!"
Toby,"Well, we could try him out for a little while... and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in..."
Darryl,"Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say ""Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... Clippy."
Jim,What is happening right now?
Creed,"First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. Saving face. Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]"
Phyllis,Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Pam,How is this on me?
Jim,"No, why would you think that?"
Pam,Hang up. Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Phyllis,"He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me."
Creed,"Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay."
Jim,"Okay. Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss."
Pam,They're the same picture.
Kelly,"That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet."
Kelly,"Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way."
Jim,"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen."
Jim,"Your department's just you, right?"
Dwight,"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad."
Kelly,"Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage."
Jim,Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Gabe,"Great! Um, can we just..."
Andy,Tuna... You're completely sane.
Kelly,What was that?
Jim,Thank you.
Gabe,"We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so..."
Andy,"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?"
Kelly,Am I not a serious candidate?
Jim,"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?"
Gabe,"What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. Um, what are your weaknesses?"
Kevin,Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Kelly,"I don't have any, assh***."
Jim,I suppose I am.
Dwight,I want an interview.
Kevin,Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. what do 'I' want?...
Dwight,How's the family?
Oscar,"I don't think he meant, that--"
Jim,Good!
Kevin,So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Dwight,Good. They good?
Oscar,Go ahead.
Jim,Yeah.
Kevin,What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... Everyone is listening to me.
Dwight,What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Oscar,Can I say...?
Jim,Peepa.
Jim,Yes.
Dwight,"Peepa, how is she?"
Oscar,I think it should be Darryl.
Jim,Great.
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?"
Dwight,What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Jim,No.
Oscar,Kelly's on your side.
Dwight,"Now, listen,..."
Kelly,"I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer."
Jim,"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again."
Andy,"Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality."
Dwight,"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel."
Ryan,I want an outsider.
Jim,Okay. That's vivid.
Jim,Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Dwight,"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited s*x breaks for you and Pam..."
Ryan,"No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person."
Jim,Yikes.
Pam,A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
Dwight,Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Ryan,"No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it."
Jim,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes."
Pam,"No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person."
Dwight,Ha ha!
Ryan,"Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?"
Jim,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?"
Ryan,"I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led."
Dwight,"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this."
Meredith,"I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties."
Jim,Okay.
Jim,Hey! Hey! Hey!
Dwight,Let me get that for you.
Meredith,"Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny pen1s. Are you happy? Let's hire that guy!"
Jim,Thank you.
Andy,She may have a point there... would a small pen1s work? Small-to-moderate.
Dwight,Okay.
Gabe,Gotta catch a plane.
Oscar,Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Pam,"Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you."
Pam,"The Senator? He was married before, and he has a kid."
Gabe,"Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch."
Oscar,So!?
Kelly,You are not leaving without giving me a hug. Ughh.
Pam,And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Gabe,"Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound."
Oscar,I have a very strong suspicion.
Kelly,I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Pam,Did you see him at a bathhouse?
Gabe,There are plenty of people who love touching me. I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Oscar,What bathhouse?
Kevin,"Later, man."
Pam,The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
All,Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.
Oscar,What?
Ryan,"Take care, man."
Pam,Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
Dwight,"We're gonna miss you, Gabe."
Oscar,My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Andy,"Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes."
Pam,You're in the gay mafia.
Erin,"I see it. I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of and facing, and I'm like..."
Oscar,"You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. You sound ignorant."
Phyllis,"Yeah. Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point."
Ryan,"You guys, um, talking Senator?"
Phyllis,"No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day."
Pam,No.
Jim,"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?"
Oscar,No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Angela,"Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-"
Ryan,'Cause he's totally gay?
Toby,"No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk."
Ryan,"Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He ""liked"" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning."
Kevin,Exactly.
David Brent,"Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. When do I start? Yeah."
Darryl,"Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting."
Phyllis,"Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?"
Jada,"Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?"
Erin,I... I don't think I can do that.
Darryl,"Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges."
Phyllis,Bestiality. Yeah.
Jada,"I don't know if he'd be a good manager, but he's a really great dad!"
Erin,"Well, that's not my personality."
Darryl,"Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go."
Phyllis,If my daughter were asking me...
Phyllis,It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Erin,Yes?
Jim,"What? No, no, it's not a vote."
Phyllis,"I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them."
Phyllis,Then what was this all about?
Erin,I do really want him.
Jim,I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Darryl,"So, uh... here you go."
Kelly,I don't care. They can just vote.
Jim,Great.
Jim,"No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? What the hell happened out there?"
Darryl,Hope it's all right.
Andy,Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Jim,I'm sure it's fine.
Nellie,"This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend."
Darryl,"The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?"
Darryl,"Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am."
Jim,Howard Cline?
Fred,"No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... Vance Refrigeration."
Darryl,"Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about."
Merv,"Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today."
Jim,Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Robert,"I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response."
Darryl,Yes. How did he do?
Finger Lakes Guy,"I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike"
Jim,He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Dwight,"I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... I don't know. Something always works out."
Darryl,Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Creed,You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Jim,Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.
Pam,Is that right?
Creed,I think you two should meet.
Pam,"Well, okay!"
Creed,Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together.
Nellie Bertram,"First, I'll take down the cubicle walls."
"Pam as ""fourth-biggest client""",Hello!
Toby,But there aren't...
"Pam as ""ninth-biggest client""",Hello!
Nellie,"Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title."
"Pam as ""fourth-biggest client""","Hi, how are ya?"
Oscar,"Oh, for God's sake."
Oscar,"Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That's it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet."
Erin,"Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don't.  And I don't.  But I am so excited to be a part of it."
Andy,After you my good sir.
Dwight,"No, I insist."
Andy,I insist.
Jim,"The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California... for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.   And he chose..."
Andy,"I... it's unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice's first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ""I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer."" Smart, right?"
Kelly,(planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
Andy,"Uh, this has got to stop."
Kelly,I can't get down.
Dwight,K... Kevin!
Dwight,"Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great."
Dwight,"K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?"
Pam,I don't think I should.
Jim,"Oh, yeah. Pregnant."
Pam,Right here. Little Michael Scott-
Jim,"No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early."
Pam,Much different the second time around. And I have to say
Angela,"Look, it's a â€˜Little Pregs' and â€˜Big Pregs'"
Pam,"Wait, when did we start calling it that-"
Angela,"Isn't it amazing, the difference in our sizes?"
Pam,"Well, I am a few months ahead of you."
Angela,"I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman."
Dwight,"Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl."
Darryl,I'm lifting.
Darryl,"Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin' much better. This soda. This is mine."
Stanley,"It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt."
Stanley,"I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do somethin'. I go on with a long description and then I say, ""and shove it up your butt."" It's stupid, but it's my thing now."
Jim,No one should be planking at all.
Andy,"Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?"
Dwight,Say no more.
Dwight,"Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. â€˜Specially with me around."
Jim,"You watching that commercial again? Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?"
Pam,"Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone."
Jim,He's got a bank vault. That's a start.
Pam,Not enough though.
Jim,"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange."
Erin,Here we go.
Robert,Hello.
Erin,Robert California. Let's have a conversation.
Robert,Describe your day so far.
Erin,"Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-"
Robert,"And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It's a waste of your time. That's how every day's begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man."
Erin,"Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I've been doing this thing-"
Andy,"Hey, Robert. We have that 9"
Andy,First item on the agenda
Erin,"Pam, pam. Psst. Pam."
Pam,Jim.
Jim,Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. Okay. What is this?
Andy,The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
Robert,What are your thoughts.
Andy,"Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?"
Dwight,What are you looking at?
Jim,"It's, it's nothing."
Dwight,It can't be nothing.
Phyllis,"Yeah, it can't be nothing."
Jim,"It's just a list of our names, split into two columns."
Stanley,What?
Jim,"Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?"
Erin,No.
Jim,"No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?"
Dwight,Nice catch.
Pam,"If he comes out, distract him."
Kevin,We need a warning signal.
Jim,"We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-"
Kevin,We do.
Jim,"I promise you, we don't need a warning-"
Kevin,WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
Phyllis,Ahhh!
Dwight,Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
Phyllis,Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Dwight,"... 2, 3!"
Phyllis,Thanks guys.
Dwight,"Okay, which side of the list am I on?"
Jim,Left.
Dwight,Yes!
Jim,Why are you- How do you know?
Andy,Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
Jim,"Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook."
Pam,He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
Andy,"Oh, okay. I don't want any part of this."
Pam,Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire.
Jim,"Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make."
Dwight,This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an â€˜Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.
Andy,"I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam."
Jim,I don't think it's-
Pam,â€˜Scuse me?
Dwight,"Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider."
Angela,Did you guys figure it out?
Andy,We couldn't crack it.
Stanley,Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
Andy,He'll know that we looked at his private notebook.
Phyllis,"C'mon, just say you saw the list by accident."
Andy,I'm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
Phyllis,"Yeah, that's all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?"
Robert,"Yes, for god's sake Andy. Yes, come in."
Andy,"What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk."
Robert,Great. Thank you.
Andy,And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
Robert,What is this?
Andy,It's a photocopy from your notebook.
Robert,You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.
Andy,No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
Robert,"Ah, please. Here's what it is. It's a doodle."
Andy,What?
Robert,"Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don't you think? Well, I doodle too, but I'm not an artist. So I draw words and lists."
Andy,"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?"
Robert,Might as well have been sketching a cube.
Andy,"Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?"
Meredith,Maybe we're s'posed to do it with people in our group.
Jim,That's not it.
Meredith,People in the other group.
Jim,"Mmum, still wrong."
Andy,"Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?"
Stanley,"Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add â€˜em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!"
Andy,"Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys."
Kevin,I know! It's alphabetical.
Everyone,No.
Dwight,"No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... ATTACK!"
Jim,"Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!"
Andy,Dwight!
Meredith,Hey!
Kevin,Warning! Warning! Warning!
Robert,I'd like to invite the following people to join me for lunch
Dwight,That's great. Let's do this guys.
Jim,"Alright, well, I will see you in a bit."
Pam,I love you so much.
Jim,Hey. It's nothing. Alright? I'll text you when we get there. Let you know what's going on.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,Nope. No dog video.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,Okay. See you guys.
Andy,"Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!"
Robert,"Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?"
Jim,"Uhhh, the street?"
Robert,Sesame street.
Jim,"Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo."
Robert,"Elmo, god's sake, it's the Elmo era."
Jim,Right.
Robert,Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn't you agree.
Jim,"Yeah, she does like Elmo."
Oscar,Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
Phyllis,Completely.
Darryl,"Apt. Apt analysis, Robert."
Kevin,The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
Toby,"I should not be here. I'm in the- I was in the wrong- I'm- I'm sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here."
Andy,Great group! Pizza party!
Kelly,How is this a pizza party?
Andy,"Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here."
Kelly,"Yeah, well, that's just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party."
Andy,Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
Stanley,What's that?
Andy,Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
Stanley,That's pizza.
Pam,That's regular pizza.
Dwight,"You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?"
Robert,I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
Dwight,Okay!
Everyone,Awww.
Phyllis,"Well, what about the other guys."
Dwight,Losers.
Robert,No.
Dwight,C'mon.
Robert,I don't- I don't wanna say-
Dwight,"C'mon, c'mon."
Robert,"No, no."
Dwight,C'mon.
Robert,"Ha, I guess I think they're losers."
Dwight,"Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!"
Robert,Probably shouldn't have said that.
Andy,Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
Pam,"Oh, text from Jim. ""This is getting very weird. Will explain later."""
Pam,"Oh, text from Kevin."
Meredith,"""Suck it losers."""
Ryan,"Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn't the fact that I'm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!"
Pam,"I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ""Who's that receptionist? I like her."" Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you're like, ""Oh, loser."""
Andy,"C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?"
Pam,Oh. Oh God.
Kelly,Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
Angela,It was excellent.
Darryl,Good times.
Andy,Yeah?
Dwight,"Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy."
Kevin,"I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone."
Jim,"Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?"
Pam,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Kevin,Loser. Losers.
Meredith,"Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It'll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes."
Andy,"When I was a salesman I could just be like ""Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob."" Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob."
Andy,"Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier."
Robert,I never said that.
Andy,Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?
Andy,"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?"
Robert,"Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I'll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If I didn't, I don't. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong."
Phyllis,"Whew, well. I guess that's that."
Andy,"No. No, no."
Erin,"Andy, don't go in there!"
Andy,I'm going in there.
Andy,"I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list."
Robert,"I'm not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don't use ballpoint pens."
Andy,"Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?"
Robert,I did not know about the sales figures.
Andy,"Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ""no"" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with."
Dwight,"Jim, shut the door. This is just gross."
Jim,Shhh.
Andy,"Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one."
Erin,I like my new group. I liked my old group.
Robert,Are we done?
Andy,"Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we're gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend."
Robert,You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
Andy,"Yes, I do."
Robert,And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.
Andy,I don't care.
Andy,"Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday."
Stanley,We get that every year.
Andy,"Well, you got it this year too."
Phyllis,"Good night, Andy."
Andy,Night.
Angela,Bye.
Oscar,Good night Andy.
Dwight,Good night.
Andy,Night.
Jim,"Alright, I'm gonna go warm up the car."
Pam,"Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?"
Pam,"Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but- I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it."
Jim,"Hey, so this isn't matching up with this...and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?"
Pam,Baby.
Kevin,Yes. Me do.
Tattoo Artist,Baby...
Jim,Alright.
Pam,Yes.
Jim,"Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?"
Tattoo Artist,"Yeah, no problem."
Kevin,Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.
Andy,We should think about this...does anyone have any better ideas?
Pam,"Kevin, do you feel OK?"
Stanley,I like what we have.
Kevin,Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.
Meredith,Looks good.
Pam,"Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital."
Erin,Yeah.
Jim,"Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?"
Kevin,For sure.
Oscar,"No, guys."
Angela,"No, he's fine."
Andy,Just need a second outside.
Oscar,He's fine.
Jim,Gettin' psyched up?
Angela,He's always been like that.
Andy,Yeah.
Pam,No he hasn't.
Jim,"Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this..."
Angela,"I mean, he's gotten worse over the years...."
Andy,Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ....Confession
Oscar,He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Jim,"I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun....and you did that."
Kevin,You keep think that.
Andy,"My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday."
Kevin,"Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ""car no go"", and we best friends. So me think"
Jim,"But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea....which, by the way, I can't wait for."
Andy,"Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do."
Andy,"No one expects me to go through with this, right?"
Kevin,Thank.
Jim,Absolutely not.
Andy,"Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk."
Andy,Let's ink...my stink!
Kevin,But save time. More success.
Andy,My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
Jim,Does it save time though? â€˜Cause we've been here for about an hour.
Kevin,No me fault.
Group,Whoa!
Pam,"Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time."
Andy,Do your worst!
Kevin,Many small time make big time.
Tattoo Artist,"Uh, you can keep your pants on actually...if just drop â€˜em down a bit, that'd be great."
Andy,What are you gonna do with all this time?
Andy,"They are already off, my good sir."
Kevin,See world.
Tattoo Artist,I'd really prefer they not be down.
Pam,"Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world."
Andy,"Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there."
Jim,"K, Kevin, are you saying ""See the world""? or ""Sea World?"""
Pam,Do you think you could work from this? we made some small adjustments.
Kevin,See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.
Tattoo Artist,"OK, you want me to..."
Jim,"No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. â€˜Cause I still don't know if you're saying ""Sea World"" or ""see the world,"" and it's taking a lot of time to explain it."
Pam,Just a few adjustments
Kevin,"Fine, fine. I'll talk normally."
Tattoo Artist,"Alright, let's begin."
Kevin,"When me President, they see. They see."
Andy,This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
Dwight,This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid.
Tattoo Artist,That was just the cotton swab.
Phyllis,"Ooh, why is it shaped like that?"
Andy,"Invest in softer cotton, sir. OW! Oh! Oooh! oh, whoa!!"
Dwight,"So, you can tell your clients"
Dwight,"Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it."
Pam,It's huge. How much does it weigh?
Dwight,DRAW SOME BLOOD!
Dwight,"Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds."
Andy,AHHHHH!!!!!!!
Ryan,How much memory does it have without the booster?
Robert,"Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him."
Dwight,Fifty L.
Andy,"It's a Nard Dog! That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!"
Ryan,"I'm sorry,"" L""?"
Jim,Pull up your pants.
Jim,How many L to a K?
Robert,There's something about an underdog that really inspires...the unexceptional.
Dwight,You're really going to want the booster.
Pam,"Um, what should we talk about?"
Stanley,How on earth are we supposed to sell...?
Angela,"Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having."
Jim,I'll take five.
Pam,"Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help."
Angela,"A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it."
Phyllis,"Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing."
Pam,"Angela, that's pretty transparently me."
Andy,"Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting."
Angela,Maybe.
Dwight,Thank you.
Pam,You know it's just herbal tea.
Andy,"I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? What do you think, C-SPAN?"
Angela,In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
Oscar,"...""C-SPAN""?"
Pam,Yeah. I think you should call social services.
Andy,"Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause......"
Angela,I already did.
Dwight,Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Pam,"You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together."
Andy,"I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank."
Angela,Fine.
Dwight,"OK, let's look at some ties."
Pam,Fine.
Dwight,"Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise."
Dwight,Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Erin,"Um, D-Dog, you have a message."
Pam,"Erin, you don't need to call him that."
Erin,"Andy wants us to, P-Dog."
Darryl,"It's ok E-Dog, just who called?"
Erin,Justine. She said she's coming by later.
Jim,Your ex-wife?
Kevin,"Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?"
Darryl,No no no no. I like her.
Kevin,Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman.
Darryl,"Nah man, we get along now. Real well."
Jim,Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.
Darryl,I'll introduce you.
Darryl,"Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex wife last night.... I have to sing it. We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo."
Andy,Hi Dad!...... Ahhh....oh boy.
Robert,"Hello, Andy. Excellent tie."
Erin,Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here?
Robert,I'd love some coffee.
Robert,"I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better."
Andy,Are you factoring in the... whole national ...economy.... declining and all that?
Robert,"Andy, do you know why I chose you?"
Andy,I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?
Robert,Vanilla? No no no no. You'll never guess in a million billion years you'll never guess.
Andy,You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason?
Robert,"Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?"
Andy,Can I inspire? I don't know!.....I don't know.
Robert,Oh! Thank you. Uh....
Erin,"Oh, sorry."
Robert,You can just put it down.
Erin,Oh
Robert,That is very cold.
Erin,Yeah. It's old.
Robert,Why would I.....?
Erin,"I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ""coffee""...."
Andy,Why don't we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
Erin,"Andy, you don't want that."
Andy,I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. Mmm....
Erin,Sorry.
Robert,You like her.
Andy,I do.
Robert,She likes you.
Andy,"You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance...."
Robert,I'm afraid you've lost my interest.
Oscar,Let me call you back.
Meredith,I gotta go.
Robert,"If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?"
Robert,Ah...
Kevin,This is where we go
Robert,"Oh, you'd go someplace else. That's not it, that's not the answer."
Kevin,It's a answer.
Robert,It's a wrong answer.
Kevin,There are no wrong answers.
Robert,"Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?"
Phyllis,Wait....they're terrified?
Robert,"Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them ""you are welcome."" Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it."
Andy,You got it.
Robert,Double.
Andy,Done.
Robert,I'm not kidding.
Andy,"Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time."
Robert,Double.
Jim,Hey.
Andy,"What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem..."
Jim,Why don't you start?
Andy,"If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?"
Phyllis,"Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button."
Andy,OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.
Stanley,"If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense."
Jim,He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Andy,"Dwight, anything?"
Dwight,"We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house."
Andy,"You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? Tuna."
Jim,"New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door..."
Andy,Fart..... good Sesh. That leg's asleep.
Justine,Hello. I'm looking for Darryl Philbin?
Kevin,"Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here."
Justine,Ok....?
Kevin,So...DARRYL! A GIRL!
Darryl,"rub a dub dub...I got scrubbed. â€˜Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine. This is Jim and Oscar, everybody."
Meredith,Hi.
Kevin,Kevin.
Justine,Can we.... go some place private?
Darryl,"Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today."
Andy,D-Bone. There you are.
Dwight,"Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?"
Andy,"No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about..."
Dwight,Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.
Andy,"I know, right?"
Dwight,Right?
Andy,"Yeah...um, how is everything?"
Dwight,Good. Really really good.
Andy,Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
Dwight,"Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back."
Andy,Oof. What are you gonna do about that?
Dwight,"I don't know, what do you mean?"
Andy,There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...
Dwight,"You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! And I'll do mine..... walnuts?"
Kevin,No!
Angela,Have you seen this?
Pam,Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
Jim,"She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces."
Angela,Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
Pam,I flipped through it.
Angela,So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?
Pam,Of course.
Jim,We know that.
Pam,Yeah.
Angela,I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?
Pam,That sounds nice.
Angela,Great.
Jim,You have a walking buddy.
Pam,I do.
Andy,Thanks for coming in guys.
Phyllis,"You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job."
Andy,Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.
Meredith,What's with the blanket?
Andy,This is what's under the blanket.
Oscar,We don't get it.
Andy,"These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves"
Pam,"Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes."
Andy,You're exactly right and you get a point.
Pam,Oh.
Ryan,"Uh, is that a vibrator?"
Andy,Twenty points.
Meredith,How does one get a point?
Andy,"I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear."
Kelly,Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross.
Andy,"There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt."
Stanley,"How â€˜bout you want us to work harder, pay us more."
Andy,I can't.
Kelly,This point system is really insulting.
Andy,"Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very... Sari. Sixteen points."
Kelly,That's a tablecloth.
Jim,What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
Andy,That's a crazy amount of points.
Jim,"But, what if?"
Andy,"Well, what do you want?"
Jim,"I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy."
Andy,"Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work."
Jim,"That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?"
Andy,"I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard!"
Group,Ooooh!
Oscar,Really?
Jim,"Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?"
Andy,"Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!"
Jim,"Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work."
Dwight,Yeah!
Pam,Yeah! Whoo!
Jim,"I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?"
Phyllis,"Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas."
Jim,Ok.
Andy,T-bag bone...
Jim,Andrew.
Andy,Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
Jim,"No, I didn't notice anything."
Andy,Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years....and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.
Stanley,You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
Jim,"I don't know what to tell you, man."
Andy,You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
Jim,"Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass."
Andy,Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
Jim,"Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in."
Andy,Hundred and twenty points.
Jim,"Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though... Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much."
Pam,Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's?
Erin,Yes!
Jim,"and I'm back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?"
Pam,Where's Angela?
Andy,"Hey Kevin, what are you doing?"
Kevin,Don't talk to me!
Andy,"Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey there, um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here...De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale...uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations."
Andy,Took â€˜em one day.
Pam,"Ready! ""I'm not as think as you drunk I am!"""
Ryan,"I like it, I like it!"
Pam,Do Not Resuscitate...
Andy,"OK, keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car for a thousand points....or best offer."
Phyllis,What else you got?
Pam,"Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea... So nasty Phyllis!"
Pam,We were hoping you could do something like this...
Tattoo Artist,"So, coming out of his butt is a..."
Dwight,....back orders and you never called them.
Darryl,My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
Oscar,Can you believe this?
Darryl,"I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch."
Erin,There's a dog in the car.
Andy,"Yeah. That makes sense. OK. Good, alright."
Oscar,"You can't leave a dog in a parked car. Snowboarder, it figures."
Kevin,Here...
Jim,Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Andy,What is goin' on?!
Oscar,I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
Kevin,Oh hey guys.
Andy,"Oscar, it's not that hot out."
Darryl,Why is the forklift in the wall?
Darryl,A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
Andy,Why is the truck empty?
Andy,"Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight."
Dwight,"Uh, it's not totally empty."
Kelly,"So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?"
Darryl,Is that grease on my floor?
Kevin,"Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog."
Dwight,"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this."
Dwight,"OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. Come on."
Darryl,And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
Jim,Dwight! At least aim it.
Kevin,"OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them."
Dwight,"There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on."
Jim,"OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things."
Andy,We're losing cloud cover.
Darryl,And?
Kelly,"Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick."
Erin,And we did.
Darryl,"Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time."
Dwight,I don't know.
Oscar,This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window.
Erin,Jim? Tell them what it's called.
Jim,Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Jim,That's alright.
Oscar,"Come on buddy, get back."
Kevin,"No Jim, tell 'em what a name is."
Dwight,"Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!"
Jim,"Doesn't matter what the name is. SeÃ±or Loadenstein, that's stupid."
Jim,"Alright! Nice job, Oscar!"
Kevin,"SeÃ±or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim."
Oscar,And one for good measure!
Jim,"That's OK, we're good."
Jim,"So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?"
Erin,Jim...
Oscar,Why would we take the dog?
Andy,"No, Jim. Tell us why it's called SeÃ±or Loadenstein."
Jim,What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
Jim,Porque es muy rapido.
Oscar,"Jim, he's not gonna star-"
Dwight,"OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away."
Meredith,Whoa!
Darryl,Let me see it.
Oscar,"Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay."
Dwight,"It's uh, it's in beta testing."
Dwight,Nein. Sits. Goot.
Darryl,Let me see it!
Jim,"Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?"
Dwight,"Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping."
Oscar,There we go. That should do it.
"Dwight, Erin, Jim & Kevin",Uno! Dos! Tres!
Jim,"Yeah, that's pretty good."
Phyllis,"Yeah, I lost my client."
Dwight,"Yeah, that'll work."
Creed,"I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport."
Kelly,That'll work.
Toby,"I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. Flenderson files."
Jim,Nice job.
Pam,We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Dwight,Bye poochie!
Jim,Right. It's city and country combined.
Kelly,Bye.
Pam,Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
Meredith,Bye!
Jim,And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Pam,"What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?"
Pam,Just like now.
Jim,"Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars."
Jim,Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
Pam,Awesome.
Pam,Oh..
Dwight,Before taxes.
Jim,But what are you gonna do about that?
Phyllis,That's still a lot of money!
Pam,What are you gonna do?
Andy,"The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things."
Darryl,"Hello?....Justine! Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- Whoops."
Darryl,"When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ... playing my birthday."
Oscar,What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
Phyllis,Yeah.
Meredith,We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird s*x thing.
Oscar,At least.
Jim,"I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money."
Dwight,"I know what you'd do with all that money. ""Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug."""
Jim,"No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop."
Pam,"And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?"
Jim,Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
Pam,I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
Ryan,SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
Pam,"And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting..."
Kelly,"Oh, god."
Pam,And then my handsome husband...
Jim,Which ideally would be me....
Pam,Would bring me a flavored coffee.
Jim,Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
Pam,Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
Jim,"I don't know about Stephen King, I mean..."
Meredith,get a divorce...get a divorce...
Kelly,"I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill."
Andy,"Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?"
Darryl,I don't know.
Andy,"What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?"
Darryl,No.
Andy,Are they on their way over?
Darryl,I haven't hired anyone.
Phyllis,What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Darryl,I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
Andy,This is kinda time sensitive.
Darryl,I got it. I'm doin' it.
Phyllis,"Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client."
Andy,"Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in?"
Erin,As long as you guys don't need me up here.
Phyllis,No..we don't
Dwight,I think we'll be fine.
Oscar,"Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?"
Andy,Are you volunteering?
Oscar,Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent.
Andy,Jim! How 'bout you?
Jim,"Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you..."
Dwight,"Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. False. Andy, I will volunteer."
Andy,Great. And Kevin.
Kevin,Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Pam,"Oh, thank you."
Angela,Sure.
Pam,"Wait, wait. What's this?"
Angela,"Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool."
Pam,"It says ""Lotto Pool"", right on top."
Angela,Yeah. And I said sorry.
Pam,Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
Darryl,When did I get so fat?
Andy,You look awesome.
Darryl,I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
Andy,Where are we in the process?
Darryl,"I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process."
Andy,Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
Darryl,The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
Andy,You do have a fantastic basement.
Darryl,I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
Andy,"Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out.Hey! There ya go...there he is."
Andy,That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
Jim,"OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad."
Dwight,"Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!"
Jim,Nice. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
Kevin,Damn!
Dwight,Yup.
Andy,"Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?"
Darryl,You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Female Applicant,Your old crew won the lottery?
Andy,"Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?"
Male Applicant 1,"Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?"
Darryl,Oh yeah.
Andy,Well-
Darryl,"One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals."
Andy,"Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?"
Darryl,I don't
Andy,"You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so..."
Darryl,Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
Andy,"Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about."
Darryl,OK.
Andy,"We need you, OK?"
Darryl,OK.
Andy,OK?
Darryl,Yeah.
Andy,Alright.
Dwight,What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.
Erin,I didn't feel anything.
Andy,"Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor."
Darryl,Why do you wanna work here?
Male Applicant 1,I need a job.
Darryl,That's not a good reason.
Andy,Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
Darryl,"Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you're still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change."
Andy,Are we scaring them straight....?
Darryl,I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
Darryl,"I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?"
Ryan,Nice. Right back where I like you. Can you make ten copies of this for me?
Pam,No.
Ryan,Why not? What are you doing?
Pam,"Uh, buying lottery tickets online."
Ryan,"Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it."
Pam,You came in at 10
Ryan,"OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????"
Andy,Is everyone licensed?
Male Applicant 2,Like a driver's license?
Andy,"No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind."
Female Applicant,Is this a joke?
Andy,"No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now."
Kevin,"OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back."
Jim,There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
Dwight,"Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday."
Jim,Yeah Not that they're not smart people.
Dwight,"No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence."
Jim,I'd go with that.
Dwight,Like baboons or elephants.
Jim,"Not that, don't..."
Kevin,"Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh."
Jim,"It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-"
Kevin,Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
Dwight,Kevin! Doesn't apply.
Kevin,Right. My mom-
Erin,"You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!"
Andy,Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
Male Applicant 1,How much longer is this gonna take?
Darryl,Did you hire 'em?
Andy,No. Because they all left.
Darryl,"What do you mean ""they left""?"
Andy,"I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help."
Darryl,Then I think you should fire me.
Andy,What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
Darryl,Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
Andy,".....OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke."
Darryl,No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
Andy,"So Darryl says to me ""fire me"". But what he really means is ""I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means."" So I say ""No, you're not fired."" But what I really mean is ""I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.""........I really hope that's what he and I mean."
Andy,"Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy."
Oscar,Bulk or definition?
Andy,Definition.
Oscar,Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
Andy,Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
Oscar,"Oh, he's plenty strong."
Oscar,"It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell."
Pam,"So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings...."
Jim,Our fake winnings
Pam,"And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France."
Jim,"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it."
Pam,"Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy."
Jim,"Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now."
Dwight,"Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?"
Jim,A...hot chocolate tea
Andy,Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
Gideon,"North America...and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That's the headline version."
Andy,"Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse."
Gideon,"FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule."
Andy,"Eh, cool. We'll figure that out."
Nate,"Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing."
Andy,Got it. Dually noted. You! Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
Bruce,Made it.
Andy,So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
Dwight,"Message in a Bottle, The Postman..."
Jim,Kevin Costner.
Dwight,Kevin Costner.
Jim,Yeah.
Kevin,So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Erin,You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
Jim,"So, it's not the dumbest idea."
Dwight,It's not the greatest one either...
Jim,"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes."
Dwight,And it's clear we're not going to carry them.
Jim,"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table."
Dwight,Exactly.
Kevin,I think we're ready to give thi- Jim?
Jim,Is he OK?
Dwight,Yep. He'll be fine.
Andy,Surprise! Your new crew.
Darryl,"Would you just fire me, man?"
Andy,Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
Darryl,You wanna make me happy? Huh?
Andy,Yeah.
Darryl,Give me your job.
Andy,"Haha, what?"
Darryl,"I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me."
Andy,"I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that."
Nate,"Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises..."
Andy,"Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?"
Darryl,He died.
Andy,"He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?"
Nate,"What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-"
Andy,"None, no part of this has anything to do with you."
Darryl,I didn't have time because of my daughter.
Andy,"Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class."
Darryl,Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
Andy,Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.
Darryl,OK.
Andy,OK what?
Darryl,"OK, don't fire me."
Andy,"Ah, OK."
Jim,"Hey. So, we saw a new billboard."
Andy,"Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?"
Andy,What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
Andy,How'd it look?
Jim,"You've seen it, right?"
Andy,No.
Pam,"Andy, somebody defaced it."
Andy,"What? Morning, Stanley."
Jim,"There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity."
Andy,"Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?"
Erin,Six months.
Andy,"Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company."
Meredith,"Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it."
Andy,Which one did you see?
Meredith,"Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it."
Jim,"Okay, don't be gross."
Dwight,What's going on?
Pam,Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
Dwight,"Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?"
Andy,"Yeah, Dwight."
Dwight,"No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!"
Dwight,"Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far."
Ryan,Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Dwight,It's simpler this way.
Oscar,It's really not.
Andy,"Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m."
Kelly,I don't get the reason for this party.
Phyllis,"Yeah, what's the reason?"
Kelly,"What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?"
Andy,It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
Andy,You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
Andy,"Few other super simple reminders â€“ no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?"
Darryl,"What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?"
Andy,"I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up."
Oscar,"Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children."
Phyllis,"Yeah, it's just a picnic."
Andy,"This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party."
Darryl,There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
Andy,"Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules."
Pam,How is that better than a barbecue?
Ryan,What's the dress code on this?
Andy,I'm glad you asked â€“ Connecticut Casual.
Stanley,"Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party."
Andy,"Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet."
Kevin,"Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this."
Darryl,"I've seen this, that's not you."
Meredith,"Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?"
Andy,"It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time."
Jim,"Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?"
Andy,"Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did."
Phyllis,Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
Gabe,"I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?"
Andy,"See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time."
Dwight,"And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you."
Jim,"So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view."
Dwight,They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Jim,"Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?"
Dwight,There's so much more to it than that.
Dwight,"I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars."
Jim,I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. I've only sold one copy.
Angela,Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
Pam,Nope.
Angela,I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
Pam,"Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier."
Angela,Phillip?
Pam,"Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather."
Angela,Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
Pam,"Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather."
Angela,It's after my cat.
Robert,"Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade."
Andy,"Ooh, that sounds great."
Robert,"Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade."
Andy,Sure.
Robert,You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.
Andy,"Uh, I'll hear the other one."
Robert,It's a basil plant.
Andy,"You know, the marmalade sounds great."
Robert,I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
Andy,Then the basil will be fine.
Robert,"Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright."
Toby,"Hey, where do I park?"
Mose,I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.
Toby,"Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself."
Mose,I'm the... I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.
Toby,It's probably okay...
Mose,Give me your car.
Toby,I think it's better that I...
Mose,Give me your car.
Toby,It's a finicky car...
Mose,Get out. Have a good time at the thing.
Toby,"It's a little tricky, you might have to... take..."
Dwight,MR. RYAN HOWARD!
Jim,"Chapter 2 â€“ Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present."
Dwight,"STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!"
Andy,"How's it going over here, guys?"
Oscar,"Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying."
Andy,"Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table."
Oscar,Wow.
Dwight,MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
Walter,"So, you all work with Andy."
Andy,"Well, technically FOR Andy."
Oscar,Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
Ellen,I thought you were the CEO.
Andy,I don't know how you got there.
Walter,You said you were running the company.
Andy,"This branch, I'm the regional manager."
Walter,"Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?"
Andy,"Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less."
Andy,Can I introduce you around now?
Walter,"Uh, yeah, we don't have too long, we have theater tickets."
Andy,What are you going to see?
Walter,Money Ball. Walter Jr.'s choice.
Andy,What??
Walter Jr,Hey Bronard!
Andy,I didn't know you were going to be here.
Walter Jr,I wouldn't have missed it.
Erin,Ahh!
Walter Jr,"I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother."
Jim,"Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim."
Walter Jr,"Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam."
Jim,No.
Meredith,Hell no. She wishes.
Jim,"No, no, no, no, no. No."
Waiter,"Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests."
Kevin,I understand.
Dwight,Set that down. Present yourself.
Jim,Chapter 4 â€“ One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
Dwight,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!"
Robert,Hello Andy.
Andy,Welcome.
Robert,Thank you.
Andy,"Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad."
Robert,"Yes, hello, nice to meet you."
Walter,Pleasure.
Robert,"Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?"
Andy,"Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade."
Robert,"No, I'm certain you said basil."
Ryan,"This is not funny, man, let me down."
Kevin,I think this thing is broken.
Ryan,"It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works."
Andy,So pretty today.
Ellen,It's getting chilly.
Walter,We really should be leaving.
Andy,"Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff."
Andy,"Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity."
Andy,"Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?"
Darryl,"Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California!"
Gabe,"I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?"
Angela,"I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!"
Pam,"I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!"
Angela,She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
Ryan,I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides.
Erin,I think we should toast...
Dwight,Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
Jim,"Chapter 9 â€“ The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party."
Kevin,Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
Gabe,"I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,..."
Andy,You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
Robert,"I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy."
Andy,"Yeah, yeah."
Robert,"You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers."
Gabe,"To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you..."
Andy,"Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!"
Walter,"I'm eating, Andy."
Andy,"Ah, come on!"
Walter,Okay. Okay.
Andy,Yes!
Walter,What do you want to do?
Andy,"Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?"
Walter,"Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It's a little tricky."
Andy,Saying I love you is not the words...
Walter,It's too high.
Andy,Yeah?
Walter,It's high but it's not that high.
Andy,"Right, it feels strange."
Walter,Just take it down a little.
Andy,Saying I love... Saying I love you...
Walter,"Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like... Saying I love you is..."
Andy & Walter,...not the words...
Walter,"You don't come in yet. ...I want to hear from you, It's not that I want you..."
Andy & Walter,...not to say it but if you only knew... More than words is all you have to do to make it real...
Andy,Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
Erin,It's either taping or calling.
Andy & Walter,What would you do if my heart was torn in two...
Walter,"You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us?"
Walter Jr,"Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here."
Meredith,Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
Walter & Walter Jr,"May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you'd have done to you..."
Andy,"Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar."
Erin's Cell Phone,"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
Erin,Sorry.
Kelly,I am so cold.
Ryan,That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
Dwight,"My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?"
Robert,Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
Dwight,"Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?"
Robert,Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
Dwight,"I can get you exotic meats â€“ hippo steaks, giraffe burgers..."
Robert,We'll talk.
Dwight,It'll all be goat.
Andy,"Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call."
Walter,Hi. What was that display?
Andy,"I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me."
Walter,Andrew...
Andy,"I know, I know that you're proud of me."
Walter,"I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs..."
Darryl,"I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too."
Oscar,Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
Darryl,Rosebud?
Oscar,It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
Darryl,"I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed."
Oscar,Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
Darryl,No. You're wrong.
Robert,Are you sure?
Ryan,Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
Robert,"My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you."
Walter,"It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food..."
Ellen,Sandwiches were dry.
Walter Jr,"Bye Tuna, bye Pam!"
Andy,"Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry."
Darryl,Cheeseburger or hamburger.
Andy,"Um, cheeseburger."
Oscar,Narddog.
Andy,"Thanks, Oscar."
Pam,What are they doing?
Jim,Closing ceremonies.
Pam,Nice touch.
Jim,I think I left my wallet in your house.
Dwight,Who cares.
Jim,Right here.
Dwight,MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Jim,"Keys, keys..."
Dwight,Stop forgetting things.
Jim,"I didn't forget them, they're right here."
Dwight,MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Jim,"I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing..."
Dwight,What? Idiot.
Jim,Whoo.
Dwight,MIS... MI... What are you doing?
Jim,"Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?"
Dwight,"That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!"
Andy,Approved!
Meredith,"Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps."
Andy,"Chef from South Park, it's genius!"
Robert,What am I up to?
Stanley,Just some chef.
Jim,"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, ""Mom, there's a ghost in my closet."" Now, you say one of two things - one, ""You're just having a bad dream,"" or two, ""Let's go see what it was."""
Andy,"I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously."
Pam,"I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim."
Kevin,The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Jim,Ok.
Andy,"Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert."
Pam,"I'm not gonna lie to her, either."
Kevin,"It's been out for ages, man."
Jim,"Oh, come on!"
Andy,Costume vetoed.
Robert,"When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter."
Andy,"Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that."
Creed,Oh my goodness.
Phyllis,Who?
Robert,"The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies."
Andy,Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
Kevin,Nooo!
Kelly,This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
Robert,"Amongst them was a man, tall, slim."
Andy,"Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just..."
Meredith,Jim.
Kelly,"Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here."
Robert,"Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. ""Oh, wait,"" she thought, ""I don't have a husband."" For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, ""Baby, are you okay?"" Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, ""I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine."""
Meredith,Because I was there. Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
Bert,
Andy,I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
Robert,"Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear."
Meredith,"What I said was, ""My sister's funeral is this weekend."" Didn't say I'd be there."
Bert,Toby?
Meredith,"Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it."
Toby,"Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry..."
Andy,"Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?"
Bert,You're fired.
Erin,Here you go.
Toby,...bones. What?
Andy,There you go. Thank you.
Bert,You heard me. Pack your things.
Erin,"When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day."
Toby,What... you can't... Gabe? Are you...
Kevin,"Jim, put it on."
Bert,I'm the CEO's son. Pack your things. You're done.
Darryl,"Put it on, man."
Jim,I don't know if I can.
Kevin,"Come on, the Three Amigos."
Darryl,Three Kings.
Jim,Alright.
Jim,"I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh."
Ryan,"If you get into season 1, you can really..."
Kelly,"Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?"
Dwight,It's called a costume.
Kelly,"What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?"
Dwight,"Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?"
Ryan,Whoopi Goldberg.
Dwight,"Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault."
Toby,"Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey."
Andy,"Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?"
Andy,"I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - ""Boo!"" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - ""Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high."" Scared the s**t out of me."
Andy,"G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?"
Pam,Yeah.
Andy,Australian accent...
Pam,What are you doing?
Erin,"Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't."
Pam,Oh. Are you...
Erin,"That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?"
Pam,"Oh, Erin..."
Erin,"Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?"
Pam,"Um, 2?"
Erin,"That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear."
Pam,"No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?"
Erin,Yeah...
Pam,Yeah.
Erin,"Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny."
Phyllis,Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Oscar,I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
Pam,"Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello."
Oscar,"What happened, Pam?"
Pam,"Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story..."
Phyllis,"Wait, they have food there?"
Pam,"...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black."
Jim,No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,Hey!
Jim,"Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?"
Pam,What do you mean?
Jim,"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?"
Pam,I saw a ghost.
Jim,"Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?"
Pam,"It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date."
Jim,"Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it."
Pam,"I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost."
Andy,"Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!"
Robert,"Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer."
Andy,Yes.
Robert,"Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company."
Bert,Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane.
Robert,"Here, use this one."
Robert,"Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?"
Erin,"Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?"
Bert,That stuff's for babies.
Robert,"Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us."
Andy,"Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool."
Robert,Extraordinary. Did you plan this?
Kelly,"Well, Toby and I did, yeah."
Gabe,"And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do."
Toby,If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
Kelly,"1, 2, 3!"
Gabe/Kelly/Toby,"Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew."
Robert,Delightful.
Kelly,Thank you.
Robert,"Now then, how are we today?"
Kelly,Fine.
Toby,Great.
Robert,"Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?"
Kelly,Mmhmm.
Robert,You feeling fulfilled in your life?
Kelly,I guess.
Robert,"You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have."
Kelly,I try not to think about it.
Robert,"Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?"
Kelly,Never marrying.
Robert,"Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?"
Toby,So great.
Erin,"Oh, I put those up."
Angela,I know. I'm taking them down.
Phyllis,I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
Erin,"I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so..."
Angela,"Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?"
Erin,Oh.
Angela,"So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this."
Bert,"Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm."
Dwight,"Yeah, perfectly mediocre."
Bert,"What are you, anyway?"
Dwight,"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul."
Bert,"If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft."
Dwight,Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
Bert,"If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl."
Dwight,Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
Bert,"Yeah, she also has boobs."
Dwight,"Yeah, but no nipples."
Erin,Hey.
Andy,Hey. What's up?
Erin,"November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!"
Andy,Yeah...
Erin,"Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?"
Andy,"Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG."
Erin,"But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?"
Andy,"Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call."
Erin,"Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can."
Andy,Yes. I don't know. Mmhmm.
Erin,Gabe?
Gabe,Sweetheart.
Erin,I'm throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.
Gabe,Ok where does Gabe factor in?
Erin,Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn't stop crying?
Gabe,Yes. Lars and Decocco's
Erin,"Ok. Let's say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just... more adult... more... scary and sexy"
Gabe,I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
Erin,No â€“ just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
Gabe,Oh that would be scary!
Erin,What are you thinking?
Gabe,Ok let me go get it.
Pam,Pam Halpert.
Jim,Hey it's Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I've read a lot about this really great documentary.
Pam,Is it called Ghostbusters?
Jim,It's called Ghostbusters.
Pam,It didn't look like that.
Jim,It didn't have a buster sign around him? Why don't you draw him? Why don't we see this whole thing.
Pam,Ok fine I'll draw him.
Jim,I ain't fraid of no ghost. Whoa!
Pam,Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?
Dwight,It's a root you idiot.
Bert,Everyone hates you.
Dwight,That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.
Bert,What do you like? Tornadoes?
Dwight,Try influenza.
Bert,Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?
Dwight,Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane's coming. I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Bert,Try a box jelly fish.
Jim,You know that's...
Robert,What are we talking about?
Jim,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Robert,You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don't scare you?
Kevin,I'm only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies.
Oscar,Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums.
Kevin,Yeah...prank
Robert,It's true. They've been preserved for thousands of years. They're all over.
Kevin,Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Erin,Witch's brew?
Erin,I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!
Jim,Party looks fun doesn't it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
Bert,I'm using it. I'm about to play Starcraft with him.
Jim,Are you serious?
Dwight,Yeah I'm serious.
Jim,That's funny. Ok.
Dwight,Loser.
Bert,Yeah.
Angela,Pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before? When I wasn't pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
Oscar,Hey guys. I'm an Oscar liar weiner.
Ryan,Oh my god!
Darryl,This party's tight. The fog is cool.
Erin,Thanks. It's on medium.
Darryl,Perfect.
Andy,It really looks great. You did a great job.
Erin,"Oh, so we don't have to have that talk."
Andy,We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4
Erin,Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.
Gabe,The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
Oscar,Is that my grandmother?
Andy,What's the story?
Oscar,There is no story.
Gabe,Yeah it seems like there isn't a narrative. Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
Stanley,What the hell is going on here?
Andy,I think we've seen enough. You can turn it off now. Yeah turn it off now.
Stanley,How did you get in my car?
Oscar,Where is this from? That is so upsetting!
Andy,That was awful. Robert I apologize.
Erin,"I'm sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now. This game is called ""pecker Poker"". It's the game of cards that gets you hard."
Andy,What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
Robert,Why didn't you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You're obviously very close.. Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business.
Erin,All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so...
Robert,You were going to talk at the end of the... I'm not here.
Andy,Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn't. I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
Robert,I'm never uncomfortable.
Andy,Ok. Erin I think you know I've been dating someone.
Erin,Sure.
Andy,And it's getting a little more serious. She's never come by.
Erin,And she's never called here. Unless it's your mom.
Andy,No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it's weird that she's not calling.
Erin,Two dates? Three dates?
Andy,Thirty-one.
Erin,Wow. I'm so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I'll see you guys.
Robert,I should go.
Darryl,"I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person."
Jim,Thank you.
Pam,Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Jim,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win."
Pam,Really.
Jim,No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Kevin,Exactly.
Jim,Thank you.
Dwight,"Go, get up there right now."
Bert,Got it.
Darryl,Dwight?
Dwight,"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B."
Bert,Unleash the hellstorm.
Darryl,Dwight.
Dwight,Nice.
Darryl,Dwight!
Dwight,Got 'em. Go!
Phyllis,Is she Asian?
Erin,"I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest."
Phyllis,Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
Erin,"I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city."
Phyllis,Hmm.
Robert,"Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?"
Creed,No...
Robert,Are you scared of snakes?
Creed,"You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby."
Darryl,"[in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive."
Andy,Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here.
Dwight,Don't say cow- Ugh.
Erin,
Andy,What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
Andy,Closing time.
Pam,"Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will."
Andy,"Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird."
Andy,That's insane!
Andy,Closing time
Pam,Just trust me.
Jim,...W R K.
Andy,"Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning."
Andy,One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
Pam,I got this.
Jim,"Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing."
Andy,Enngh-
Andy,Come on pam!
Pam,"Hahhh, thanks for everything."
Andy/Pam,"Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from."
Dwight,Sive drafely.
Pam,Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
Kevin,"Isn't it supposed to be, ""Drive safely""?"
Andy,"I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. Take me hooo...hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing... no traditions!"
Jim,Is that my phone?
Stanley,Closing time every new beginning...
Robert,Sounded like mine.
Stanley,"I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now...it's my favorite song."
Jim,"Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright."
Andy/Stanley,Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Robert,"Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag."
Stanley,Goodnight.
Jim,"Oh, oh yeah."
Andy,Whose your favorite iron chef?
Robert,Can I have it?
Robert,This is atrocious.
Jim,Yes. Right now? Yes.
Andy,You go first.
Robert,Yep.
Robert,"The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office."
Jim,Here you go.
Andy,Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes...
Robert,"Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa."
Dwight,"Sorry, go ahead."
Robert,"ha, Jesus."
Robert,Did you need something from us?
Jim,"Awww, sorry. Did it break?"
Dwight,Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all.
Robert,"Nah, it's good."
Dwight,"Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted ""We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants."
Jim,You sure?
Robert,Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.
Robert,Yeah.
Andy,Umpf...that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
Jim,What kinda iPhone is that?
Robert,Who are they?
Robert,It's the standard one. The one everyone has.
Andy,"They're both Kevin. Oscar is the s*x and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture..."
Jim,Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
Robert,Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.
Robert,It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?
Andy,I would agree with that.
Jim,"Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-"
Robert,Simply...end the mistakes
Robert,My serve!
Andy,"End the mistakes, easy-"
Pam,Dwight stopped the device!
Robert,"When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice?"
Andy,Oh!
Andy,I would like that.
Kevin,Yes!
Robert,End the mistakes. That is all I ask. And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all.
Erin,Haho!
Jim,"I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So...my pitch is...me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine."
Oscar,He stopped it!
Darryl,Nahh! No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
Ryan,Oh! We still have our jobs.
Jim,Is that off again?
Dwight,"They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?"
Darryl,Oh yeah.
Robert,Take it easy. Nice and easy.
Jim,Ok.
Jim,"Ah! Classic, right?"
Val,"Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today."
Robert,Oo!
Darryl,Ahh...We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
Jim,I'm alright.
Val,Are you really this lazy?
Robert,You alright?
Darryl,I'll be there.
Jim,Yep.
Gabe,Hey.
Robert,Skinned knee.
Val,Hey.
Jim,Yep. Ah. Oh.
Gabe,Monday's suck.
Robert,"Oo, a little ice on that maybe."
Val,Yeaha...yup. Just trying to get in.
Jim,Yeah. That does not feel good.
Dwight,"I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it."
Robert,Okay. My serve.
Andy,What do you got?
Dwight,"Allow me. You're going to love this. Ugh...should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work."
Andy,Sounds controversial.
Dwight,Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
Andy,Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
Dwight,"Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead."
Andy,Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
Dwight,I will do my voodoo.
Andy,Mmhmmm.
Gabe,Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
Toby,For you?
Gabe,Yes. For Gabe.
Toby,Who are you seeing? That's gr...
Gabe,Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
Toby,Oh.
Gabe,"I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So.."
Toby,You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
Gabe,"Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?"
Toby,But I mean...uh have you talked to her? Is sh...
Gabe,Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays...
Toby,"Do you know her last name, yet?"
Gabe,Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
Toby,She's going to be screaming her own last name?
Gabe,Hey! Watch it.
Toby,Good luck Gabe.
Andy,"Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really."
Kevin,Thank you.
Andy,"And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight..."
Dwight,The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
Andy,"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper."
Dwight,Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Kelly,What emails are you talking about?
Dwight,Robert's favorite songs
Kelly,That's not that bad actually.
Dwight,P.S. We should should kill him.
Jim,"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?"
Dwight,"No, it's an accountability booster."
Jim,Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Dwight,"Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task."
Kelly,"Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives."
Ryan,We can't do this Dwight.
Dwight,Smile...nod. Smile and nod.
Dwight,"They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like...not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor..."
Andy,"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes."
Dwight,"But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve."
Andy,"Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha."
Stanley,This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
Oscar,There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
Dwight,"Oh, there's one mistake."
Erin,Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
Andy,Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I...
Dwight,"It's not a doomsday device, gosh. We can do this you guys."
Warehouse Crew,First. Second.
Darryl,It's not a race.
Warehouse Crew,Thirrrr....third.
Darryl,Who knows what the belt is for?
Gabe,"It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous."
Darryl,"Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone."
Warehouse Crew,"Hi, gabe."
Darryl,All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
Gabe,"Look at this, this is enormous."
Gabe,I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard.
Gabe,It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
Darryl,You done?
Gabe,"The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back."
Phyllis,Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
Kevin,I'm on it.
Angela,"Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project."
Kevin,Good thinking.
Kevin,"Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made."
Angela,"Oscar, use a calculator."
Oscar,"When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds."
Andy,"Alright everybody, you are doing great!"
Dwight,"Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work."
Jim,"Dwight, question."
Dwight,No questions.
Jim,If this doomsday device goes off...
Dwight,Accountability booster.
Jim,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
Dwight,I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Stanley,Try mose1234.
Ryan,"Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like...z64$8. Not that exactly Jim, something like that."
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,How about Scrantonstrangler666.
Jim,Nope.
Dwight,"No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha...You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike."
Kelly,Wha...what's Dwight's mothers name.
Jim,Hmm...Heda. No.
Darryl,"Once you read the packet, sign the back."
Gabe,"Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val..."
Darryl,"Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back."
Val,"Yeah, sure."
Gabe,Uh.
Darryl,Mmhmm. Caramel soy latte.
Gabe,Decaf frap-
Darryl,Got it.
Angela,You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
Oscar,"Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty."
Angela,"Six-seventy, six-twenty."
Oscar,Nuh uh.
Angela,yes!
Oscar,Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
Kevin,What does this mean? What does it mean!
Oscar,Andy.
Angela,Ohhhh!
Andy,Gahhh. That's five strikes.
Stanley,"Well...I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today."
Andy,Dwight we got five strikes.
Dwight,Really?
Andy,Did the email go out or...
Dwight,It goes out automatically at five P.M.
Andy,"Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it."
Dwight,"Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it."
Andy,Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
Dwight,No.
Andy,What?!
Dwight,You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
Phyllis,We did our best.
Dwight,"No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. What?!"
Erin,"You're a real crumb bum, you know that?"
Dwight,"Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?"
Kevin,"Uh, the man tree puts its penis-"
Dwight,"Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please."
Andy,Nn no.
Dwight,What?
Andy,No!
Oscar,Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
Kelly,Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! Shut it down! Shut it down!
Dwight,Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
Erin,Dwight's car is gone.
Pam,I bet he went home.
Andy,Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
Andy,"Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us."
Kevin,Yeah.
Andy,Kevin has that lovability.
Kevin,Guys come on. I'm right here.
Andy,"Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something."
Jim,"Ok, where is he?"
Erin,"Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash."
Jim,I'll try both.
Dwight,Oh. Come to reason with me?
Andy,"Gotcha something. And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-"
Dwight,Get lost.
Andy,"Well now hold on it, it-"
Pam,What are you doing?
Dwight,What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
Pam,Uhm.
Erin,Do you need a hand?
Pam,"Yeah, do you need a hand?"
Dwight,"If you hit another horse, you've dug to far."
Robert,I'll see you next week Will.
Jim,Robert.
Robert,Jim what are you...What a surprise.
Jim,"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting."
Robert,Yeah.
Jim,You up for a game?
Robert,A game or a match?
Jim,Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
Pam,"Are you okay, Kevin?"
Andy,Where you going?
Dwight,In. I'm hungry.
Pam,"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water."
Dwight,"Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on."
Pam,"Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is."
Dwight,"This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009."
Val,That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
Darryl,"Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?"
Val,That's what I'm sayin'.
Gabe,Hey. You're welcome.
Val,Thanks for the coffee.
Gabe,"So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me."
Val,Are you asking me on a date?
Gabe,"Yes, I am."
Val,"Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy."
Gabe,I could quit. Problem solved.
Val,Don't quit.
Darryl,Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
Jim,Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
Robert,In the box.
Jim,In the box.
Oscar,Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4
Angela,"Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-"
Oscar,I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
Stanley,"I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha!"
Oscar,It's not that funny.
Erin,"Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt."
Pam,"Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?"
Dwight,"Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's ""Nobody's perfect."" Nice stroke, Pam."
Pam,"No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha."
Dwight,"I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny."
Andy,"Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-"
Pam,You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Dwight,Any specific animal?
Pam,I'm thinking cow-
Andy,Erin.
Pam,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
Erin,Yeah.
Jim,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?"
Andy,In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I'm not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
Pam,"Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now."
Erin,Who's calling?
Dwight,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate."
Andy,Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I'm going to refuse to take it.
Pam,"Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do."
Erin,You're not going to take it?
Dwight,And she called it nuts?
Andy,Just make up a phone call. It's not a real call. Make it up.
Darryl,"Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going."
Erin,Ohohohoh.
Kevin,Mm-hmm.
Andy,And come and tell me. Doesn't matter what it is.
Andy,Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
Erin,You're not going to get it though?
Kevin,Are you serious? From Star Trek?
Andy,"I'm not going to take it. And then he's going to be like ""whoa this is a really important meeting""."
Darryl,"Hey, you caught some of that?"
Erin,Copy that.
Val,I caught it.
Andy,Okay.
Darryl,"What, you don't like the blues?"
Andy,"Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I'll tell you how we can beat it."
Val,I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
Client,Uh well we've been going with...
Andy,"Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us."
Erin,Andy.
Val,I think the music left without you.
Andy,Yeah.
Dwight,Come on.
Erin,You have a very important call.
Jim,Stop shoving me.
Andy,I'm sorry â€“ I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.
Dwight,"Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my pen1s. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs."
Erin,"Are you sure? It's really, really important."
Jim,Really?
Andy,There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
Pam,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Erin,Really? Because your mother is dead.
Old Man,"Uh, are you all in line?"
Client,Oh my God.
Dwight,"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?"
Andy,I don't think she's dead.
Jim,Si.
Erin,She's dead. She was hit by a bus.
Pam,"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?"
Andy,She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
Dwight,We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
Erin,This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen.
Old Man,You have to share the machine with others.
Dwight,Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
Dwight,"Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten."
Client,Oh you must take this call. It's...
Jim,"Okay, Dwight, come on. You can go first."
Andy,Yeah. Um line 1?
Old Man,Thank you.
Erin,Line 2.
Dwight,"Jim, are you serious?"
Andy,Hi.
Jim,"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush."
Darryl,It's Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
Andy,Maybe we could switch instruments.
Andy,"Ooh, gosh!"
Kevin,Yeah.
Darryl,Dude.
Andy,"'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised."
Andy,Officer.
Darryl,"Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?"
Darryl,Look man this is a bad idea.
Andy,We had to leave because of creative differences.
Andy,Did she have any last words or?
Darryl,Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
Darryl,Really? That is messed up man.
Kevin,"Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now."
Andy,Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
Darryl,"No man, we are."
Darryl,You're a bad man Andy Bernard.
Andy,Well-
Andy,That is so mom.
Darryl,"No, no, no."
Darryl,That stuff can come back to get you. It's called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle...
Dwight,"Okay, you're done."
Andy,Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
Old Man,"I have a new heart, you know."
Pam,Hey Cathy.
Dwight,"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?"
Cathy,Hi.
Jim,"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time."
Pam,How's it going? Everything make sense?
Dwight,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
Cathy,I think everything is under control.
Jim,No.
Pam,Great.
Dwight,"Yep, he's lying."
Cathy,You should sit down.
Pam,"Ah, see, was that so hard?"
Pam,"Oh no, I'm fine."
Jim,I am not lying.
Cathy,No I should go fill out my paperwork.
Pam,Really?
Pam,Ok Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
Jim,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?"
Dwight,Oh we know.
Dwight,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?"
Pam,I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh I should've mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice because it's impossible to tell I'm so small. But yeah I'm pregnant. Oh come on!
Pam,"Wait, what?"
Ryan,Hey â€“ asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Dwight,"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar."
Jim,Hmm. Doubt it.
Pam,"Jim, you have high blood pressure."
Ryan,Yeah me too.
Dwight,"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her."
Pam,You doubt it?
Pam,Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?
Jim,What's that?
Jim,"Yeah, but I don't smoke."
Pam,Why do you doubt that she's single?
Pam,When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Jim,Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?
Jim,I don't know.
Darryl,What are you doing with my lunch?
Dwight,It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Andy,I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
Pam,"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?"
Darryl,It's not pizza.
Jim,"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul."
Andy,Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
Dwight,"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man."
Darryl,I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
Jim,Okay.
Andy,Uh you tell me
Pam,"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor."
Ryan,So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
Dwight,Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
Gabe,Well he's probably a drug dealer. That's the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
Pam,Just go home. It doesn't matter.
Toby,"It's going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office."
Dwight,"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush."
Oscar,Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
Jim,Thank you.
Offscreen,Good energy
Andy and Darryl,Oh baby I love your way.
Pam,It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh?
Darryl,Every day.
Oscar,"No, no. Not even."
Andy and Darryl,Wanna be with you night and day.
Pam,I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing.
Darryl and Kevin,And day.
Oscar,Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Andy and Darryl,Oh baby I love your way.
Toby,Radiant.
Andy,Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.
Pam,Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
Phyllis,Yeah you have this sexy glow.
Gabe,It's one of the most common fetishes.
Pam,Really well thank you all.
Toby,You know it's not just pregnant women who don't get their due. You know who's gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
Ryan,Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
Toby,You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It's a pregnant Helen Mirren.
Dwight,Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
Oscar,In this case yes.
Dwight,No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Phyllis,No we're not.
Dwight,Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Andy,"Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray."
Darryl,"Nice scatting, man."
Andy,Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
Val,"Not bad fellas, you're better than you look."
Kevin,"Hey, screw you!"
Andy,"Hey Robert, are we meeting early?"
Robert,Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?
Andy,Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
Robert,You're a band.
Andy,Thank you.
Kevin,We're called Kevin and the Zits.
Darryl,That was never agreed upon.
Robert,I miss being in a band.
Andy,Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
Kevin,I have a tambourine.
Robert,"Tambourine? You know I'm the CEO, right?"
Andy,CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
Robert,I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.
Andy,Great!
Kevin,"Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!"
Darryl,"Again, never agreed upon."
Andy,"I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!"
Darryl,"Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?"
Andy,"Yeah, even cooler."
Kevin,We all got to go sometime.
Pam,Hey.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,Helen Mirren. Hot?
Jim,Yeah. Super pretty.
Pam,Huh. What about Cathy?
Jim,The temp?
Pam,Yeah. Do you think she's hot?
Jim,Nope.
Pam,"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?"
Jim,"And I'm telling you, I don't."
Pam,You don't find Cathy attractive?
Jim,"No, I don't."
Jim,"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody."
Pam,Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Jim,"Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good?"
Dwight,That's just absurd.
Pam,"Yes, because she's hot, right?"
Dwight,"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on."
Pam,"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth."
Pam,"Dwight, am I hot right now?"
Dwight,"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction."
Pam,What about before? Was I attractive before?
Dwight,"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low."
Pam,Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Dwight,You think Jim's lying? That's so cute. I know he's lying.
Pam,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
Dwight,Done. I never touch a pregnant woman.
Pam,"Yep, that's the Dwight I need."
Dwight,"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules."
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,Rule one
Pam,I think so. Okay.
Dwight,Rule two
Pam,"Well, what does that... is that... okay."
Dwight,Rule three
Pam,"Yep, good."
Dwight,We're gonna bust this guy.
Pam,Honesty is very important to me.
Dwight,So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
Pam,Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
Kelly,"Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam."
Dwight,None taken. What do you got?
Kelly,"It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot."
Pam,Hmm.
Robert,"Hey, you found us!"
Curtis,"You guys sound great, man."
Robert,"Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding."
Darryl,Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
Kevin,"Dude, you're on TV! You're the sportscaster on channel seven."
Drummer,Go Eagles!
Kevin,You do that on TV!
Robert,You guys mind if they join us?
Andy,"Yeah, absolutely!"
Kevin,"Guys, I've got some instruments right here."
Darryl,"Hey, why don't you and me play those?"
Kevin,"Yeah? Okay, this is awesome."
Robert,What should we play?
Kevin,Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
Robert,Midnight Rambler?
Curtis,Yeah.
Andy,Midnight what?
Curtis,"Have you heard about the midnight rambler? Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!"
Pam,"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single."
Jim,"Oh, I stand corrected."
Pam,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
Jim,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets."
Pam,"Mike Tibbets, really?"
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Ryan,"Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?"
Jim,Not his mom's car.
Ryan,"Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z."
Jim,Touche?
Kelly,Eww!
Pam,"Kelly, calm down."
Kelly,"I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs."
Pam,I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
Kelly,"Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person."
Dwight,I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
Pam,Jim's on to me.
Dwight,Hmm?
Pam,"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it."
Dwight,Just ugly enough to have deniability.
Pam,Yep.
Jim,"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy."
Dwight,"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body."
Kelly,I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
Pam,"No, Kelly, don't."
Dwight,"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there."
Pam and Kelly,With the crotch?
Dwight,With the crotch.
Kevin,Whoo!
Dwight,Psst. We're not here.
Creed,Who said that?
Dwight,Exactly.
Creed,How'd I get this long triangle?
Dwight,"Okay, just shut it."
Pam,Is he puffing out his chest?
Dwight,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Pam,No. Maybe he just said something funny.
Dwight,"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that."
Pam,I think he's just making her laugh.
Dwight,Time for me to find out.
Pam,Why's he making her laugh so much?
Dwight,"Just going to walk over here- whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!"
Jim,Dwight!
Cathy,Are you okay?
Dwight,"I'm fine, I'm totally fine."
Jim,Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight,Yes? Wha- Jim.
Jim,Sorry about that.
Dwight,"Aw, cramp, I'm just-"
Jim,Dwight! Why?
Dwight,"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance."
Jim,Leave.
Dwight,"Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft pen1s for nothing."
Pam,Why was he making her laugh so much?
Pam,"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second."
Cathy,"Yeah, take your time."
Pam,Okay.
Cathy,"Oh, that line from Zoolander?"
Jim,Mm-hmm?
Cathy,It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
Jim,Told you.
Cathy,"Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-"
Pam,"Oscar, Cathy has a question!"
Cathy,"Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar."
Pam,Yeah?
Jim,You okay?
Gabe,"The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-"
Kelly,"Oh my God, kill me!"
Andy,"Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay."
Gabe,"Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-"
Pam,I'm gonna do it.
Gabe,And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
Pam,Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
Jim,"Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!"
Pam,"I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary."
Pam,
Phyllis,Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
Pam,I'm going into labor!
Ryan,"Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-"
Pam,I'm going into labor.
Pam,Here we go!
Andy,"Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it."
Kelly,Yeah.
Oscar,"It's not fair, you guys."
Kelly,Pitiful.
Meredith,It's stupid.
Andy,Never cry wolf.
Jim,Okay.
Pam,Okay.
Erin,Oh.
Pam,Oh! Oh!
Everyone,Oh! Oh my goodness!
Jim,Oh my God!
Pam,I'm really in labor! This is happening!
Jim,"Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!"
Pam,Oh!
Jim,How do you feel?
Erin,Drive carefully!
Oscar,Good luck!
Everyone,Goodbye! Good luck!
Pam,False alarm.
Andy,"What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there."
Andy,I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
Andy,Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
Erin,It's right here in PA.
Andy,"Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-"
Angela,"Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg."
Andy,That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
Dwight,Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Oscar,Actually it is the northernmost.
Dwight,Ha!
Dwight,The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
Andy,Charge!
Phyllis,"Well, this could be fun. I-"
Andy,"Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?"
Ryan,What's the halal option?
Andy,"Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese."
Ryan,Out.
Andy,"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?"
Erin,I'm in.
Phyllis,I'm in too.
Dwight,Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
Andy,"Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge."
Kevin,Yes!
Andy,One for you.
Erin,Cool. Thanks.
Andy,And one for you.
Jim,Cool. Thanks.
Andy,"And- oh. You missed your head. There you go. Phyllis, think fast!"
Andy,"All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War."
Darryl,"You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV."
Phyllis,Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Andy,"It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it."
Everyone,Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless!
Andy,"All right, all right, all right."
Kevin,Not food and stuff.
Pam,Here. Like it?
Kevin,"Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit."
Pam,I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
Kevin,The fire pit is a no-brainer.
Robert,"Oh, hi there."
Pam,"Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again."
Robert,Where is everyone? Where is Andy?
Kelly,Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
Robert,"Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office."
Ryan,"Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon."
Robert,"So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! Excited!"
Kevin,Okay.
Andy,You guys...
Darryl,J-j-j-ju...
Andy,Get excited!
Darryl,Shh! Movie's almost over.
Andy,All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
Gabe,"Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'"
Andy,Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
Darryl,I got Source Code on the way back.
Everyone,Ooh! All right!
Andy,Woo!
Andy,"Whoa, where you going?"
Jim,"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?"
Andy,"Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists."
Jim,"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour."
Phyllis,"Yeah, sign says ""Begin tour here."""
Andy,Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
Andy,"After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch."
Erin,"Yeah, but I'm confused..."
Dwight,"Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre..."
Erin,Mm-hmm.
Dwight,...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Erin,Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Dwight,"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written."
Oscar,"Dwight, what are you telling this girl?"
Dwight,The truth.
Oscar,"Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better."
Erin,"Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said."
Dwight,"No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth."
Erin,Interesting.
Dwight,"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed."
Oscar,"Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?"
Dwight,"Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-"
Oscar,he's a historian.
Dwight,"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?"
Oscar,"Yes, yes, yes!"
Dwight,Not by a long shot!
Erin,No!
Oscar,Yes!
Dwight,"No, it was not!"
Oscar,Argh!
Dwight,"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?"
Oscar,What?
Dwight,Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Oscar,Erin-
Dwight,"Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar."
Erin,Get out of here!
Robert,"I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?"
Ryan,May I go first?
Robert,Absolutely.
Ryan,"Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper."
Robert,This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
Ryan,"Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-"
Robert,That was bad.
Stanley,"If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister."
Robert,"The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with."
Stanley,In the African-American community-
Robert,No.
Stanley,Thought it was worth a try.
Darryl,"That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?"
Park Ranger,"Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-"
Dwight,"Excuse me, I got a question for you."
Park Ranger,Sure.
Dwight,Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
Park Ranger,"Uh, I haven't heard of that one."
Dwight,"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?"
Oscar,I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
Andy,We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
Chelsea,Are you Lincoln?
Gabe,"No, no, I'm-"
Gabe,"Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it."
Chelsea's Mom,"Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture."
Gabe,"Okay, Quick."
Man,Hey! Lincoln's starting.
Gabe,"Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny."
Pam,"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it."
Robert,I am not.
Pam,"Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
Pam,"At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet."
Robert,"Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is."
Kevin,"Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So..."
Robert,Cookies. Cookie placement.
Kevin,"Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'"
Robert,"Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? There you go. Consensus."
Ryan,"Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy."
Gabe,"I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits."
Audience,No!
Kevin,"'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... like, forget it."
Robert,Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
Stanley,how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Robert,"That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic."
Kevin,Thank you.
Jim,"By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?"
Andy,Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
Jim,"Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry."
Andy,Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
Darryl,Hunger for hamburger.
Erin,"Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?"
Darryl,That's good.
Andy,"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars."
Jim,Only two hundred dollars?
Andy,"We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left."
Darryl,"Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man."
Andy,"Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!"
Andy,Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
Jim,Oh wow. So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Andy,Its... I mean come on.
Phyllis,"I don't think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus."
Andy,Alright fine. You know what â€“ I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me.
Dwight,You said you weren't going to look back.
Robert,And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
Kevin,I don't know.
Robert,Right. I mean you're an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
Kevin,Yes. I am an accountant.
Oscar,Dwight â€“ this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.
Dwight,Really?
Oscar,Yeah.
Dwight,Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Archivist,Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.
Oscar,You've heard about it?
Dwight,YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.
Archivist,There you go.
Narrator,Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front.
Soldier,Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris.
Dwight,Hallowed ground.
Narrator,But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.
Amanda,"You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers â€“ these kind of men preferred peace to war. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive... and well... fabulous."
Oscar,Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.
Dwight,I've seen enough.
Oscar,You're right. There should be a monument to this.
Kevin,Never trust a cookie with a woman's name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They'll just break your heart.
Robert,Kevin!
Ryan,Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea.
Kevin,What?!? No!
Robert,Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging.
Ryan,"It's really, really good Robert. Let me explain."
Kevin,No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me.
Robert,Well what is the idea?
Kevin,Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
Ryan,You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. That is 100 percent your idea.
Robert,Oh my. It was just actually cookies the whole time?
Andy,Dammit.
Darryl,Hey.
Andy,You guys came. Where's everyone else?
Darryl,Back at the bus. We were locked out. Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
Andy,Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.
Jim,Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come. I think they're just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.
Andy,Even without an audience you're still at it.
Jim,What are you talking about?
Andy,Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip.
Jim,"Andy â€“ this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It's just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you're our regional manager. And guess what man? You don't have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head. I'm wearing a very pink hat. I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure ""DM does GB"" means something kinda sexual. But guess who's wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That's huge."
Andy,You don't like the hats?
Jim,They're terrible.
Darryl,I hate myself.
Andy,"They just didn't turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird."
Andy,"The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that's good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager. Yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that I think about it."
Gabe,Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. Oh Mary this is wonderful... Ok Mary stop your scolding. I'll be quiet. I need her like I need a hole in the head! BANG! Ooh
Dwight,"Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning."
Susan,"Answer the question, please."
Dwight,"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR."
Jim,"I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking."
Dwight,Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.
Robert,All right. Thanks.
Creed,No. No. No. You're way off on that one.
Jim,Yes. All right. Great.
Dwight,Oh yeah?
Andy,Uh...
Oscar,Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Robert,Yeah.
Jim,"Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?"
Andy,Yep.
Dwight,That's right Jim.
Susan,Thank you.
Darryl,Hey man.
Robert,Heh.
Dwight,Hey.
Susan,Andy.
Darryl,Taking a load off huh?
Andy,"Hey, Mrs. California."
Dwight,No. Putting a load on more like it.
Susan,"Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today."
Darryl,Good luck with that.
Andy,"You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me."
Dwight,Last thing I need is luck.
Susan,"Yeah, I thought we really hit it off."
Dwight,Thank you so much.
Andy,Yeah.
Jim,What are you up to? Oops look out!
Susan,"Well, different circumstances."
Dwight,What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Andy,Yeah.
Jim,Prank!
Susan,Who knows?
Dwight,Oh that's real creative.
Andy,Who knows?
Jim,You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Susan,Maybe after all this settles down...
Dwight,"I could, but I just don't feel like it loser."
Andy,Totally.
Jim,Because you're sitting?
Susan,It's a date.
Dwight,Standing.
Andy,Hmm?
Jim,Ok.
Dwight,"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?"
Dwight,Don't!
Darryl,This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Jim,Because you're sitting?
Dwight,"Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!"
Dwight,Standing.
Darryl,"Dwight, come back and spot me."
Jim,You know I have to do this.
Dwight,"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?"
Dwight,I know.
Darryl,To push this bar up.
Andy,Andrew... Baines... Bernard.
Dwight,"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?"
Jim,I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Darryl,Help me!
Andy,"Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers."
Dwight,What do you want!?!
Robert,In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
Darryl,To look good for Val!
Andy,What was that?
Dwight,Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
Jim,I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.
Ryan,That's why my foundation â€“ The Dream for a Wish Foundation â€“ is going to put them out of business. They're not going to know what hit them.
Robert,Everyone. I'd like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
Susan,Hello. Oh call me Susan please.
Robert,Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she's here today to see if there's a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.
Susan,Hello nice to meet you.
Andy,Hey there. It's a pleasure.
Robert,Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she'll shine.
Andy,I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up.
Robert,Andy. Let's see if there's a good fit first. Then we'll talk.
Andy,Alright.
Dwight,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock."
Darryl,You don't have to say it if you're doing it.
Dwight,Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Darryl,Uh weight lifting yeah.
Dwight,Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Darryl,I'll take a look.
Dwight,Your path from obesity begins right here!
Darryl,"I've been meaning to join a gym. For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents."
Dwight,"Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash."
Andy,Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
Susan,Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Ryan,Actually Ryan.
Susan,"Oh, Ryan."
Ryan,Bitttch!
Andy,We will start here at Erinville.
Susan,Hi.
Erin,Hoo-hoo!
Andy,Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
Erin,Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Andy,I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Robert,Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring
Andy,I'll explore exploring it.
Robert,Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I'll just duck out and run the company for a while.
Andy,Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. Alright have at it. Let â€˜er rip. What do you hate about this place?
Jim,Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Dwight,Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Andy,Jim?
Jim,Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.
Dwight,It's the second easiest job in the world. Being a mom.
Susan,I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Dwight,That is true.
Andy,You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
Dwight,That's me.
Andy,Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
Dwight,Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale.
Susan,Well make that a red wine and I'll tell you my animal rankings.
Andy,Oh how am I supposed to pull this off?. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.
Dwight,Ready? What do you think?
Darryl,Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Dwight,You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month...
Darryl,Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Dwight,Darryl...
Darryl,Make a real gym.
Susan,I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Andy,But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Susan,Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Andy,Those are fully staffed as well.
Robert,Are you telling me that there's no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
Andy,Yes.
Robert,I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
Andy,Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Susan,Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there's no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don't we just let it go.
Robert,No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
Andy,There are lots of considerations.
Robert,I would be eternally grateful. It's not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
Andy,Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
Susan,So what happens next?
Andy,We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. Hang on. Hello?
Robert,Say hello grandma.
Andy,Hi gam-gam.
Robert,"Hold one finger up to Susan. You'll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ""are you taking your medicine?"""
Andy,Are you taking your med-meds?
Robert,Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it.
Susan,You didn't say goodbye to your grandma.
Andy,We promised we'd never say goodbye.
Dwight,Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Oscar,All I need is another gym. As if I don't have enough drama.
Phyllis,We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom.
Oscar,Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says...
Angela,"Enough Oscar, enough."
Dwight,Kelly?
Kelly,I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
Dwight,That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
Toby,Did you bring your passport with you?
Susan,Who walks around with their passport?
Toby,"Well, I do. Always ready for adventure."
Susan,Have you had any?
Toby,No.
Andy,"Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away."
Oscar,"Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?"
Andy/Oscar,it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Kevin,How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
Angela,This is all pathetic.
Andy,"I am not asking, I am ordering."
Oscar,How mean are we talking about?
Andy,"It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable."
Erin,Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
Erin,Here you go.
Susan,"Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer."
Erin,Well that's a sales desk.
Kevin,"Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know."
Jim,"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing."
Oscar,That's Gerald.
Jim,"Oh, wow. So cute."
Susan,"Oh, that is so cute-"
Phyllis,Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Oscar,"Yeah, he's in a ladle."
Erin,That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Oscar,He did it himself.
Phyllis,Is that ladle stainless or...
Oscar,"Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma."
Susan,"Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup."
Oscar,It's not that kind of ladle.
Jim,Very cute.
Susan,"Aw, let me see-"
Oscar,"Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this."
Susan,"I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert."
Susan,Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Robert,"Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this."
Andy,What is going on?
Robert,"Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night."
Andy,"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?"
Susan,Do you not want me here?
Andy,Why would you say that?
Susan,It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
Andy,"It's not that, exactly."
Susan,But it is something.
Andy,"Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that."
Susan,Why would you not want me working here?
Andy,I don't know.
Susan,"I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?"
Andy,Yes! The dude is an enigma.
Susan,"Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?"
Andy,Ah...
Susan,Got it.
Dwight,What do you think you're doing?
Darryl,Getting my sweat on.
Dwight,"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?"
Darryl,"I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill."
Dwight,I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
Darryl,No.
Dwight,Eight minutes!
Darryl,"Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow."
Dwight,Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Darryl,It's Lejon Brames.
Dwight,That's what I said.
Darryl,"You know, get it right."
Dwight,I know.
Andy,Cameras...
Robert,"Oh, still here. Terrific."
Susan,Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
Robert,Well that's a shame.
Andy,It just was one of those things-
Susan,Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Robert,Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
Susan,"No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him."
Robert,"What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person."
Susan,You sure about that?
Robert,Absolutely.
Susan,No games?
Robert,No games.
Susan,Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Robert,"Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest."
Susan,Andy?
Andy,Yes?
Susan,Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Robert,"Andy, just answer the question."
Andy,No games?
Robert,No games.
Andy,"Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, ""in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen."""
Robert,You lying son of a bitch!
Robert,Tell my wife you're lying.
Andy,I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
Susan,"That's not true, is it?"
Andy,"No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there."
Robert,This is preposterous.
Susan,Robert...
Robert,Let's get Jim in here. Where's Jim?
Erin,He just rolled out and crawled out.
Robert,"Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this."
Jim,"Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay."
Robert,"That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere."
Jim,"Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. Creed. I was never here, all right?"
Creed,Okay. What about your friend?
Jim,Oh boy.
Dwight,"This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked."
Darryl,"Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say."
Dwight,"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor."
Darryl,"Okay, I'm not doing that."
Dwight,Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
Gabe,I didn't know Darryl joined.
Darryl,Looks that way.
Gabe,Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
Robert,Hello Jim.
Andy,"No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!"
Robert,So I think you know what we want to know.
Jim,Do I?
Robert,Yes.
Jim,"I know, I do."
Andy,"Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness."
Jim,I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Susan,"For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?"
Jim,"That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something"
Andy,I think we've got ourselves an answer.
Robert,No.
Andy,That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Jim,Perfect!
Susan,Jim...
Jim,Yes?
Andy,"Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true."
Ryan,I'm trying but you need to-
Andy,Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
Erin,Hey.
Stanley,Holiday wishes.
Kelly,Yo.
Andy,"What's that, Stanley?"
Erin,Game on.
Stanley,We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Kelly,On it.
Andy,It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
Jessica,"I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful..."
Stanley,"I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas."
Kelly,"Jessica, did you just fart?"
Jim,I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
Kelly,"And that, is how it's done."
Stanley,"I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!"
Erin,I would like another alcohol.
Meredith,What is the status on my wish?
Robert,"Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar."
Andy,"Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required."
Oscar,"What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?"
Dwight,What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Robert,Your heart is broken. So is mine.
Andy,"That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon."
Erin,And...
Dwight,Where? Dark side or light side?
Robert,And what?
Andy,Light side.
Erin,And you have any advice or anything?
Dwight,Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
Robert,No my god.
Andy,"As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront."
Erin,...Help me feel better...
Dwight,"Thank you, Andy."
Robert,"I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better."
Andy,"So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is."
Nate,"When you do your makeup,"
Jim,"She's not your grandmother, is she?"
Jessica,Uh huh.
Andy,"Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?"
Nate,"How long you, does it take usually? Cause..."
Jim,Yeah.
Jessica,"Um, it ta-, um it depends."
Andy,"Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee."
Toby,.....Chad Flendermen's kryptonite.
Creed,"That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?"
Creed,Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
Andy,"Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam."
Darryl,Hi.
Erin,"I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home."
Jessica,I'll see you at home?
Kelly,I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
Andy,OK great.
Erin,"Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly."
Jessica,OK
Kelly,It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
Andy,Perfect.
Erin,"That's OK, I don't want you to do that."
Jessica,Bye...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
Robert,"Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati."
Andy,"I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish."
Kelly,"Eww, what is that?"
Jessica,Oh
Robert,"The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts."
Meredith,Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
Kelly,Cool.
Jessica,OK Bye.
Kevin,"Hey, man."
Andy,"OK, bye. Alright Meredith,"
Robert,Hey! Oh!
Meredith,Thank you Santa.
Kevin,How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Andy,You bet.
Oscar,Kevin?
Andy,"Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,"
Robert,I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
Andy,"Let's go, let's go."
Kevin,Yeah.
Meredith,"I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Robert,It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
Andy,Hang on.
Andy,"Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up."
Meredith,Alright.
Robert,"I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking."
Andy,What?
Andy,"Oh, thank you."
Meredith,Whoa! My stuff!
Andy,"Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps."
Andy,What is all that?
Dwight,Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Meredith,It's my valuables!
Jim,It wasn't me.
Andy,It's junk!
Andy,It wasn't either of you.
Meredith,"This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!"
Jim,Kathy wants to leave our clump?
Andy,You're a hoarder. My god!
Andy,Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
Meredith,"No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful."
Dwight,"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense."
Andy,Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
Jim,"Ow, What are you doing?"
Dwight,"What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?"
Andy,Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
Meredith,Where are we? This ain't my street.
Jim,Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Andy,"Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh."
Andy,Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
Meredith,"Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?"
Jim,What was that?
Andy,Oh my god.
Dwight,What is it?
Meredith,Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
Andy,"Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person."
Andy,"Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now."
Jim,Can't do that.
Robert,"Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning."
Dwight,"No, absolutely not."
Erin,"Thank you, goodnight."
Andy,You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
Meredith,What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Jessica,Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
Andy,I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
Erin,"Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. I'm Erin."
Meredith,Ow! Take it easy.
Jessica,Oh! Oof!
Andy,Whoo.
Erin,"Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here."
Dwight,"Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?"
Jessica,Oh.
Oscar,Dwight.
Andy,"My ex is meeting my s*x....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s...that's just part of it."
Dwight,"Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?"
Andy,"Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my pen1s. Hi."
Jim,"Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. I got nothin'."
Jessica,Hi.
Andy,"Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr."
Erin,Wow.
Andy,"Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist."
Jessica,"Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office."
Erin,"Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess."
Andy,What?
Jessica,Oh.
Erin,Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.
Andy,Oh no.
Jessica,Ah..
Andy,"Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis."
Jessica,Spontaneous scoliosis.
Erin,Oh.
Darryl,"This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution."
Val,Thank you.
Darryl,Alright.
Val,Alright.
Darryl,"Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about."
Val,Isn't that just for popsicles?
Darryl,Popsicles?
Val,"Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?"
Nate,"Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. I, in my, I..."
Darryl,"Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid."
Nate,"You had me at ""clookies."" I can't wait to find out what they are."
Val,What should I wear?
Darryl,"Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up."
Nate,"I will look so handsome for you, Darryl."
Jim,Ah... I'm gonna s-
Jim,"Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink."
Robert,"Erin, what can I get for you?"
Erin,"Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it."
Robert,"Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!"
Ryan,Yes!
Oscar,Yes!
Ryan,Will do.
Robert,"The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too."
Phyllis,"One, two three!"
Kevin,Yes.
Erin,OK.
Robert,Mmm. Wow.
Erin,Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
Robert,Jiminey Christmas indeed.
Erin,Hit 'er up.
Robert,Oh.
Kevin,Oh yes.
Ryan,Whoo!
Erin,Yeah!
Oscar,Wow.
Jim,"Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye."
Jim,"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me."
Dwight,Boom!
Ryan,"But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed... whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do..."
Kevin,Good cookie.
Darryl,I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Val,OK.
Darryl,I thought you'd wear a sweater.
Val,"Since when does a sweater mean ""dressed up""? Am I your grandson?"
Darryl,"Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you."
Val,"As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe."
Erin,"I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. and then I want my nap!"
Stanley,That's right.
Erin,Whoo! Thank you.
Robert,"She, she is remarkable."
Andy,Edgy impressions.
Erin,Thank you.
Andy,How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
Erin,A thousand.
Andy,Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
Erin,Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding!
Dwight,Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Toby,Oh my god.
Dwight,"Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!"
Jim,"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?"
Dwight,Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
Jim,Hmm...
Toby,You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
Toby,"Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist."
Angela,Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
Toby,"No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife."
Dwight,Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Jim,"Nice try, this is ridiculous."
Dwight,Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
Jim,Three times.
Dwight,You see?
Andy,"Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it."
Jim,"Andy, you've gotta be kidding me."
Toby,Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
Kelly,Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
Jim,"OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control..."
Dwight,Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Angela,No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
Jim,"Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up."
Dwight,Come down right away!
Jim,"Uh, I don't know, let me ask. Uh, were you quilled?"
Dwight,"Yes, I was quilled."
Jim,And what's it's name?
Dwight,Henrietta.
Jim,Oops.
Andy,"What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight."
Erin,"Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? And you both have such beautiful hair."
Jessica,Thank you.
Erin,"I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone."
Andy,OK!
Erin,"And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. Ah! OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ""get a drink""."
Jessica,"That's uh, that's the girl you dated."
Andy,"Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um..."
Jessica,"No, she, she seems fine."
Andy,"Yeah, uh, excuse me."
Jessica,OK.
Andy,Yep. Hey!
Erin,Hey.
Andy,Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
Erin,Every martini has an olive.
Andy,OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
Kevin,"I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk."
Erin,"Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish."
Andy,"Ah, OK."
Erin,It's about you.
Andy,"That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something."
Erin,It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
Andy,"You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something."
Erin,I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Andy,"Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back."
Erin,"Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar?"
Kevin,Hey.
Erin,Hey.
Kevin,"So, there was talk of oatmeal."
Phyllis,"You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess."
Val,Yeah. Thanks.
Andy,I swear...
Jessica,Did you not...
Andy,I was too embarrassed!
Jim,"Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?"
Phyllis,Is that Cici?
Jim,Yes. It is.
Andy,Um.
Phyllis,That's awful.
Andy,Cici is Jim's daughter.
Jessica,Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
Jim,"I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though."
Oscar,Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
Jim,I don't-
Andy,I know who did this....Dwight.
Phyllis,Dwight?
Jim,Yeah.
Andy,Dwight.
Oscar,No!
Phyllis,He should pay.
Andy,Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
Jim,O...K.
Andy,"It's, I mean."
Jim,"Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like..."
Oscar,That's no accident.
Jim,Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Phyllis,What?
Oscar,What?
Jim,"I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry."
Dwight,Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas. Hi-yah!!!!! Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Jim,"You alright, Santa?"
Andy,"You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?"
Jim,Yes.
Andy,Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
Jim,"Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah."
Andy,"No...I don't, hmm, I don't know."
Jim,OK.
Andy,"By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work."
Jim,Alright. I will definitely do that.
Andy,"Alright, I'll tell Dwight."
Jim,"You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway."
Andy,Christmas miracles do happen.
Jim,Yes. They totally do.
Ryan,"You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses."
Kelly,"Well help me, OK? Just, uh take..."
Kevin,Oh yeah!
All,Aw!
Dwight,Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Oscar,"You really have to say ""oh yeah"" every time you eat a candy bar?"
Kevin,"I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. Oh yeah!"
Jim,"All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to."
Andy,It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
Dwight,You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Jim,"Okay, done."
Erin,Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Darryl,Check out this song I wrote
Jim,"All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-"
Andy,"Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?"
Jim,You can write a book about chairs.
Andy,"Books! Excellent, Jim."
Oscar,"Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-"
Andy,"Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?"
Jim,Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
Andy,"I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!"
Angela,"Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?"
Andy,Yes!
Andy,"Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage."
Dwight,"Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine."
Dwight,Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
Receptionist,"Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all?"
Dwight,I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Receptionist,"Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat."
Gabe,Dwight? What are you doing here?
Dwight,Gabe? You don't know?
Gabe,Course I know.
Dwight,"Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office."
Gabe,"Corporate says to me, ""Gabe, we need you in Scranton."" Scranton says, ""Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there."" So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying."
Robert,Dwight.
Dwight,Robert.
Robert,You made it.
Dwight,Yes.
Robert,"Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly."
Dwight,Very good.
Andy,"Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to ""play ball."" Those were his words."
Oscar,"Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!"
Andy,So make that error!
Oscar,"Andy, no-"
Kevin,Hey! I can make that error.
Oscar,Aw...
Andy,"Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that."
Kevin,"No, I-"
Andy,"It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. What do you say?"
Oscar,I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
Andy,Oh.
Oscar,"Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!"
Andy,What?
Oscar,"It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me."
Andy,You know what? Go. Have fun.
Andy,There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
Jim,Stop right there. I love it.
Darryl,I'm in.
Andy,I didn't even say what it is.
Darryl,It's trivia.
Jim,In Philadelphia.
Andy,"But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase..."
Jim,That's a great idea.
Darryl,That's a great plan.
Andy,Yeah? You like it?
Jim,Yeah.
Andy,All right.
Jim,"All right, good stuff."
Andy,"I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, ""this sounds really stupid."""
Darryl,"You just made a good idea, a great idea."
Andy,There is one problem with this plan.
Darryl,What?
Andy,"We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this."
Gabe,You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right.
Dwight,"Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy."
Gabe,Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question
Dwight,Meat grinder.
Gabe,"Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential."
Dwight,"You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic."
Robert,"Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO."
Dwight,But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
Robert,"No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight."
Gabe,CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
Dwight,Still an important position. Still a chief.
Gabe,"You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking."
Robert,"Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard."
Gabe,Your wish is my command.
Robert,It's a command.
Oscar,"I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?"
Andy,"You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you."
Oscar,What? No!
Andy,I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
Oscar,And you guys thought this was a good idea?
Jim,I thought it was a fun idea.
Darryl,"There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar."
Andy,"Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?"
Oscar,Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
All,No. Nah.
Oscar,What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night?
Andy,It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. Not anything.
Oscar,Good luck.
Andy,"Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves."
Meredith,Good-timers follow me.
Phyllis,Backups.
Stanley,"Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here."
Andy,A-team.
Jim,Okay.
Andy,"All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except..."
Kevin,Okay.
Jim,There's a table over here.
Host,"All right, first question everyone"
Andy,"Oh, we got this!"
Creed,Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
Stanley,Atlanta.
Phyllis,"Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held."
Cathy,My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
Stanley,Keep talking all you want.
Kevin,"How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?"
Erin,"Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness."
Host,"Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. ""Atlanta, Georgia"" is the correct answer."
Gabe,"Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-"
Dwight,There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Gabe,"Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf."
Dwight,"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!"
Receptionist,This must be very frustrating.
Gabe,I can see you in the jungle now.
Host,"Okay, now, you're not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?"
Andy,"Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine."
Jim,Shawn Marion.
Darryl,"Yes, Shawn Marion."
Ryan,"That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington."
Jim,"Wrong, for so many reasons."
Phyllis,"Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?"
Stanley,That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
Kevin,"Ron Artest, Kelly."
Kelly,"No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar."
Host,"All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. ""Lamar Odom"" is what we were looking for. ""Lamar Odom"" Thank you."
Jim,"Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes."
Kevin,Nicely done!
Andy,"You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen."
Darryl,"Chill, man. This plan is airtight."
Dwight,"So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!"
Receptionist,"Well, you got my vote."
Dwight,Oh my God.
Gabe,I know.
Dwight,"Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?"
Gabe,What?
Dwight,What's with the smile?
Gabe,"You're doing great. You know, so good."
Dwight,"And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us."
Gabe,"Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! Ow!"
Dwight,Take me to Robert.
Gabe,Ow! He went home.
Dwight,Take me to his house.
Gabe,"Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing."
Dwight,You know where it is. Lead me there.
Gabe,"Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!"
Dwight,"Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go."
Host,"Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?"
Ryan,Yeah?
Host,"I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account... but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules."
Ryan,"Okay, I'm turning it off."
Host,"Okay, you're not turning it off."
Ryan,I won't look at it.
Host,Sir?
Ryan,I can't- I can't not touch it.
Host,"Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. Thank you."
Ryan,"Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone."
Host,"All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points."
Jim,All right.
Host,D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. Ladies Gaga have five points.
Andy,"So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no."
Dwight,Which one is it?
Gabe,I don't know. All I know is the building.
Dwight,Robert! Robert California! Robert!
Robert,Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
Host,"All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins."
Kevin,Oh yeah!
Kelly,What!
Host,"In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears."
Queerenstein Bears,Whoo! Let's go!
Host,"And, in first place, is Aesop's Foibles."
Oscar's friend,Whoo!
Darryl,"Yeah, we're going to get clobbered."
Host,Ring it in when you know it. First question
Meredith,What?
Erin,What is it?
Meredith,What?
Erin,"I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl."
Host,Aesop's?
Oscar,Salman Rushdie.
Host,"Salman Rushdie is correct. Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what?"
Meredith,"Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-"
Erin,Flying jib.
Host,Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins.
Robert,Shalom. Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.
Stu,Grab my knee!
Gabe,Yay Robert!
Robert,"Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge."
Host,"According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents."
Oscar's friend,Boom! ADHD!
Host,No.
Meredith,Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
Host,That's correct for the Einsteins.
Andy,Whoo! Yeah!
Host,Sir-
Andy,Go Einsteins!
Host,"Dial it back, this isn't Tail Feathers, okay?"
Robert,"They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?"
Dwight,No thank you.
Robert,"Sit down, Dwight."
Dwight,Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle
Robert,You were dining alone? All those people are you?
Dwight,"Yes, exactly. Riddle number two"
Robert,"Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement"
Dwight,N... it's complicated.
Robert,"This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better?"
Dwight,"It's a job interview, not a flea market."
Robert,"Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place."
Dwight,Yes.
Host,Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you're ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.
Andy,"Oh, come on!"
Host,The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight?
Kevin,Three hundred pounds!
Host,"Point for the Einsteins. Here's your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets"
Oscar,Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Oscar's friend,Yes!
Host,"I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins."
Kevin,Les Jolies Choses.
Meredith,Are you sure?
Kevin,Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Host,The Einsteins win it!
Oscar,No! Come on!
Kevin,"Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia"
Stonewall Host,Welcome to the Stonewall Alliance Trivia Championships! First prize is forty-five hundred dollars!
Kevin,"Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home."
Stonewall Host,Riboflavin.
Kevin,Riboflavin?
Stonewall Host,"Michigan. The President of the United States is ""P.O.T.U.S."" John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath."
Dwight,"Oh, ugh. What is this, a meatball? Really?"
Darryl,Cannonball! Let's do this!
Jim,"It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird."
Andy,Wow.
Dwight,"Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the-"
Erin,So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
Stanley,You've been meatballed!
Andy,Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
Dwight,Ugh.
Erin,The Bernard family seal. Duh.
Stanley,Are you ready for some meatball?
Andy,Duh.
Dwight,"Aw, man. This is not very clever, Jim."
Erin,Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Jim,I know.
Andy,"Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night."
Stanley,Look for your stapler!
Erin,"Oh, you weren't going to do that?"
Dwight,Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Andy,"Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you."
Stanley,Oh okay. Good night. What's the haul?
Erin,"Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused."
Dwight,Thirty-two meatballs.
Robert,"And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness."
Stanley,Good day.
Jim,To madness.
Dwight,That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Ryan,To madness.
Stanley,We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
Toby,To madness.
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear."
Meredith,To madness.
Erin,"I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine."
Jim,"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?"
Erin,I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Meredith,"Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl."
Andy,Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
Jim,Are you serious?
Andy,"My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but..."
Ryan,"Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man."
Jim,"Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though."
Gabe,And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
Oscar,"Oh, who needs a house that size?"
Oscar,"Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!"
Dwight,Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
Toby,And I am Bacchus's friend!
Robert,"I'm selling the house, actually."
Robert,"Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party."
Jim,"You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent."
All,Yes! Woohoo! Bravo!
Robert,"It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, s*x, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?"
Jim,And there's my talking point.
Jim,"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke."
Robert,"Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going."
Robert,What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
Ryan,"Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave."
Jim,"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing."
Gabe,So leave.
Robert,"Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it."
Andy,"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here."
Robert,A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.
Andy,"Well, please tell Susan we all say hi."
Kevin,"Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool?"
Oscar,"Kevin, no."
Robert,"What, as some sort of last hoorah?"
Kevin,"Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it."
Robert,You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this
Kevin,"Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?"
Oscar,"That was you, Kevin."
Kevin,It was me.
Meredith,"You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift."
Erin,"Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever."
Meredith,It's no problem. You live right near me.
Erin,How do you know where I live?
Meredith,Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Erin,Why?
Meredith,He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
Erin,Oh. Come on.
Erin,Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.
Angela,"Oh, it is warm."
Cathy,It's almost too warm.
Gabe,"I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half."
Ryan,"Oh, so close. Eighty-one."
Gabe,"Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret."
Cathy,"Hey, late guy."
Jim,Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
Andy,Oh.
Jim,DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Jim,"You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine."
Jim,"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way."
Robert,You should see the whole thing.
Jim,"I bet I should. That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you."
Robert,I'm just about to give the tour.
Jim,All right-
Robert,Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.
Jim,I must...
Jessica,Wow.
Andy,"Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage."
Jessica,What are you doing?
Andy,Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener.
Jessica,Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Andy,"No, I'm good."
Erin,Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
Andy,Hi.
Erin,How is everything? How's your car?
Andy,It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
Erin,Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Andy,"Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes."
Erin,"Oh, like a goodbye trip."
Andy,No. What?
Jessica,Hey.
Erin,Hi.
Erin,"I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him."
Darryl,Val. You made it.
Val,"Yup, yup."
Darryl,"Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?"
Val,"You know, you are just as dumb at night."
Darryl,Mmm.
Andy,"All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath."
Jessica,"No, show me."
Andy,Okay.
Jessica,Dive in right here.
Andy,In a minute. In a minute.
Jessica,Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
Andy,A minute would be cool.
Erin,"Hey, Dwight Snoot."
Dwight,What-
Erin,What you doing?
Dwight,I'm relaxing. Scram.
Erin,Ow.
Andy,"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?"
Stanley,I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
Andy,Where...
Erin,"Come on, don't you want to play?"
Dwight,Oh really?
Erin,Yeah.
Dwight,"Yeah, you want to play you little hick?"
Kevin,Whoa.
Angela,Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
Robert,"Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a pen1s, a v*g1n*, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio."
Oscar,Holy cow!
Robert,Wine collection.
Oscar,How many bottles? Three hundred?
Robert,"About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers."
Oscar,Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
Toby,"Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau."
Ryan,"Robert, you are too kind."
Robert,Oh.
Gabe,Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.
Ryan,"With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me."
Gabe,And Gabe-y makes three.
Jim,"Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical."
Robert,"Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it."
Jim,Really? Why?
Robert,I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.
Erin,Oh!
Dwight,"You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?"
Erin,"Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous."
Dwight,I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it.
Erin,Oh Dwight!
Erin,Stop.
Dwight,You stop.
Erin,"No, you stop."
Dwight,"No, you stop."
Erin,Is he looking? Oh. You can stop.
Dwight,"Okay, you can stop."
Erin,"No, no, no, he's not looking."
Dwight,"No, you can stop."
Erin,You can actually stop.
Kelly,"Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?"
Meredith,The main stone's missing.
Kelly,I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
Robert,"I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan."
Jim,Good night.
Oscar,To the kitchen!
All,To the kitchen!
Robert,To the kitchen. Onward!
Oscar,"Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?"
Toby,Note? It's a symphony.
Oscar,"Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club."
Toby,I would love that.
Toby,"Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?"
Darryl,"You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it."
Meredith,"You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice."
Val,You in?
Darryl,"Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in."
Darryl,"I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage."
Dwight,"Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah..."
Erin,Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
Dwight,Damn it.
Erin,What is the most romantic possible thing?
Dwight,We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Erin,"Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you."
Both,Yes!
Angela,You're in my way!
Erin,"Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all."
Dwight,Chicken fight!
Andy,No thanks.
Erin,Dang it! What the heck already?
Dwight,"Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!"
Cathy,"Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?"
Kevin,"I'm right here! Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath."
Dwight,Yeah- oh!
Erin,Yes! Woo!
Dwight,Woohoo! Yes!
Erin,"Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together."
Dwight,I know. I could just bang you right now.
Erin,He's not looking. Hey!
Robert,I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
Jim,To both these bears.
Ryan,To both these bears.
Toby,Bears.
Oscar,To both these bears.
Robert,"When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies"
Ryan,"I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema."
Gabe,Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Andy,"Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found."
Kelly,"Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it."
Andy,I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
Kelly,Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
Andy,"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?"
Phyllis,"Oh, I don't think you're being silly."
Kelly,Oh God.
Andy,"You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund."
Phyllis,Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
Jessica,Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
Val,How was that?
Kevin,Okay. Watch my toes.
Darryl,Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Val,"No, I'm good. Thank you."
Darryl,Cool.
Val,Cool. Does Darryl not swim?
Kevin,"That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim."
Jessica,Yes!
Andy,Yeah!
Dwight,Maybe we should take a little break.
Erin,"Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what."
Dwight,Okay.
Erin,One more?
Andy,Yeah!
Jessica,Yeah! Great!
Erin,"Mush, mush, mush! Come on!"
Dwight,Go!
Erin,Go! Okay. Yeah.
Jessica,Here we go! Yes!
Andy,Yay! Whoa!
Kevin,Wow!
Andy,I cannot believe you're still up!
Jessica,I cannot believe it either.
Erin,I've got this! Charge! Go! Go!
Andy,"Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-"
Dwight,"Erin, did we win?"
Erin,Sure. Sure we did.
Dwight,You're lying. We didn't win.
Erin,"Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest."
Kelly,"You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it."
Angela,We're in the pool!
Meredith,"Shut it, Angela."
Dwight,"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday."
Andy,"Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday."
Dwight,"I know. But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation."
Andy,Mmm.
Dwight,"So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin."
Andy,"Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me."
Dwight,Not what I asked.
Andy,We're done. Erin and I are over.
Dwight,"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With s*x."
Andy,Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
Dwight,You're an idiot.
Kevin,"Kelly, that is mine! This is mine!"
Erin,Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Kevin,No!
Val,Oh I've got him!
Andy,"Val, I need the space."
Pam,"No, she brought you drawings."
Val,"All right guys, clear out."
Jim,"Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy."
Andy,Everybody out.
Andy,Oh!
Val,Promise me you're going to clean up.
Jim,"Oh, Aunt Phyllis."
Andy,I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
Phyllis,Oh.
Val,Promise me that-
Andy,"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?"
Andy,Obviously I'm going to clean up.
Cece,No.
Andy,"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, ""Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,"" and then you have to be like, ""Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!"" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. s*x also works."
Pam,"She says ""no"" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is ""No."" Cece, do you want some broccoli?"
Erin,Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
Cece,Yes.
Andy,Hey! Tuna! He's back.
Pam,No. It's crazy.
Jim,Hey.
Ryan,Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
Andy,"Oh, look at this. Tuna wrap."
Andy,There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Jim,Okay.
Kelly,"Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?"
Andy,Hand roll.
Cece,No.
Jim,Yeah.
Kelly,So then this means nothing to you.
Phyllis,How was jury duty?
Andy,"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?"
Jim,"It was pretty uneventful, actually."
Jim,"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?"
Dwight,Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Cece,Mama!
Erin,What was the case?
Pam,Shh.
Jim,"Uh, hit and run."
Jim,I don't know what else we can do here.
Erin,"Ooh, ""the case of the hit and run,"" that's exciting."
Cece,"Mama, mama, mama."
Phyllis,Did you send him to the slammer?
Jim,It's okay.
Jim,Nope. Not guilty.
Pam,"Oh, it's okay, sweetie."
Dwight,"Of course you found him not guilty. ""Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."""
Jim,"All right, all right. Okay."
Jim,"We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come."
Pam,"It's okay, honey. It's okay, it's okay."
Dwight,"Not coming, have plans."
Jim,"All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this."
Jim,Okay.
Pam,Shh.
Jim,"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened."
Cece,Mama!
Erin,Ah! Angela had the baby!
Dwight,"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me."
Kevin,Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
Angela,Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
Darryl,Why?
Dwight,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Kevin,You know.
Angela,That is completely untrue.
Darryl,Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
Dwight,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
Kevin,"A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up."
Dwight,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
Ryan,"Eh, a little bit."
Angela,I did not. Uh-uh.
Kevin,"Oh, did I win the pool?"
Dwight,"-and I said, ""I bet I could fulfill you,"" and you said, ""I'd like to see you try,"" and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls."
Erin,"Ah, no. Right month, wrong year."
Angela,That didn't happen.
Oscar,Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Dwight,And then I inserted my penis-
Erin,We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Angela,No! Stop it!
Phyllis,"Oh, I'd love to but, um-"
Dwight,Into your-
Jim,"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work."
Angela,Dwight.
Oscar,"Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family."
Dwight,v*g1n* and-
Kevin,"Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom."
Angela,"And even if it did, it's just a coincidence."
Gabe,"Everyone, our very own Angela-"
Dwight,Admit that there is a chance.
Oscar,"We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit."
Angela,I will not.
Gabe,"Oh, I am so in."
Dwight,Admit it. Admit it.
Gabe,I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
Angela,"I will not, it's not-"
Andy,"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?"
Senator Lipton,All done?
Jim,"Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-"
Dwight,Yeah.
Meredith,How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Senator Lipton,Mmm.
Stanley,"Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles."
Angela,"Yes, yes. He's sleeping."
Phyllis,"Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change."
Dwight,"Before I go, may I?"
Jim,"Wow, I'm really sorry."
Angela,"Sure. Watch the head, watch the head."
Phyllis,Yeah.
Dwight,"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision."
Jim,I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
Nurse,Who are you?
Jim,"So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually."
Dwight,I just might be his father.
Toby,"You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's."
Nurse,I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him.
Jim,"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too."
Jim,"I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?"
Toby,You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
Cece,No!
Meredith,"Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas."
Jim,"Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?"
Dwight,"I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants."
Pam,"I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier."
Oscar,"Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive."
Jim,Cece!
Kevin,"Got that, bimbo?"
Pam,"Okay, we're going."
Erin,"Got it, bimbo."
Jim,"Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud."
Angela,Yes?
Pam,"Shh, shh, shh."
Oscar,"Knock, knock. Oh!"
Jim,"I know, I know."
Kevin,Hi!
Pam,You want to grab her?
Angela,Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
Jim,"I'm gonna grab her, okay."
Oscar,We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Pam,"Here we go, here we go."
Senator Lipton,"Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton."
Jim,"Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up."
Kevin,Phillip is so fat.
Stanley,We'll see you tomorrow.
Oscar,Kevin!
Jim,"No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back."
Kevin,"You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby."
Phyllis,"No, just go home."
Angela,Hey.
Darryl,"It's all good, we got this."
Senator Lipton,"Yes, he's substantial."
Darryl,"I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation."
Erin,He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
Pam,Jim.
Dwight,"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop..."
Phyllis,Just go.
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Andy,"Hey, we'll be just fine."
Dwight,And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Jim,"Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go."
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Andy,"Oh, whew!"
Dwight,"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. Busted, Halpert!"
Andy,"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here."
Jim,"Okay, wait, wait."
Dwight,"Oh, right. The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe."
Dwight,"Yes! Andy, get out here."
Gabe,You had something important to tell me?
Jim,No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Dwight,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant."
Dwight,I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Dwight,"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?"
Andy,"What's up, gangstas?"
Dwight,Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Andy,"Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory."
Dwight,I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
Andy,"No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill."
Dwight,I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Andy,"Here, right there. Down the hatch."
Dwight,I really don't want to take the chill pill.
Andy,"Attaboy. Good. Now, chill."
Dwight,"Okay, okay. But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?"
Andy,"Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu."
Dwight,That's good enough for me.
Jim,"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you."
Andy,I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
Jim,Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Andy,"No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?"
Jim,No.
Andy,Do you know why you never heard of it?
Jim,No.
Andy,Covered it up.
Jim,Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Andy,They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
Andy,"My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt."
Ernesto,Where you want I park?
Dwight,"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you."
Toby,Ernesto!
Ernesto,Hola Toby!
Toby,"Yeah, hey."
Ernesto,Como esta?
Nate,"Uh, I'm going to say ""I"" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of ""he says blah, blah, blah,"" I'm going to say ""I say, blah, blah, blah,"" but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, ""He remembers Toby."" ""I remember Toby."""
Dwight,"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?"
Jim,Uh-
Toby,It's the empanada guy.
Jim,The empanada guy!
Dwight,"No, Toby! Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. Ask him if he remembers Jim."
Ernesto,No.
Nate,"He says, ""No."""
Dwight,"He says, ""No!"" Boom!"
Andy,"Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients."
Dwight,"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world."
Nate,"Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets."
Jim,"Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them."
Creed,"Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink."
Dwight,"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?"
Andy,Why? Everybody's heard it.
Dwight,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Andy,"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there."
Phyllis,Why?
Andy,Why? Why?
Jim,Because my car broke down.
Andy,"His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse."
Dwight,"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?"
Andy,"Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that."
Phyllis,"I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?"
Andy,We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
Jim,"Well, I think you handled it pretty well."
Andy,"I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your."
Jim,"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth."
Andy,I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
Oscar,"Wow, it's so... healthy."
Kevin,I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
Angela,"No, you will not."
Erin,Is he really five pounds?
Angela,Mm-hmm.
Erin,"Because I squat with five pounds. This- yeah, this feels like more than that."
Senator Lipton,"No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces."
Angela,"Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?"
Oscar,"Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-"
Senator Lipton,"Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park."
Angela,"Aw, preemie pajamas!"
Oscar,"Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-"
Angela,"No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you."
Kevin,I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
Oscar,This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
Jim,"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off."
Stanley,What?
Jim,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Dwight,"You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening."
Stanley,"What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt."
Jim,"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good."
Dwight,Your clients. They're all mine.
Darryl,"Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse."
Andy,"Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die."
Dwight,"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself."
Andy,"Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim."
Dwight,"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-"
Andy,"I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye."
Dwight,That's it? This is crap!
Gabe,"You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao."
Dwight,"Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP."
Dwight,"I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best"
Angela,Shh.
Oscar,"Honestly, I can return this for a larger size."
Angela,"It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio."
Oscar,The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Angela,Ah!
Kevin,Little Kevin.
Angela,Really?
Oscar,Angela.
Angela,"Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago."
Oscar,"I knew that, I knew it."
Angela,"The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata."
Oscar,Chicken marsala.
Angela,"Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock."
Oscar,Mm-hmm.
Angela,"And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious."
Oscar,Dwight. Hey.
Dwight,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?"
Oscar,"He went to the car or something, but he'll be back."
Dwight,Okay.
Oscar,Don't you want to see the baby?
Dwight,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
Oscar,I promised I wouldn't tell.
Dwight,So don't.
Oscar,Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
Dwight,What?
Oscar,She got pregnant before the wedding.
Dwight,How long before?
Oscar,A month. You didn't hear it from me!
Dwight,Yes I did.
Angela,Dwight?
Senator Lipton,Dwight.
Dwight,I want to see the baby.
Erin,"Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it."
Dwight,"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... willingly, or as slaves."
Dwight,"That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose s*x, that baby is mine."
Angela,He's hungry.
Senator Lipton,"Oh, that's my cue to leave."
Angela,"No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover."
Senator Lipton,Still. Still.
Angela,You won't see-
Jim,You want a giraffe?
Jim,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam."
Pam,"Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here."
Jim,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face."
Pam,"Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!"
Jim,"Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think."
Pam,"Oh, hi Stanley."
Jim,Split the difference?
Pam,Jim.
Jim,"Okay, let's go."
Pam,Hey.
Erin,Hi.
Pam,Hi everybody!
Jim,What?
All,Hi.
Pam,How about a little visit?
Jim,"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers."
Creed,"Hey, Angela's back with her baby."
Pam,"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip."
Andy,"Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does."
Creed,Let me have a turn.
Pam,"No, it's the pacifier's turn."
Creed,All right.
Jim,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Pam,"Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat."
Phyllis,Cookies?
Pam,"No, but that would've been a really good idea."
Jim,That was a great idea.
Jim,Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
Jim,Mosquito.
Pam,Hey guys!
Dwight,Orientation is over.
All,Hey.
Nate,"Oh Darryl, hey."
Pam,Hi.
Darryl,Hey what's up? You called?
Andy,Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Nate,"Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything..."
Phyllis,Are you glad to be back?
Darryl,It's cool really.
Pam,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three."
Nate,"No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes."
Stanley,You still had eight weeks more than we did.
Darryl,"""This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack"""
Pam,"Well, it's not exactly a vacation."
Nate,"Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you."
Angela,Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
Darryl,Thanks. Nice flowers.
Dwight,What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Val,"Thanks, they're from my mom."
Angela,I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.
Darryl,Your mom?
Pam,What?!
Val,Yeah.
Kelly,Damn girl! Your body!
Darryl,Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
Oscar,"Angela, you look amazing."
Val,"Yeah, that's her."
Angela,"Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars."
Darryl,"She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?"
Group,
Val,"Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon."
Pam,"Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?"
Darryl,Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
Kevin,"Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it."
Dwight,"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene."
Pam,Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
Erin,I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
Angela,"I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here."
Dwight,So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Pam,When did you find time to do all this?
Jim,"So, what is this special project?"
Angela,"Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?"
Dwight,Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
Pam,Thank you. Oh my gosh. It's really good.
Jim,That sounds awesome.
Angela,"I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh."
Dwight,"It did, it did."
Pam,"So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-"
Ryan,You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Jim,Nope. It's over.
Erin,"Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. Oh, don't write it down unless you like it."
Pam,...we wanted to say thank you-
Dwight,"Oh, I like it."
Jim,Nope. OK.
Ryan,It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is
Andy,"Dwight, I have exciting news for you."
Dwight,No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Dwight,What?
Ryan,"Right. Think different, from Apple."
Andy,I think you're going to like it.
Jim,"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?"
Dwight,You can't tantalize me.
Dwight,Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Andy,"Oooh, maybe I can. I got an email... from corporate....that told me that..."
Dwight,"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag."
Dwight,OK.
Kelly,I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
Andy,That... you got a promotion! Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
Ryan,"Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there."
Dwight,"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear."
Kelly,"Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you."
Andy,"No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores."
Ryan,"No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair."
Dwight,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!"
Pam,Alright
Dwight,The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly
Jim,Bye.
Erin,And here's the fax for you.
Pam,Bye. Call me when you land.
Andy,And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
Jim,I will.
Erin,Ah! Love to learn.
Andy,Safe travels.
Andy,"Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one."
Erin,Goodbye for a very very long time.
Erin,So...
Andy,"Oh, K. It's only three weeks."
Andy,"Uh yeah, look at that."
Kathy,"All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?"
Erin,We're pin twins.
Andy,"Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later."
Erin,Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.
Erin,"For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica."
Darryl,What do we have here?
Darryl,"Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ""we're just friends"" beanie or a ""I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'"" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie."
Dwight,"Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks."
Pam,Really?
Dwight,Mm hm.
Pam,I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
Jim,"Ooh, me three."
Dwight,"Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill."
Pam,Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
Dwight,"God, you're such a spy."
Darryl,Notice anything different about me?
Val,You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
Darryl,Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
Nate,"I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat."
Darryl,Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
Val,"I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?"
Darryl,"Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here."
Nate,What?
Darryl,Yeah.
Nate,"Darryl, you shouldn't have."
Darryl,Hey.
Nate,Can I open it?
Darryl,"No, no, no. Maybe just later."
Nate,"Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. Darryl."
Val,Wow. Those are really nice.
Nate,They're so elegant.
Val,Cashmere.
Nate,How'd you know?
Darryl,Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
Val,Can't wait.
Nate,"""I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day."" Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves."
Dwight,"My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?"
Kathy,Kathy.
Dwight,Kathy.
Jim,"I just got a text from Robert California that says ""bring your clubs to Florida""."
Pam,Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
Jim,I hope not. Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Pam,"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one."
Andy,"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?"
Dwight,Yes.
Andy,Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
Dwight,Oh my god.
Andy,"They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find."
Dwight,Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
Andy,"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin."
Dwight,Oh god.
Andy,You have your team.
Dwight,Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
Pam,"Well, let's hear it."
Jim,"""Robert, Hey!"" Exclamation point."
Pam,I like it so far.
Jim,"""Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA"" Dash JH."
Pam,"It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida."
Jim,"Yeah, it's a golf text."
Pam,Total golf text. Send it.
Jim,Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
Kelly,"You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh."
Darryl,This is Darryl.
Bob,"Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers."
Darryl,Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
Bob,"Yeah, do you know her?"
Darryl,We're friends. We're friends.
Bob,"Cool. Um, so can I get that address or...?"
Darryl,"Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen."
Bob,Why do you need a pen?
Darryl,Back off! I got my reasons.
Dwight,"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?"
Kelly,Why?
Dwight,"Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida."
Kelly,Hell yeah.
Stanley,What?!
Dwight,"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you."
Meredith,"Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back."
Oscar,It just feels like a slap in the face.
Dwight,"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons."
Oscar,We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
Dwight,"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime."
Kevin,"Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape."
Dwight,"Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan."
Ryan,What are the criteria for going?
Dwight,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you."
Andy,Mooshie mooshie.
Dwight,"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?"
Andy,Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
Stanley,Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
Kevin,Hey!
Angela,"Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office."
Kelly,Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Angela,My baby is not a monster!
Dwight,Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Andy,"Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!"
Ryan,"Stop calling us ""guys""."
Andy,"I use the word ""guys"" a lot when I'm nervous...guys."
Andy,Guys! Guys! Guys!
Group,Stop it!
Andy,Guys..
Ryan,Stop. Stop it Andy.
Oscar,...Andy.
Andy,Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
Dwight,OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
Andy,Wha-
Stanley,"If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice."
Andy,"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out."
Dwight,"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it."
Andy,No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
Kelly,For you maybe.
Andy,Five to six hours?
Dwight,Three to four hours.
Andy,No no no no.
Dwight,Two to three hours...
Andy,Nope.
Dwight,Come up with a statement in the next hour....
Andy,Thirty minutes!
Creed,I'm out.
Pam,"Ok, read it back to me."
Jim,"Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets."
Pam,Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
Erin,Absolutely. Works for me.
Jim,"Ok, sending."
Pam,Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
Jim,Really did He responded L-O-L.
Erin,
Phyllis,I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Meredith,I am...
Dwight,I have already picked my team
Ryan,"You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there."
Andy,Or both?
Ryan,"Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks."
Andy,Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
Dwight,"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat."
Kevin,"Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something..."
Dwight,"Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know."
Andy,Thank you.
Kevin,When do we leave?
Andy,Thank you.
Toby,"It has been a long, lonely winter."
Dwight,"Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA"
Toby,"It is real, thank you for saying that."
Andy,"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?"
Stanley,Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
Dwight,Maybe it's what she does here...
Andy,Well...
Erin,"Hey guys, any spots left?"
Andy,"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?"
Erin,I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Dwight,You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Erin,"Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go."
Andy,Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
Erin,"Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good."
Jim,"Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?"
Pam,I think you need to go to Florida.
Jim,I think you're right.
Pam,"It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.."
Jim,Total nightmare.
Pam,I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
Jim,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone."
Pam,Exactly.
Dwight,"Well, No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?"
Andy,"Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go."
Dwight,I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Jim,"You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go."
Dwight,Jim is essential to th-
Jim,"Hold on, just wanna get it on camera."
Dwight,"Andy, Jim is just too...essen-..."
Jim,Essential.
Dwight,This is stupid! Cut.
Jim,"Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks."
Dwight,He doesn't even want to go.
Jim,"Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates."
Dwight,Oh my god.
Jim,"Hey, quick question"
Andy,"OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida"
Dwight,What?
Andy,....Stanley..
Dwight,No.
Andy,...Ryan...
Dwight,No!
Andy,...Erin...
Dwight,(Bleep)
Andy,"...And, Jim."
Dwight,"You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!"
Dwight,"Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move."
Stanley,Why is it so hot in here?
Dwight,"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead."
Ryan,But...
Dwight,"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?"
Ryan,"No no, I want to go."
Dwight,"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell."
Jim,Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Dwight,"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it."
Dwight,How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
Stanley,How did a mosquito get in here?
Dwight,"I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes."
Dwight,"Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ""I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt"" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, oh. What was that?"
Dwight,"Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late."
Erin,I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
Dwight,Wake up!
Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?"
Erin,Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Dwight,"Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!"
Erin,"Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day!"
Stanley,Mmm! Ugh!
Dwight,Good morning.
Erin,"Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now."
Ryan,"Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. Oh, not cool!"
Jim,"I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-"
Dwight,Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? Oh man.
Erin,What do you think happened?
Dwight,"Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh."
Jim,Puppet.
Cathy,"Cool, for your kids?"
Jim,Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Dwight,"Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan."
Dwight,"I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her."
Dwight,"I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel."
Saleswoman,What does he like?
Dwight,Power.
Ryan,"Okay, and this one is, ""Huh. Don't see too many museums around here."""
Dwight,"Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car."
Erin,"Hey, are you okay?"
Dwight,"I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming."
Erin,Who says none of us are diarrheal?
Jim,Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
Dwight,"Very funny, Jim."
Jim,"Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, ""For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?"" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?"
Dwight,I'm gonna set your face on fire.
Jim,"That's a good one. Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?"
Stanley,"Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod."
Jim,Yes.
Stanley,"You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins."
Jim,Loggins and Messina.
Stanley,"Did I say ""Messina?"""
Andy,Ahh! Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
Creed,"I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today."
Andy,"It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... I thought that would be cooler."
Darryl,I loved it.
Meredith,"Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet."
Andy,"Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it."
Oscar,Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Andy,"Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. In the trash."
Pam,"Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail."
Everyone,Oh great.
Kelly,We're screwed.
Pam,There.
Andy,Oh! There we go! Pam?
Pam,Yeah?
Andy,Can you get the phone?
Pam,Well I'm not the receptionist.
Andy,"Mm, well, you used to be."
Pam,"I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do."
Andy,Phone's ringing.
Kelly,Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Everyone,Somebody! Answer the phone.
Kelly,"Andy, pick up the phone!"
Stanley,Get the damn phone.
Meredith,You're the closest one to it.
Andy,"Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?"
Jim,Man.
Cathy,How was the drive?
Jim,Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
Stanley,"Life is short. ""Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse."" That's one of my mottoes."
Jim,I would love to hear the other mottos.
Packer,"Quick query, Halpert."
Jim,No way.
Packer,Still queer?
Dwight,Packer.
Packer,You can't put me down. Too strong!
Packer,"Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-"
Nellie,"Psst. Say, ""So who's leading this thing, anyway?"""
Ryan,"So who's leading this thing, anyway?"
Nellie,"Psst. Say, ""I can't wait to meet him."""
Ryan,I can't wait to meet him.
Nellie,"Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?"
Ryan,I-
Nellie,"You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping pen1s? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping pen1s is right here, and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my pen1s. I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. After you decided I wasn't ""a good fit-"""
Jim,It was-
Nellie,"Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, ""Yes!"" So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?"
Cathy,"Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one."
Nellie,"No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic."
Cathy,Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
Nellie,"Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it."
Erin,Yeah!
Nellie,Let me just get the projector working.
Dwight,Uh.
Jim,You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Dwight,"You didn't poison me, it's just stress."
Jim,Okay.
Dwight,What is the antidote?
Jim,True love's kiss.
Nellie,"Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon."
Dwight,"I'll do it! I always say, ""You want something done right? Ask Dwight."" Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head."
Packer,I can do it.
Dwight,Mmm! There we go.
Dwight,"Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. What kind of poison did you use?"
Jim,"Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding."
Dwight,"Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed."
Nellie,Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me.
Emergency Operator,"Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?"
Dwight,"Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot."
Packer,"I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time."
Nellie,Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.
Packer,"Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense."
Dwight,You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
Packer,"Did you say ""masturbator?"""
Dwight,"I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter."
Nellie,Why are you sitting down like that?
Dwight,"Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!"
Jim,Wow. Are you that bored?
Stanley,"It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate."
Jim,Is that another motto?
Stanley,It's whatever you want.
Jim,Mmm.
Stanley,Or do you only drink with your kids?
Jim,"Ah, let's do it. Oh, that's healthy."
Jim,"I've spent so much of my life telling myself ""Please, don't end up like Stanley,"" and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes."
Nellie,"We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?"
Packer,"Yup. Tallahassee, let's go."
Erin,"Jim, are you in?"
Jim,"Oh, I don't know."
Stanley,Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
Jim,"All right, what the heck? Let's do it."
Packer,This is great. This is gonna be great.
Nellie,I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
Dwight,I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
Ryan,"Dude, I think you have appendicitis."
Dwight,Ahh!
Ryan,Dwight?
Jim,"Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?"
Dwight,"Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!"
Packer,"Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen."
Dwight,Stop moving!
Jim,No one's moving!
Dwight,Oh!
Everyone,"Oh, oh!"
Dwight,Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
Jim,"Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning."
Jim,"The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty."
Paramedic,You need an operation. You have appendicitis.
Ryan,Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
Erin,How long will he be gone?
Paramedic,Two or three days.
Dwight,Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Packer,"Drama queen, am I right?"
Dwight,"Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up."
Packer,That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
Pam,"Whoa, are those mini pizzas?"
Andy,"Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck."
Kevin,"Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge."
Andy,"Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through."
Darryl,Oh yeah.
Andy,Up high.
Darryl,Yes sir. Thanks.
Andy,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put out some new magazines, check it out."
Creed,"Ah, Dwell."
Andy,"I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. Oh, there's the phone!"
Dwight,I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Erin,"Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later."
Dwight,Who's doing the presentations?
Erin,"Packer's giving one. Jim'll probably give ours, I guess."
Dwight,Damn it!
Erin,"Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-"
Packer,#NAME?
Nellie,Very good point.
Dwight,"Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting."
Nellie,"Dwight, are you all right?"
Dwight,I'm great. How are you?
Dwight,What's our presentation about?
Jim,"Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours."
Dwight,"I got the surgery, what else is there to do?"
Erin,Do a hundred jumping jacks.
Dwight,"No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks."
Erin,I don't feel like it either!
Erin,"Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-"
Dwight,I want that vice-presidency.
Jim,You haven't done any of the research.
Dwight,"""You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name."" You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it."
Stanley,"Aw, let him do it."
Jim,"Stanley, are you listening to music?"
Stanley,Yup.
Dwight,"All right, who's ready for the next presentation?"
Nellie,"Ah, what is your topic?"
Dwight,"What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is."
Erin,Retail consumer habits.
Dwight,"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay."
Dwight,Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
Ryan,I can field this one.
Dwight,"No, sit down. ""Seasonal."" Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God. Next slide."
Andy,"Mail call! His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt."
Kevin,Are those the lyrics?
Dwight,Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Nellie,What are the three pillars of retail?
Erin,Convenience.
Dwight,Ingredients.
Erin,Service.
Dwight,Burgers.
Erin,Building loyalty.
Dwight,"Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one"
Nellie,"Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight."
Dwight,Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
Jim,You are bleeding through your shirt.
Dwight,Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. Ah.
Pam,"Hey, having fun?"
Andy,"Yes I am, as a matter of fact."
Pam,"Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?"
Andy,I found my calling.
Darryl,"Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog."
Pam,"Guys, I don't like this analogy."
Andy,Ugh! Fine. Did you see this?
Pam,It's nice.
Andy,I mean...
Nellie,How are you feeling?
Dwight,"Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle."
Nellie,Can I see the wound?
Dwight,Oh God.
Nellie,Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
Dwight,"You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass."
Nellie,"A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet."
Dwight,That's right.
Nellie,"That is amazing. Todd, look at that."
Packer,"Oh, yikes. Incoming-"
Dwight,Ah! Not so fast.
Nellie,Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you have a lot to offer.
Packer,"It would be an honor, ma'am."
Dwight,I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Dwight,"I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix."
Andy,"Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew."
Donna Muraski,Hi Andrew. What happened to Erin?
Andy,"Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks."
Donna Muraski,"Oh, good for her. She's such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna Muraski misses her."
Andy,I miss her too.
Nellie,"Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies."
Wally Amos,"Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you're all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. Well, back when I was regular Amos-"
Stanley,What's under the cloth?
Wally Amos,We'll get to that.
Packer,Cookies. Bet you anything it's cookies.
Wally Amos,It's cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first.
Nellie,"Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies!"
Erin,"Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-"
Wally Amos,Is it oatmeal with no raisins?
Pam,"Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?"
Dwight,We wait. Come to papa.
Angela,So cute.
Jim,Oh.
Oscar,"Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do."
Pam,Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Jim,"I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again."
Angela,"News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid."
Dwight,"Nope, I wasn't bitten."
Pam,"Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course."
Jim,"Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here."
Angela,That is where we disagree.
Dwight,"Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect."
Oscar,"Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?"
Jim,Come on.
Pam,"No, three-month-old humans don't do that."
Dwight,"If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me."
Angela,My Phillip is crawling.
Jim,You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Pam,Angela is such a liar!
Dwight,"No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long."
Oscar,It's maddening!
Jim,"Okay, they're fine. They're adults."
Oscar,"Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long."
Dwight,"No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first."
Pam,"Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again."
Jim,Is that really how you want to get this job?
Angela,"No one said ""you must have two"""
Dwight,Such a chorus girl.
Oscar,"Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no."
Jim,"Okay, Dwight... Dwight... Dwight, Dwight Dwight!... uh..."
Angela,No thank you.
Cathy,Is crazy gone?
Andy,Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat...am i right?
Angela/Pam,Unbelievable!
Oscar,Un-be-liev-a-ble.
Nellie,Oh!
Nellie,"It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?"
Gabe,They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Packer,That's great.
Dwight,"Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey."
Dwight,Pretty good.
Cathy,"Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster... Okay, cool. Thanks... I know, I'm a pig, right?"
Nellie,"Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP."
Jim,Hmm? No.
Dwight,"That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP."
Cathy,"Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously."
Nellie,"I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more."
Jim,"Okay alright. I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married."
Dwight,"Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-"
Cathy,"Oh my God, what are you thinking?"
Jim,Catching butterflies.
Jim,um... I mean-
Dwight,"That's a hobby, unless it's for food."
Cathy,"I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?"
Jim,Theater.
Jim,"I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching."
Dwight,Waste of time.
Cathy,Can you... without running to the other side of the room all night?
Jim,Dragging.
Jim,"Yes, I can. uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care."
Dwight,That's just a verb.
Cathy,Okay. I am so cold.
Jim,Dragging sticks.
Jim,
Dwight,"Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks."
Pam,"Hey, Darryl. You okay?"
Nellie,"Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just... you three, no."
Darryl,She's got a boyfriend.
Packer,Not good enough (clicks tongue)
Andy,"Play it cool, man. She'll come around."
Dwight,"English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. You're crap. You're wonderful. They're mean, but they're incisive."
Pam,"No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there."
Nellie,Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7
Andy,"Yeah, but... My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool."
Packer,I'll be there at 6
Pam,My husband would tell you to go for it.
Cathy,"Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about."
Ryan,Hey.
Jim,"'Talla-nasty', very clever."
Erin,Hey.
Cathy,Thank you-
Ryan,Hey.
Gabe,"Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' no, no, no, no..."
Erin,Hey.
Jim,"Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon."
Ryan,"Hey, this is fun."
Stanley,"My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail?. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?"
Erin,A lot of fun.
Andy,"Okay, everybody. 5"
Ryan,"I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day."
Pam,"Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!"
Erin,You should move down here with me.
Andy,Say what?
Ryan,Yeah?
Pam,We are good to goooo!
Erin,We could be roommates.
Andy,Say what?
Ryan,Really?
Pam,We're good to goooo!
Erin,"We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-"
Angela,Stop it.
Ryan,Yeah.
Andy,Say-
Erin,Maybe in six months-
Angela,Stop it.
Ryan,"Six months?... um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly."
Oscar,Andy.
Nellie,"Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts."
Andy,Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Dwight,"Okay... Seven, one, one, nine..."
Pam,"Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball."
Nellie,"No, no, no, not numbers, no."
Andy,"...ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor."
Dwight,"No, okay."
Packer,Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
Nellie,No.
Nellie,Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Dwight,"Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?"
Dwight,Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ... What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Nellie,"Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time."
Packer,"Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips."
Dwight,"Wait, the numbers!"
Dwight,"That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback."
Nellie,Mm-hmm.
Gabe,What happens if you're the hunchback?
Dwight,oh...
Dwight,"Oh, you get kicked."
Nellie,mm-hmm...
Jim,How many buttons do you have?
Dwight,There you go.
Dwight,(takes out bag) 40. Always.
Nellie,I will see you in seven-
Cathy,Can I see?
Dwight,"Seven minutes.... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card.."
Dwight,Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
Dwight,"Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past."
Cathy,"So, I get to kick you now."
Angela,"1434-967, paid."
Dwight,"No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you."
Darryl,It has been processed.
Cathy,"Well, that's how I played it in college."
Val,It has been delivered.
Jim,College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Pam,"That's it, last one."
Dwight,Aah!
Packer,Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Kelly,Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Nellie,"Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit."
Andy,Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee...
Packer,Thank you.
Phyllis,No way.
Andy,I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion...
Ryan,"I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please."
Val,"Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?"
Erin,And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Darryl,Sure.
Waitress,"Sorry, no waffles."
Val,"Okay, thanks."
Erin,"Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it."
Darryl,"Hey, just so you know, me and you... I don't think that's ridiculous... Dot, dot, dot... dot, dot."
Ryan,A waffle?
Erin,A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Jim,All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Ryan,No.
Cathy,"What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?"
Erin,"I'm moving down here, you know."
Jim,"Cathy, go."
Ryan,"Oh, no, I didn't know."
Dwight,Where's the bug?
Erin,"I'm young, and I can ... and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young."
Jim,Awesome.
Ryan,You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Dwight,Stand back!
Ryan,"Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey."
Cathy,"Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!"
Erin,Hey.
Dwight,It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Pam,Watson carpet and tile.
Cathy,
Kevin,One order.
Jim,Right there!
Oscar,Order reference number 00983-126.
Cathy,"Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Phyllis,"Eight Cases, bright white inkjet."
Jim,"Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!"
Angela,Paid.
Cathy,I can't breathe!
Kelly,I'm dying!
Dwight,I think I saw it!
Darryl,Processed.
Cathy,Stop it!
Val,And delivered.
Jim,"Nice job, I think you got 'em."
Kelly,"Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for."
Dwight,"You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy."
Nellie,I will be right back.
Jim,
Packer,I will be here.
Dwight,Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Dwight,Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Jim,Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Packer,"Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle."
Nellie,Dwight? Hello? Dwight?
Dwight,"Well, saddles... ... sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth."
Jim,Is that Nellie?
Packer,"What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me."
Dwight,Don't let-shh!
Dwight,"If anyone's having s*x with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off."
Nellie,"Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? Dwight? Dwight."
Andy,"Who is ready for dinner? ""oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid"". No. I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves... A Jamaican feast, mon!"
Phyllis,If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Andy,"Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!"
Val,Hey.
Brandon,"How you doing, Val?"
Oscar,"Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff."
Brandon,"Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican."
Oscar,Terrific.
Darryl,What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Brandon,"Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good?"
Darryl,Oh yeah.
Brandon,Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend.
Everyone,Whoa.
Kevin,"Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!"
Darryl,I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Val,"Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?"
Brandon,Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up.
Val,"Honey, I am not sleeping with-"
Andy,"Heyyy... let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!"
Brandon,Hope you all like goat.
Andy,Goat...
Nellie,Blow in my ear.
Packer,Alright.
Nellie,Like I'm on the beach.
Dwight,Seagull.
Nellie,And a wave crashing... a wave crashing.
Nellie,"Oh, that is lovely."
Jim,"Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening."
Jim,"Hey, how's it going?"
Cathy,"Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?"
Jim,"Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball."
Cathy,"Okay, yeah."
Jim,Okay.
Cathy,Cool... Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
Jim,"Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in... March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so..."
Cathy,LeBron James.
Jim,"Yes, nice. Good word association"
Cathy,
Nellie,Impressive.
Dwight,"Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it"
Andy,Thornwood Wholesalers.
Kevin,One order.
Brandon,"I read the text you sent to Val, man."
Val,That's messed up.
Angela,Is this spicy?
Brandon,"No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-"
Andy,"I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something."
Brandon,At midnight?
Andy,... yeah...
Kevin,It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery...
Kelly,"Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here."
Andy,Thank you.
Kelly,I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Andy,"Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?"
Kelly,"No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts."
Jim,"Yup, coming. All right."
Stanley,My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Jim,We have plenty.
Stanley,"Oh, hello."
Jim,Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Stanley,"Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier."
Jim,"No, no, no, Stanley."
Stanley,mm-hmm.
Jim,Stanley. Stanley.
Stanley,uh-huh.
Jim,Stanley. Uhh... you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Erin,Whoa. the lights are still on.
Ryan,"Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off."
Erin,I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Ryan,"Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me."
Erin,"Hello, waffle iron."
Ryan,"Hello, what do we have here?"
Erin,"Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl..."
Ryan,Right.
Erin,... a measuring cup...
Ryan,Got that. Get down.
Erin,It's the fuzz!
Ryan,"Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please."
Darryl,"""I got too much ice cream. You want some?"" ""Getting' my fry on."""
Kelly,Boring.
Darryl,"Uh, ""The moon is huge tonight."""
Phyllis,"Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry."
Darryl,That's regular text talk.
Brandon,You forgot one.
Darryl,"""You're such a great friend."""
Brandon,With the dots.
Darryl,"""You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot."""
Kelly,"Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means ""Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."
Everyone,Oh...
Brandon,"See? Yes. Thank you, sister."
Val,"Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?"
Darryl,"Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here."
Nellie,You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Dwight,"You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy."
Jim,"I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt."
Dwight,"Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor."
Gabe,"Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis."
Dwight,I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Gabe,What's in it for GSL?
Dwight,You really want Packer as your boss?
Gabe,Got it.
Dwight,"If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses."
Dwight,Where did you see it?
Jim,In the bed.
Cathy,I haven't seen anything.
Dwight,We gotta find it before it eggs.
Cathy,Jeez...
Dwight,Describe it.
Jim,"Brown, shiny, painful bite."
Dwight,Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Jim,"Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation."
Dwight,"Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?"
Jim,"So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this."
Dwight,Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Jim,Yeah.
Dwight,Everything's a joke.
Jim,I know.
Dwight,Check your hair!
Jim,Ow.
Dwight,"God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this."
Jim,Just check it.
Dwight,"You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide I am going to generate myself into a human trap. When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing."
Jim,Alright.
Dwight,Yeah. Cover me!
Cathy,Is this really nessecary?
Jim,He knows what he's doing.
Dwight,Let the bedbugs bite!
Cathy,"Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower."
Jim,"Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?"
Dwight,"Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine."
Toby,We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
Ryan,Are you holding this chair?
Kelly,You think you're so pretty!  Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Dwight,Yes.
Toby,"Okay, this is what's called pre-violent posturing."
Ryan,â€˜cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off.
Kelly,Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore!
Dwight,Yes. Yes.
Toby,"Okay, I'm at what's called ""the decision point."""
Ryan,I'm not wearing the right shoes for this.
Andy,"Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!"
Dwight,"We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots."
Pam,"Oh boy. Oh no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning."
Erin,Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Andy,"You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby.  I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ""Where were you when the girls came?"""
Erin,"Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It's me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me."
Andy,"Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good!"
Nellie,"Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ... what's lower than dirt?"
Dwight,"Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation."
Dwight,"Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core."
Nellie,Dwight.  You're the vice president.
Nellie,"Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback."
Dwight,"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!"
Jim,Which Spice Girl?
Nellie,
Nellie,The black one. I never stood a chance.
Dwight,Okay! Come on!
Jim,Okay.
Nellie,aagh!
Nellie,"Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey."
Dwight,Hah! Yah! Boom!
Dwight,"Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much."
Todd Packer,Yep
Dwight,"Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing â€“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love â€˜em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?"
Ryan,"When people see this presentation, they're gonna in their pants."
Dwight,Okay.
Jim,"Come on, man."
Cathy,Seriously disgusting.
Dwight,"Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers."
Cathy,Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
Dwight,"Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid."
Todd Packer,Uh...
Nellie,Uh... that is excellent.
Todd Packer,"I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player."
Dwight,"Perfect casting, right?"
Todd Packer,"Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator."
Nellie,"I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples."
Dwight,"Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!"
Andy,"Morning, everyone."
Kevin,"Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?"
Andy,Don't care. Tell me later.
Kevin,"Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this."
Andy,What do you got?
Kelly,"Oh, my god!"
Phyllis,Do you have a black eye?
Andy,"Yes, I do. Phyllis."
Kevin,I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Andy,What?
Kevin,It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car.
Darryl,"Andy, who punched you?"
Meredith,"Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office?"
Angela,"Black eye, Meredith."
Kelly,"Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering."
Andy,"Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam..."
Pam,That's true.
Andy,"They had, uh... weapons."
Pam,Weapons.
Andy,I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Pam,But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Andy,"Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime."
Pam,Thank goodness he was there.
Oscar,Good job Andy.
Kevin,Yeah
Andy,I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.
Dwight,Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
Man,Quit it.
Dwight,"There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir."
Erin,I was ahead of you!
Dwight,"Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids."
Erin,Come on. I was in line before you.
Cathy,So you're a blogger right?
Blogger,Yeah. Blogger.
Cathy,"God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once."
Erin,"Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing... zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun."
Oscar,How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Andy,No.
Angela,Yes.
Andy,"No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?"
Pam,Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Andy,"And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area."
Angela,Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Andy,Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Pam,1-8-5-0-5.
Darryl,"Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7."
Phyllis,"Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police."
Angela,Yes.
Andy,"Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why... Toby is giving us self defense training."
Toby,Me?
Andy,Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
Toby,"Yeah, um... I can't believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup."
Andy,Great.
Nellie,Yes!
Blogger,Okay.
Nellie,I wasn't really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Jim,"Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?"
Blogger,"Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it."
Blogger 2,This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.
Jim,"Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay."
Nellie,"Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad."
Dwight,"Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing."
Dwight,Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Jim,I'm very sorry.
Nellie,"We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ""Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim. I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape."""
Jim,"I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?"
Dwight,"You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do."
Dwight,"Point it towards the store, idiot!"
Dwight,You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
Dwight,"Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!"
Erin,We are closed! Come on.
Toby,"Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it."
Creed,
Meredith,Ow.
Toby,That may have been my fault.
Meredith,"What the hell, Toby?"
Toby,"Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. ""It's all about the groin."""
Andy,What if you're being attacked by a ... smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
Toby,I don't think that's very common.
Andy,"What if you're being attacked by a 4'11"" man who is penisless?"
Oscar,Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Andy,"Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man."
Toby,"Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female."
Andy,"So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?"
Toby,"It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker.  You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu."
Angela,Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
Toby,"All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so... you're being attacked. You've got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two."
Everyone,"One, two."
Andy,"Take that, kid."
Dwight,"Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine."
Lady Blogger,Patty Grossman. I'm a woman.
Dwight,"But you still work for Wired, right?"
Patty,Yes.
Dwight,Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Ryan,Sabre. It's time to come home.
Jim,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous."
Ryan,"Yeah, no, Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?"
Dwight,"Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen."
Ryan,You know what?
Dwight,You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
Jim,Dwight.
Dwight,I'm trying to make him feel important.
Ryan,God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Dwight,"Um... Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee."
Ryan,You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Dwight,What's a book?
Ryan,"On my God. You're so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though."
Jim,You can... You can do it Ryan.
Ryan,And you know that I'm capable of this.
Jim,"You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie."
Ryan,What did you think of the presentation?
Jim,"I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --"
Ryan,"Oh! ""Fix"" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!"
Dwight,"Jim, get him a water."
Ryan,"No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!"
Dwight,Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Toby,"Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive."
Lady,"Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?"
Andy,I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Girl,That's him... the guy I hit.
Darryl,What?
Oscar,You've gotta be kidding me.
Kevin,"Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?"
Oscar,"No, Kevin --"
Lady,What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?
Girl,There. That chubby one.
Pam,I just had a baby.
Girl,Yesterday?
Pam,Wow.
Lady,Apologize.
Girl,"Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your ""thin"" girlfriend."
Pam,How â€˜bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
Lady,You know what? Tiffy's going to college.
Andy,"Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day."
Lady,God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.
Kevin,Bye.
Kelly,"So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ""How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls."""
Toby,There's no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
Kelly,"No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere."
Darryl,"Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop."
Andy,Oh...
Dwight,Have you seen Erin?
Stanley,I'm on break.
Dwight,Oh God...  Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
Blogger,When's the presentation?
Dwight,It's moments away. Just stay here!
Ryan,"Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife?  Well, that doesn't make any sense to me."
Nellie,How you doing?
Ryan,"Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is..."
Nellie,Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
Erin,"Sorry about kicking you out. It's just, we don't want our brand associated with death."
Old Lady,It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.
Erin,You're not married yet?
Old Lady,"Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away."
Erin,"My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends."
Old Lady,Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!
Erin,Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
Old Lady,Well...
Dwight,How long has he been in the bathroom?
Jim,About ten minutes.
Dwight,Jeez! What's he doing in there?
Jim,"Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?"
Dwight,Are there any bloggers around?
Jim,"It's Ryan. ""I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home."""
Nellie,What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?
Dwight,"I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!"
Jim,Uh...
Nellie,What?
Dwight,That's right. Will you just give us a second?
Nellie,You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
Jim,okay.
Nellie,That's....
Dwight,Jim --
Jim,I'm not doing the Presentation.
Dwight,"Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim."
Jim,"Okay, I'll do it."
Dwight,"Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes."
Jim,A costume?
Dwight,"Of course there's a costume!  Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation."
Dwight,Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
Jim,I've been in here for 20 seconds.
Dwight,Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Jim,I'm not wearing eyeliner.
Dwight,"You are wearing eyeliner, Jim."
Jim,"Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. No, that's --"
Dwight,It's true.
Jim,"This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain."
Dwight,Yep.
Jim,"When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me.  I just wanted... to go home.  This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013.  You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space."
Crowd,ahhhhhh
Dwight,Psst.
Jim,Oh.
Ryan,Sabre... It's time... to come home.
Crowd,
Jim,All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night!
Jim,Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you.
Toby,"Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay?  We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous."
Kevin,"Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity."
Toby,Okay. Good point...
Angela,Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Toby,I don't... I don't...
Oscar,With all due respect we know what we're defending against
Kelly,I was a twelve year old bully.
Angela,Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
Others,Yeah.
Kelly,"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression."
Angela,Thanks.
Kelly,Good. Let's go.
Toby,I don't know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Angela,Let's go Kelly.
Andy,"Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us."
Robert California,"What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution."
Everyone,What?! Why is that?
Todd Packer,"If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute."
Andy,"He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever."
Robert California,I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.
Angela,"So, he's alive."
Nellie,"Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul."
Andy,Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
Robert California,That was never on the table.
Angela,"Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead."
Todd Packer,Are you kidding? She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
Andy,How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
Robert California,"And yet Todd, it's you who's fired."
Phyllis,"If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?"
Todd Packer,"What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh?"
Oscar,"You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure."
Darryl,"Hey, hey. They're back."
Oscar,"When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride."
Kelly,"Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?"
Andy,I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.
Jim,"Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?"
Oscar,I am dying to know what's in there.
Kelly,"Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds."
Andy,"Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane."
Phyllis,Hey! Good to have you back.
Creed,"Hi, hello."
Stanley,Good to be back.
Andy,"Now, carefully... open the box."
Pam,"Hey, stranger!"
Creed,It's a photo of all of us.
Jim,Hey.
Pam,"Aw, that's so sweet!"
Pam,"Aw, I missed you."
Dwight,"A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!"
Jim,I missed you.
Dwight,"Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!"
Pam,Aw.
Nellie,"Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP."
Andy,"I'm going to Florida to get Erin. Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!"
Robert California,I am loving the chemistry between you two.
Nellie,I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
Robert California,I bet. I'm excited.
Nellie,Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
Dwight,Ah!
Nellie,I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Dwight,You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples.
Jim,"Oh, that reminds me. Little something from all of us."
Dwight,"Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. Four! Oh yeah!"
Nellie,He doesn't even care.
Dwight,Don't even care!
Jim,"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah."
Darryl,"Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?"
Andy,"Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice."
Darryl,I'll put you down for shortbreads.
Andy,Damn it.
Toby,"Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?"
Darryl,No. No.
Toby,What?
Darryl,I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Toby,"You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? Or chess club, or?"
Darryl,"You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting."
Toby,"That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl."
Darryl,"OK, great."
Darryl,"All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin."
Erin,"Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo."
Elderly Woman,"Oh, here let me help."
Erin,"I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred."
Erin,"Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me."
Irene,"When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all."
Erin,"Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida."
Irene,"Thank you. Oh, what kind of tea is this?"
Erin,"Oh, I boiled some Gatorade."
Nellie,"Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias."
Robert California,"If I may, try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here."
Nellie,Oh.
Robert California,That's right. Your little finger.
Darryl,Would you like to buy some cookies?
Kevin,"Cookies, eh?"
Kevin,"Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth."
Darryl,"It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev."
Kevin,I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Toby,"Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin."
Darryl,"You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport."
Toby,"No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?"
Kevin,I do.
Toby,See?
Darryl,"That doesn't mean anything. Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?"
Kevin,"Oh, I definitely do."
Darryl,"Huh. Hit the road, jack."
Toby,"No, you hit the road, jack."
Kevin,"Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me."
Toby,"You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair."
Kevin,"No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed."
Angela,Ugh.
Kevin,Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar.
Nellie,"Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked."
Jim,All right. So... I guess this is it.
Dwight,"Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win."
Jim,"Goodbye, Dwight."
Dwight,"Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo!"
Jim,"Well, he's Florida's problem now."
Robert California,I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.
Jim,What's that?
Robert California,I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.
Jim,I thought you liked the store?
Robert California,"Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers."
Jim,Thank you.
Robert California,"But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us."
Jim,"Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible."
Robert California,"I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight."
Dwight,"Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!"
Robert California,"Bravo, Dwight! Very good! Shame."
Dwight,"The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre to the power of two."
Nellie,How did that look?
Gabe,"I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen."
Dwight,I told you.
Todd Packer,"When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-"
Dwight,"You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper."
Jim,All right. There he is.
Dwight,What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Jim,Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Dwight,"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?"
Jim,"Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should-"
Dwight,"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell."
Todd Packer,"Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?"
Dwight,Silence.
Todd Packer,"Aw, I'm just trying to-"
Dwight,"I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. But your face does look like the guy from Operation."
Todd Packer,That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
Dwight,Different guy.
Jim,"You know, I just think you should know that-"
Dwight,That you look like the world's tallest hobbit.
Jim,"Well, I tried. You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch."
Erin,Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Irene,Just open the program and type in his user name.
Erin,Can you just do it?
Irene,"Here, type in your password."
Erin,'Erin123'
Irene,"That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat."
Erin,All right.
Andy,Hello?
Erin,That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. Oh. I fixed it.
Andy,"Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. Oh, there we go."
Pam,"He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him."
Jim,"No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'."
Pam,Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Jim,I tried. He will not listen.
Pam,Did you actually try your hardest?
Jim,"Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up."
Stanley,Don't talk to me.
Jim,Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Pam,"If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do."
Jim,OK. All right.
Darryl,What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Phyllis,Yeah.
Kevin,"That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model."
Darryl,Thank you.
Toby,"I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life."
Darryl,"Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my chubby daughter?"
Phyllis,Oh.
Darryl,"Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun."
Kelly,"Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things."
Pam,Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Phyllis,Make them kiss each other.
Meredith,Make them kiss me.
Erin,"Yes, this is too tan. This right here-"
Andy,No.
Erin,This is a tanned spot.
Andy,"I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you."
Erin,"Well, Andy, I'm not coming back."
Andy,What?
Erin,I have a job here. I work for an old lady.
Irene,Hello!
Erin,Andy?
Andy,"Yeah, that's awesome. That's great."
Kevin,"This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me."
Darryl,"No, no, no, no. It's not worth it."
Toby,No.
Kevin,"No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year."
Darryl,"Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?"
Kevin,Hungrier.
Toby,50?
Kevin,Hungrier.
Darryl,You're not talking... triple digits?
Kevin,"Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. Again."
Dwight,Showtime.
Jim,Dwight.
Dwight,"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick."
Jim,"OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?"
Dwight,"Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?"
Jim,Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Dwight,"Jim, come on."
Jim,"Dwight, he's gonna kill the store."
Dwight,Uh-huh.
Jim,"And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it."
Dwight,Wait. He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
Jim,Yes.
Dwight,That's two things.
Jim,"Dwight, please."
Dwight,"Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today."
Jim,"OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-"
Dwight,You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Jim,"Dwight, come o-"
Dwight,"Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!"
Dwight,Help! Help!
Jim,"Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?"
Dwight,AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Jim,Gross!
Dwight,Ah!
Jim,"What? What, what, what, what, what?"
Dwight,"Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-"
Jim,I'm sorry.
Dwight,My wound hasn't healed yet.
Jim,"I'm so sorry, I forgot."
Dwight,"Oh, man!"
Jim,You all right? You ok?
Dwight,Rrrah!
Nellie,Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Cathy,I don't know. He's not picking up.
Todd Packer,"Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man."
Nellie,"Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer."
Todd Packer,Sup?
Phyllis,What are you doing?
Andy,I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
Oscar,We knew. Ryan told us.
Andy,"Ryan, why didn't you tell me?"
Ryan,Thought you checker my Tumblr?
Andy,You never update it.
Ryan,"Well, I updated it."
Andy,"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?"
Pam,"We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine."
Dwight,"Huh, huh, huh!"
Jim,What are you doing?
Dwight,I was trying to go-
Jim,Get up.
Dwight,"Ok, ok."
Jim,Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Dwight,Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
Jim,OK. What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Dwight,Jackie Chan!
Kevin,Go.
Darryl,Hi. This is Alex.
Toby,And this is Sam.
Darryl,Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Kevin,Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Darryl,"I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens."
Toby,"Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names."
Kevin,"Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?"
Toby,"Don't make me be your pony, Kevin."
Darryl,"Forget it, man."
Kevin,What do you mean?
Darryl,I'm out. And so is Toby.
Darryl,This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
Toby,Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
Kevin,"No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. That is... hmph... that's ah... so good."
Jim,"What are you doing? No. No, no, no."
Dwight,This. Ends. Now.
Jim,This is dangerous.
Dwight,Rrahh!
Jim,Why?
Dwight,Anything else you need to talk about?
Jim,Nope. I think that was it.
Dwight,"Once again, it's show time."
Pam,"This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling."
Andy,Erin!
Kevin,Nice.
Erin,Andy.
Pam,"There's this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it's not -- it doesn't sound cool. You just have to see it."
Erin,Let's get out of here.
Pam,"Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal."
Andy,Okay.
Jim,Wow. It's the end of an era.
Erin,Let's go.
Pam,"Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home."
Andy,"Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff."
Oscar,I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
Erin,"No, I don't have any stuff."
Kevin,"When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel."
Andy,Like your toothbrush and stuff.
Ryan,"How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin?"
Erin,I don't have one.
Kevin,"I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ""Look, a balloon."""
Andy,You don't have a toothbrush?
Dwight,My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Erin,No.
Meredith,My kid didn't have a face tattoo.
Andy,How do you not have a toothbrush?
Darryl,I was still thinking of going back to school.
Erin,I just... there's always one around.
Jim,And I was still just a paper salesman.
Andy,You just use whichever one is sitting there?
Dwight,"Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here."
Erin,I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
All,Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon.
Andy,Of course. I own my toothbrush.
Jim,Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Nellie,"I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random."
Kevin,oooh
Darryl,Me.
Phyllis,Yeah.
Dwight,Right here.
Nellie,"Allow me to solve your problem, then."
Jim,Nellie
Nellie,"Mmm. Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?"
Jim,What brings you to town?
Nellie,"Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here."
Dwight,What?
Dwight,How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Toby,Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
Nellie,Mm.
Pam,What?
Toby,"I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby."
Pam,You messed up saying your name?
Toby,"It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in."
Nellie,That one looks empty.
Jim,"No, that's Andy's office."
Nellie,"Oh, is it?"
Nellie,I have one simple philosophy in business
Erin,"Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo."
Alonzo,Good morning Erin.
Erin,How are you? How's your family doing?
Erin,Bye.
Erin,"Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. Listen to me, bragging away."
Robert,Nellie.
Nellie,Robert.
Robert,How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
Nellie,"So far, so good."
Robert,Good.
Nellie,Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Robert,"Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?"
Nellie,Mm-hm.
Robert,"Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?"
Nellie,"Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove."
Robert,We have a manager.
Nellie,Do you really? Because it is 10
Robert,"Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?"
Kevin,"Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?"
Andy,Hello.
Robert,"Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?"
Andy,"Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick."
Robert,"I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately."
Andy,"Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the..."
Andy,...Florida Flu.
Robert,He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Andy,"I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP."
Robert,Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
Jim,Can't you do something about this?
Robert,"Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim."
Jim,#NAME?
Jim,What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Irene,"Erin, you got a package."
Erin,I'm in the bathroom.
Glenn,"Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label."
Irene,Did you wash your hands?
Erin,Yes.
Erin and Irene,
Andy,Here I am
Erin,"Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you."
Andy,"Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you."
Irene,Where's the ring?
Andy,Hm?
Irene,"Where's the ring, Lancelot?"
Erin,"Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn."
Erin,"Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you."
Glenn,Why won't she go with him?
Irene,I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.
Erin,Hey... don't listen.
Nellie,"So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?"
Jim,"I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name."
Nellie,"So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. But why, m'lady? Because I am your new manager."
Pam,"Robert, is Nellie our new manager?"
Robert,This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
Robert,We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
Nellie,"I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way."
Kevin,Hot tub party?
Nellie,Performance reviews.
Pam,How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
Nellie,"On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me."
Glenn,"Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today."
Erin,"Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better."
Irene,"So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?"
Andy,"Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know."
Erin,"So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend."
Irene,"I think you should leave, young man."
Andy,"All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you."
Erin,You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Jim,Any luck?
Pam,No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Andy,"Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-"
Erin,"Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there."
Irene,You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
Andy,"Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger."
Irene,You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session.
Andy,I don't know. Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Irene,You could put it on silent.
Andy,I don't think it does that.
Irene,"Just go to preferences, then click â€“"
Glenn,Proctology.
Jim,Andy?
Andy,Jim?
Jim,"Andy, where are you?"
Andy,"I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man."
Irene,"He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down."
Jim,"What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job."
Andy,"What do you mean, take my job?"
Jim,"Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager."
Andy,"Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later."
Jim,"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager."
Angela,Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Pam,I like working here.
Jim,"Dwight, should she be our manager?"
Dwight,I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Dwight,"Those who can't farm, farm celery."
Jim,And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?
Nellie,"All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis."
Phyllis,"Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know."
Nellie,"Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight."
Dwight,"I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever."
Nellie,"Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise."
Dwight,What?
Nellie,"Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?"
Dwight,There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Nellie,Then you accept it?
Dwight,Five percent. No less.
Nellie,Absolutely not. Seven percent.
Dwight,"Six percent, I know my worth."
Jim,The raise isn't real.
Dwight,Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Nellie,"So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it."
Pam,Phyllis.
Phyllis,Pam.
Nellie,"So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you."
Phyllis,Really?
Nellie,"Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive."
Jim,Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Robert,I am not. Huh.
Jim,"Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis."
Robert,"Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?"
Jim,"Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry."
Robert,"Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss."
Jim,Yes.
Robert,"Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?"
Jim,"Oh, god, nature, please."
Robert,"When two animals are having s*x, one of them..."
Jim,
Robert,... is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
Jim,Was that not the--
Robert,All life is s*x. And all s*x is competition.
Jim,Mm-hm.
Robert,"And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?"
Jim,"Was that it? No, that wasn't bad."
Robert,"My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?"
Jim,No. I would've said no.
Nellie,"Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise."
Kelly,"Oh, great."
Jim,"I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that."
Dwight,"No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now."
Darryl,No.
Dwight,Yes.
Darryl,No.
Dwight,Yes.
Darryl,No.
Dwight,Yes.
Darryl,No.
Dwight,Yes.
Darryl,No.
Dwight,"Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off."
Dwight,"Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow."
Dwight,Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Creed,Touch me and I'll sue.
Erin,I've heard that's amazing when it works.
Andy,"Yeah, if I had my own--"
Erin,"Andy, I care about you and I think--"
Andy,#NAME?
Erin,"No, go ahead."
Andy,"Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?"
Erin,"Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?"
Andy,You broke my heart too.
Erin,"You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be."
Andy,I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
Erin,I know.
Andy,
Nellie,"So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want."
Pam,"Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy."
Nellie,"That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two."
Pam,"Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?"
Nellie,"Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?"
Pam,"Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle."
Nellie,You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
Pam,No.
Nellie,"Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money."
Pam,I think... you're a witch.
Nellie,"I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it"
Pam,I'm amazing.
Irene,"Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy."
Erin,Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Irene,"I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--"
Erin,"Irene, what would you do without me?"
Irene,"We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot."
Erin,Why?
Irene,He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
Nellie,"Jim, time for your review."
Jim,"No, it's not, because you don't really work here."
Nellie,"Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?"
Jim,"Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises."
Nellie,"Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?"
Jim,Yes.
Nellie,I'm Tinkerbell.
Jim,No.
Nellie,"Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises."
Stanley,And we are grateful.
Nellie,"But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist."
Jim,She dies.
Nellie,She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Jim,Let's see it. Show of hands.
Kevin,I do. Come on everyone...
Jim,"All right, guys, stop."
Meredith,I already spent the money.
Jim,How?
Kevin,"Come on Jim, you're killing her!"
All,We believe! We believe!
Robert,Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe.
Andy,"That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it."
Erin,"Andy wait! Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I'm sorry."
Pam,Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
Pam,Oh!
Jim,"Oh, great. ""Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy."" Oh that's not good."
Erin,That was a really rough scene.
Phyllis,"Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious."
Andy,Right? Rough scene.
Pam,It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Erin,Yeah.
Jim,Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Andy,Oh... at least we can kiss now.
Pam,Yeah he does.
Erin,"Oh, yeah."
Oscar,"Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache."
Andy,"You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time."
Pam,"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?"
Erin,"Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired."
Phyllis,"Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't."
Andy,Yeah.
Pam,Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Erin,Probably from seeing that turkey.
Jim,"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?"
Andy,Oh yeah.
Angela,'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Erin,When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Pam,"Okay, which one of these looks more right?"
Magician,"Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?"
Dwight,"Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left."
Jim,"Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer."
Gabe,"Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?"
Robert,"no, Nellie, she-"
Jim,"Okay, quick. Who says moustache?"
Jim,I'll do it.
Dwight,Yep.
Magician,"Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is."
Jim,"Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands"
Jim,It's the four of hearts.
Gabe,Ah! Ha ha ha!
Robert,"Oh, no, you-"
Phyllis,He does have a moustache.
Magician,"Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?"
Dwight,Yes!
Robert,Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
Pam,"Welcome back, Stanley."
Magician,"Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory."
Robert,"""Good morning, Robert,"" says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. Pam!"
Jim,Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Pam,Oh!
Magician,But I never could seem to figure out those knots.
Robert,"Is this a video conference you're having with ""Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz""?"
Pam,"That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears."
Pam,"Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day."
Magician,"What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-"
Robert,"People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-"
Dwight,"Okay scram, wizard."
Nellie,"Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness."
Magician,What?
Robert,"Nellie, really, nine fifty?"
Dwight,You heard me!
Nellie,"Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze."
Magician,Huh!
Robert,Ah.
Robert,"Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-"
Nellie,"Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!"
Nellie,"Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?"
Robert,I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
Robert,"Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party."
Nellie,Ah ha!
Kevin,"You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?"
Robert,I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
Erin,What? Why are we-
Nellie,"Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it."
Andy,I just gotta do one thing.
Robert,"No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life."
Megan,"Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here."
Nellie,"Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?"
Jessica,What are you doing here?
Kevin & Meredith,Yes.
Andy,"Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material."
Nellie,Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
Megan,Why the hell did you come back here?
Kevin,None taken.
Jessica,Go away.
Oscar,"Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive."
Kenny,Get lost!
Nellie,"oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!"
Woman,Get out!
Stanley,Who's a native?
Andy,Okay.
Nellie,"Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court."
Lauren,You're done!
Oscar,What does that mean?
Andy,Bye guys.
Dwight,"Okay, okay."
Lauren,"Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? Yeah, run away!"
Nellie,"If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?"
Kenny,You're disgusting!
Robert,Nellie?
Lauren,I can't believe you're not gay!
Nellie,"Yes, Robert!"
Kenny,Yeah get out of here.
Robert,You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
Various,Don't come back.
Nellie,Yeah.
Erin,Uh-oh!
Robert,"Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place."
Various,You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
Dwight,Why Jim?
Pam,Hey Hank.
Robert,"The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community."
Hank,Yes ma'am.
Pam,"I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?"
Pam,I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Jim,"I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment."
Hank,Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.
Pam,I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
Jim,"Well, turns out he actually made it up there."
Jim,Why is she here?
Hank,What? That ain't right.
Andy,Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
Pam,"Yeah, he came and went."
Erin,Going to Pennsylvania.
Hank,"Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been..."
Andy,"On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania."
Pam,Let's just- let's go.
Erin,Oh. That must be nice.
Jim,Night-night.
Andy,Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Erin,"Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents."
Andy,Oh. Hmm.
Andy,Time to have a little kiss!
Erin,No.
Andy,Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
Erin,Yes.
Andy,I believe in that.
Erin,Yes. So do I.
Andy,"I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important."
Erin,Important.
Andy,Mm-hmm.
Phyllis,I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Pam,"I know, right?"
Oscar,"She's always late, she's always rude..."
Phyllis,It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Oscar,Yeah.
Phyllis,On purpose.
Pam,Phyllis!
Angela,We should do it right here in the break room.
Phyllis,Order carrot cake.
Andy,"...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you."
Erin,"Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds."
Andy,Consider it nailed.
Erin,"I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario."
Andy,"Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-"
Erin,What?
Andy,I just need you to know-
Erin,What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.
Dwight,Ugh! Ow.
Jim,"Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door."
Dwight,"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? ""Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."""
Jim,That was one time-
Dwight,I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Nellie,"Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic."
Jim,"Excuse me, one second. Hi."
Pam,"Hey, what's up?"
Jim,"Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight."
Dwight,Haulin' cube!
Jim,That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Pam,"So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad."
Jim,Sounds like every other party.
Pam,"No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card."
Jim,Oh! Hire a magician.
Pam,What?
Jim,Trust me.
Pam,Okay.
Andy,Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
Lauren,"Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?"
Andy,"Hey, Lauren. Look at you."
Lauren,"Well, I know. Look at me."
Andy,"I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica."
Lauren,Aww!
Andy,"Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car."
Lauren,Oh. God.
Erin,"So, I'm Erin. Hi."
Andy,Yep. This is Erin.
Lauren,"Nice to meet you. Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here!"
Erin,"Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?"
Andy,"Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-"
Lauren,"Oh, Jess! Look who stopped by after his business trip!"
Jessica,Andy! Hey!
Dwight,I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
Jim,"Yes, you should."
Dwight,Ooh.
Jim,"""Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie."""
Dwight,I have to see these shoes.
Jim,I doubt that they're sh-
Dwight,Oh!
Jim,Whoa. Who is this guy?
Dwight,Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Jim,Boyfriend.
Dwight,Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Jim,Like a boyfriend?
Dwight,You read my mind.
Jim,Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Dwight,Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
Jim,Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Nellie,Oh.
Jim,"Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just..."
Nellie,I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
Dwight,Why not call...
Jim,Shh!
Nellie,"God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant."
Dwight,That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
Jim,Dwight!
Nellie,"I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?"
Jim,I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Dwight,"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick."
Nellie,"Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this."
Jim,"No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or..."
Nellie,"God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?"
Jim,"You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff."
Pam,"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you."
Jim,"No, that's not what I-"
Nellie,"Jim, could you give us a hand?"
Jim,"Absolutely. Yeah. Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me."
Pam,"Oh, okay. Okay, I will."
Angela,"Pam, we have a great idea."
Oscar,Listen to this.
Angela,We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
Pam,Or what if...
Angela,Okay.
Pam,"We discuss... the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. Not mean."
Angela,"I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know."
Oscar,We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Pam,What are you talking about? Yes we can.
Oscar,What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Phyllis,"Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks."
Lauren,Suck it!
Erin,Andy-
Andy,It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy pen1s?
Erin,"No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears."
Andy,These are delicious.
Erin,But... they're penises.
Lauren,And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together.
Andy,"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one."
Party guests,"No, pop it. Pop it!"
Jessica,Hey.
Andy,Hey.
Jessica,Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
Megan,Ahh!
Andy,"Oh! Ah, Megan."
Megan,"You are one of the good ones, nard dog."
Andy,Aww.
Megan,"No, really. Where's my Andy?"
Jessica,I dunno.
Andy,"Oh, he's out there."
Megan,Aww. Are you going to sing for us?
Andy,"Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so..."
Megan,"That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!"
Andy,By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
Pam,"Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?"
Darryl,"Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag."
Ryan,"Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult."
Oscar,Plus everyone would know who you meant.
Ryan,Yeah!
Pam,"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?"
Angela,Nobody's named Monday.
Ryan,"Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember."
Pam,'Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
Kevin,"Shh, here she comes!"
All,Hey!
Phyllis,Welcome to your party.
Creed,Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long.
Creed,"Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, ""Have you heard my originals? They're terrible."" They said, ""Even better."" I said, ""I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie."""
Erin,Maybe we should just go.
Andy,"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?"
Jessica,"Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?"
Andy,"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?"
Jessica,"Uh, yeah. What is it?"
Andy,"Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends."
Jessica,You're breaking up with me?
Andy,"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now."
Jessica,"Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?"
Andy,Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Jessica,What?
Andy,"I am gay, and I prefer men."
Kenny,I knew it!
Andy,"You did not, Kenny!"
Kenny,You invited me to go shopping with you.
Andy,I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
Jessica,"Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable."
Andy,"Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos."
Jessica,I can't say it doesn't make sense...
Andy,"Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-"
Jessica,"Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now."
Andy,Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. So... we should probably... go.
Robert,This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
Oscar,"To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company."
Robert,Cheers.
Nellie,Why thank you.
Oscar,"Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company."
All,Cheers.
Angela,"Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died."
Jim,"Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with."
Creed,We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
All,We hate Pam! We hate Pam!
Magician,So we've established-
Jim,No. No.
Magician,#NAME?
Phyllis,"Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley."
Pam,"Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!"
Jim,"Phyllis says the same twelve clichÃ©s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates."
Ryan,You are toxic! You are toxic!
Darryl,So how was the drive in?
Pam,Boo!
Phyllis,"Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain."
Jim,"Hey, hey. Okay."
Darryl,You don't say?
Ryan,"Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt."
Phyllis,Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Kelly,I wasn't going to interrupt.
Phyllis,"Oh, the plants are gonna love this."
Ryan,"Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably."
Oscar,Yeah.
Pam,"Barf! Ugh, you suck!"
Phyllis,I actually sleep better when it's raining.
Ryan,"What is your problem? Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me."
Meredith,Tell me about it.
Wrangler,Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!
Oscar,Time's almost up. How many are left?
Ryan,Can we turn this-ing thing around? Thank you.
Pam,"Just one. ""This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book."""
Wrangler,She don't wanna turn around.
Darryl,Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Ryan,"Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly."
Phyllis,What do you mean?
Kelly,Ryan.
Pam,"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?"
Ryan,Will you roll those dice with me?
Jim,"Hey, come on."
Kelly,"You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him."
Phyllis,Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Ryan,No you don't.
Jim,And that's noon. Exactly.
Kelly,I do.
Phyllis,"I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here."
Ryan,No you don't.
Andy,My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
Kelly,I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Andy & Erin,"Hey la, hey la..."
Ryan,What?
Andy,...my girlfriend's back!
Kelly,That was really cool.
Erin,...his girlfriend's back!
Angela,Ugh. Eww!
Andy,"Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi."
Jim,"Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing."
Kevin,Welcome home.
Angela,Oh God!
Erin,Thank you.
Robert,"Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job."
Andy,"Hey, Kev."
Andy,No.
Kevin,Yeah.
Nellie,It's the apology. I really have to insist.
Andy,Nice sweater.
Andy,No.
Kevin,Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Nellie,Stop saying no.
Andy,What happened to old salty?
Andy,No.
Dwight,Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Robert,"Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?"
Dwight,"I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter."
Andy,No.
Andy,Okey dokey.
Andy,"I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive."
Nellie,Yes?
Erin,Here-
Andy,"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about."
Andy,"Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it."
Nellie,Oh yes.
Erin,But you hurt your hand.
Andy,I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Andy,I... Got... It.
Nellie,You are most welcome.
Erin,Right now?
Andy,"Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance."
Andy,Yes.
Nellie,No.
Pam,You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Andy,"Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better."
Jim,"Not at all, can we go?"
Nellie,Mm-hmm.
Pam,"""Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches."""
Andy,Get back to normalcy.
Jim,Second line.
Nellie,"Hmm, no."
Pam,"""He is a drifter out to sea."""
Ravi,"...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call."
Jim,"""And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green."""
Pam,"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have."
Pam,"It's just so dumb. But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft..."
Jim,That's it.
Jim,"Uh, Ryan can never know."
Kelly,"It's no bother, you guys are our friends."
Pam,"Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl."
Jim,"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it."
Pam,Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
Pam,Kelly has been a handful in the past.
Kelly,Why?
Pam,But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. And I just had to get her clean.
Kevin,Get lower.
Ryan,"Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby."
Jim,"Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby."
Ryan,"Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that."
Pam,Don't shake our baby?
Ryan,Yeah.
Pam,"Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you."
Ryan,"Oh, my God."
Pam,"Yeah, I'm glad you said something."
Ryan,Me too.
Ryan,"Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not."
Ryan,"Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?"
Pam,"Yeah, they're really great together."
Ryan,"Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?"
Jim,"That's about it, yeah."
Robert,"Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-"
Nellie,No.
Robert,I'm sorry?
Andy,This is what I was trying to tell you.
Robert,I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me.
Nellie,"Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes."
Robert,You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
Robert,I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
Nellie,"I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars."
Andy,Okay.
Nellie,Five... four...
Andy,You can't dock my pay-
Nellie,Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Angela,On it!
Andy,"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?"
Nellie,Do you want to go again?
Andy,Angela?
Nellie,Let's go again. Five... four...
Andy,"Ooh, she's counting again."
Nellie,Three... two... one...
Andy,"Oh, oh!"
Nellie,"Angela, two hundred dollars!"
Angela,You got it.
Andy,"Seriously, Angela?"
Andy,I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Erin,"When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this."
Nellie,"I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! Five... four..."
Andy,You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
Nellie,Three...
Andy,It's literally like-
Nellie,Two... one.
Erin,"There you go. Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date."
Erin,Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Andy,"Oh, yeah, I was just tired."
Erin,"We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self."
Andy,"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night."
Erin,Really. It's not a big deal.
Andy,Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Ryan,I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Kelly,"Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share."
Ryan,"Yeah, the fractional ownership property. Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight."
Kelly,God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Ryan,"You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link."
Ryan,"I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change."
Erin,When you lost the manager job-
Dwight,Yes?
Erin,Did it affect you outside of the office?
Dwight,How?
Erin,I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Dwight,"Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never."
Erin,"Oh, okay."
Dwight,Okay?
Erin,Okay.
Dwight,Washington Monument.
Erin,Oh.
Dwight,Eiffel Tower.
Erin,"Okay, okay."
Pam,I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Kelly,"He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, ""Kelly, that will be the color of our children."""
Pam,"Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?"
Kelly,Which time?
Pam,"I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming."
Dwight,One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
Dwight,Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Dwight,"Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that."
Nellie,What do you mean?
Dwight,"Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant."
Nellie,"I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood."
Nellie,"Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room."
Andy,You can't call a meeting. But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Nellie,"Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started."
Andy,Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Nellie,No.
Andy,Wanted to talk to all of you guys about importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Robert,"Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is ""impotence."""
Nellie,"Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy."
Nellie,"""Take a man's job, but leave him his balls."" Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie."
Nellie,This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
Dwight,"It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male."
Oscar,"Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?"
Nellie,"Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men."
Robert & Creed,How old?
Creed,Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
Nellie,Dwight told me about it earlier.
Erin,Dwight!
All,What?
Erin,You promised!
Kevin,Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now."
Angela,What are you doing?
Oscar,What is this?
Angela,"Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it."
Andy,"Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?"
Andy,I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Andy,Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
Jim,Um...
Darryl,"Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what."
Robert,It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
Andy,Fascinating.
Gabe,"I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like s*x, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton."
Nellie,"Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?"
Kevin,Tip-top shape.
Nellie,Oh... Stanley?
Stanley,No. Um-um.
Nellie,"Creed, you are a thousand years old."
Creed,Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
Andy,"Okay, so I-"
Pam,"Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it."
Jim,What happened?
Pam,That a couple of times-
Jim,Couple of times.
Robert,"Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times."
Dwight,Yeah Jim.
Andy,"Yeah Jim, get it out there."
Jim,"Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had s*x so many times already, I was exhausted..."
Pam,"Okay, stop."
Jim,I was very drunk.
Phyllis,"If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four."
Phyllis,Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done.
Gabe,I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
Angela,Ugh.
Gabe,"This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on."
Robert,"No, that's absolutely the case."
Gabe,"I know, right?"
Dwight,"You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it."
Robert,"Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share?"
Kevin,"Ooh, ooh!"
Jim,"Wow, what are we talking about?"
Erin,"Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?"
Toby,"Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything."
Nellie,"The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral."
Robert,I almost didn't come in today.
Andy,"Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet."
Nellie,"Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional."
Erin,"Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! Take 'em yourself!"
Andy,"Oh, and another thing! Our s*x life is none of your businesses!"
Erin,"And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!"
Andy,"Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!"
Nellie,"Okay, just calm down."
Andy,You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
Robert,"Andy, why don't you just take a seat?"
Andy,"Why don't you take a seat, you idiot?"
Erin,And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Andy,And your stupid face! And your stupid office! Ah!
Darryl,He does not like that wall.
Erin,Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Andy,That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Robert,"Andy, Erin, you can join us now."
Ryan,"Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly."
Pam,All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Ryan,"Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face."
Pam,"Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before"
Ryan,Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Oscar,"Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better."
Ryan,For Kelly?
Kevin,"Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package."
Nate,"I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy."
Ryan,"Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it."
Pam,"Oh, no, no, no."
Oscar,"Oh, come on."
Pam,"Read it, please. I love amazing poetry."
Ryan,No. It would cause me too much pain.
Pam,Read through the pain. Be strong.
Ryan,This poem would crush you!
Oscar,"Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!"
Kevin,"Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone."
Ryan,"You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world."
Kelly,Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Robert,"Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny."
Andy,No.
Robert,Excuse me?
Andy,I'm saying no.
Robert,Well you can't say no.
Andy,No.
Ryan,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no."
Pam,"Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?"
Ryan,Smokey's dead.
Pam,"Smokey, the bear?"
Ryan,"Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know."
Jim,"Wow That's terrible, I really liked him."
Ryan,Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Jim,"Well, I second that emotion."
Ryan,Huh?
Nellie,"I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?"
Ryan,"Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, ""Tracks of my Tears""?"
Nellie,Yeah
Ryan,"Um... God, so many, Nellie!"
Pam,"No, no, no, ""Tracks of My Tears"" and what else? What are some more? What's one more?"
Ryan,"Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today."
Pam,I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Ryan,"Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles."
Dwight,You don't like the Beatles?
Ryan,That's... That's not the point!
Dwight,Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
Ryan,"Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?"
Oscar,It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Ryan,"Okay well, that's a relief!"
Jim,Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Pam,"Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!"
Jim,Tickets are 250 bucks.
Pam,250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Ryan,Yeah... Who's opening?
Jim,Paul Anka.
Ryan,Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Jim,"Okay, you could just show up late though."
Ryan,"How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want."
Pam,Tears of a clown!
Ryan,"Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!"
Darryl,"Looking good, RC!"
Robert,"Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation s*x club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?"
Angela,Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Angela,My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Dwight,"I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed"
Jim,"Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people..."
Oscar,What's going on?
Dwight,There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Erin,Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
Dwight,"That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male ""hanging out"". Call the cops!"
Pam,"Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody."
Phyllis,"How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?"
Dwight,"I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case."
Nellie,"I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered."
Andy,Hey!
Erin,"Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see."
Angela,We think you might kill Robert.
Andy,What?
Kevin,because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Andy,"guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser."
Pam,"Oh, great! That sounds good!"
Kevin,"Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird."
Andy,Why would that be weird?
Kevin,"It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week."
Erin,Andy's just coming as my date.
Kevin,"Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird."
Nellie,Come in!
Darryl,"You really re-did Andy's office, huh?"
Nellie,"Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal."
Darryl,"I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out."
Nellie,How are things in the warehouse?
Darryl,You could go downstairs and ask them?
Nellie,The warehouse isn't downstairs? Is it? Is it?
Darryl,"Who knew, right?"
Nellie,I...
Nellie,Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Angela,"Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello."
Andy,"Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?"
Kevin,"Oh man, this is weird!"
Robert,Andrew.
Andy,"Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! I had you, I had you!"
Andy,"Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!"
Kevin,"Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!"
Creed,"Well, I don't want to get raped Twenty-Two!"
Kevin,No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Dwight,"Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!"
Kevin,"Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand."
Dwight,"You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!"
Kevin,"So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!"
Andy,"What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it."
Jim,"Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us."
Andy,The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Pam,Sounds like you're doing alright.
Andy,"Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!"
Ryan,"Oh, this guy is having a breakdown."
Senator,"You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals."
Oscar,my dog Gerald is my life.
Senator,"really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me."
Oscar,This confirms three things
Robert,I stepped in right away and start--
Andy,"Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?"
Robert,Well...
Andy,"You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control."
Robert,"So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?"
Andy,Evil! although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Robert,"and the hero, who's that based on?"
Andy,"Me, I guess. We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!"
Meredith,Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Stanley,"She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni"
Andy,You're being a Thomas Oregon!
Robert,"Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?"
Andy,"Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?"
Robert,Andy you should leave. Now.
Andy,"Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please."
Waiter,"I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units."
Andy,then I'll take a table!
Waiter,Okay
Andy,"And a high five! Oh, let's do this again!"
Andy,"Oh, yes indeed... When! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! When!"
Oscar,I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Pam,Oh my god!
Oscar,I know!
Jim,"Wait, what? Come on!"
Oscar,"We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it."
Jim,"Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?"
Oscar,"Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote."
Jim,"Okay, what was this look?"
Pam,Whoa!
Jim,"What happened, did he do it?"
Pam,Are you-- Twice! For real?
Jim,"Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey."
Pam,Life is Downton Abbey.
Jim,Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Dwight,How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Dwight,It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
Andy,Hey... David Wallace!
David,Andy Bernard!
Andy,"Hey, how are you?"
David,"How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?"
Andy,"No, got canned last week."
David,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
Andy,"No, best thing that ever happened to me."
David,"That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It."
Andy,Yikes!
David,"Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!"
Nellie,"Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?"
Darryl,Tacos.
Nellie,What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Darryl,I can go get us some tacos.
Nellie,Brilliant!
Darryl,If you loan me some money.
Nellie,"Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?"
Darryl,$30.00 
Nellie,"$30, yes!"
Nellie,"I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!"
Oscar,So?
Jim,Boom!
Oscar,This is interesting.
Pam,Hm-hmm.
Jim,what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Pam,Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Oscar,He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Pam,"Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!"
Jim,"Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!"
Speaker,"Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!"
Robert,Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
Andy,can you believe this guy?
Robert,"The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes!"
Andy,Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
Robert,"Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will"
Andy,I will! I will take all of those dogs!
Robert,"Andy, that's very kind--"
Andy,"No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated."
Robert,Andy why don't we discuss this at a--
Andy,"No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!"
Erin,Oh God!
Senator,"Mr. Bernard, right this way."
Andy,Okay! Hope you all learned something!
Vet,"Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream."
Andy,I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Vet,"Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis."
Andy,Stupid dog.
Senator,"Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number."
Meredith,Thank you!
Pam,"Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar."
Oscar,sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Oscar,"No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster."
Darryl,"Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!"
Nellie,"Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!"
Darryl,Hmhmm.
Nellie,Mmm! Uhh Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
Darryl,She's trying.
Speaker,The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight,Yes! Thank you!
Speaker,The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight,Oh yes! Yeah!
Speaker,A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
Dwight,"Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!"
Speaker,"Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!"
Dwight,"Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!"
Speaker,"Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars!"
Jim,Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Dwight,"Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something"
Senator,Oscar!
Oscar,"Nice to see you again, it was lovely!"
Senator,It was lovely! And don't forget to call.
Oscar,okay
Senator,thanks so much for coming
Oscar,why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
Andy,so it just goes on under here like this?
Vet,that's right!
Andy,"Ugh, oh god!"
Vet,"Yeah, you never get used to that."
Jim,"Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing."
Andy,I am so great!
Erin,"He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse."
Jim,"Look at that one though, he's smiling!"
Vet,"Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle."
Andy,This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
Pam,"Absolutely, it's awesome--"
Jim,Yes--
Kevin,"I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best."
Andy,"You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--"
Vet,"Maybe you would think it too! I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations."
Jim,"Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh."
Pam,"Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!"
Andy,"Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!"
Jim,Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Andy,"Yeah, I do. I have that."
Jim,Yeah
Erin,You're going to be alright
Kevin,No. No he's not.
Andy,"Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!"
Kevin,You're welcome!
Kevin,Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Erin,So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Darryl,"Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs."
Kevin,"My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill."
Pam,What do you feed her?
Kevin,"Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!"
Darryl,Is she sick? How are her poops?
Kevin,"Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it."
Pam,Does she smell?
Kevin,"She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown."
Kevin,"People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!"
Gabe,"Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat."
Nellie,"Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?"
Dwight,"Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? Mwah."
Pam,Um... yes. Definitely. With your hair â€“
Gabe,I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque.
Nellie,Oh!
Dwight,"Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?"
Pam,Certainly. Um... you dropped your cell phone.
Gabe,Yeah.
Nellie,"Oh, gosh."
Dwight,"Oh, please."
Pam,Yep.
Gabe,Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One â€“ lengthen. Two â€“ elongate.
Nellie,Thank you. I'm... so stupid.
Jim,"Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that â€“ flat curl contest."
Pam,No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Jim,"All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go."
Nellie,"Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started."
Dwight,"Feast on this, Lewis."
Pam,"No, I will not."
Gabe,I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Nellie,"You've just got me started. Robert... is... a filthy beast. I mean, don't you get the feeling, he's just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?"
Jim,"Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed."
Pam,Well â€“
Gabe,Speed set. One. Two.
Nellie,"I mean, the man talks of nothing but s*x."
Jim,"Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows."
Pam,But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals.
Dwight,"Oh, thank you."
Nellie,I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Jim,You're welcome.
Pam,No... don't. Just put it out of your mind.
Gabe,Five. Six.
Nellie,"Pam, what is your address? I'm gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don't â€“"
Jim,"Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,"
Nellie,"Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper."
All,"Eight, nine, ten."
Nellie,Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And... I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Gabe,We got it?
Robert,Erin.
Dwight,Very funny Jim.
Erin,There's a call for you on line one.
Gabe,"Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies."
Robert,Who is it?
Robert,"Everyone, conference room, now."
Erin,He says salvation. No last name.
Jim,"All right, easy there, grandpa."
Robert,"Yeah, hello?"
Dwight,I don't need your help.
Andy,"You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer."
Jim,Okay. You don't need my help?
Robert,You're blackmailing me.
Dwight,"Here, here... Just..."
Andy,It's just business.
Andy,Morning.
Robert,"Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don't even know my real name. I'm the *bleep* lizard king."
Erin,Hey.
Andy,Whoa. Well I gave him a chance.
Andy,Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot... these.
David,Andy Bernard.
Erin,Oh.
Andy,You got a minute?
Andy,You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
David,Um... I'm in the middle of a piano lesson.
Erin,"Andy, if you're gonna hang out for a while, uh..."
Andy,I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
Andy,What's this?
David,Dunder Mifflin. Now... why would I want that? It's worth half of what it was three years ago.
Erin,"This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in."
Andy,Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
Andy,Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me?
David,Why don't you come in?
Erin,"No, of course not. It's just â€“ I think it's like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it's like, where does it end? So just..."
Harry,So what would you do if you weren't selling paper?
Andy,"Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? ...Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like."
Jim,"Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions."
Jim,"All right, well, enjoy the alumni game."
Dwight,What?
Dwight,"Good, we have a deal?"
Jim,"Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine."
Jim,Thanks Janet.
Dwight,How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
Dwight,Thanks so much Earl.
Harry,Nothing?
Jim,"Wow, simultaneous sale."
Jim,"I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?"
Dwight,And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!
Harry,"I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like... a plane. One sale, I'm out."
Jim,Screw â€˜em.
Jim,That sounds lovely.
Andy,Lot going on guys. What's happening?
Harry,"Anyway, Robert's gonna run this company into the ground, so... We won't be doing this in six months."
Jim,Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy,"That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo."
Jim,"Hey, hey, come on, language."
Dwight,"Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes."
Jim,In the fridge.
Dwight,"No, Jim, the butt, in his butt."
Jim,"Sorry, man, I can't focus on zingers. There's too many potential clients."
Stanley,You two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis,"Yeah, the Syracuse branch can't be happy you're taking New York clients."
Robert,Shh... shh...
Jim,Robert?
Oscar,Why did Binghamton close?
Robert,"Can everyone just, please... I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and â€“ how should I say this â€“ Columbian whites. What â€“ what is this about, uh, Binghamton?"
Kevin,The branch closed. Forever.
Robert,"Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I'm not gonna start doubting my drunken self now."
Nellie,I got your voicemail. From â€“ from last night.
Robert,Wonderful.
Nellie,"And the answer... is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never."
Robert,"Pam, when's the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn't hold the memories in?"
Pam,"Oh, it was this summer â€“"
Robert,"Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said."
Pam,"Um, I am a little busy."
Robert,"Yes, â€˜course. Why don't you list the things that would keep you from helping me."
Pam,"Yeah, I can make you a list."
Robert,Let's do it now. What's number one?
Pam,Why don't I help you now?
Robert,There we go.
Pam,Okay.
Harry,Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Erin,"Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?"
Dwight,And you are...
Harry,"Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse."
Harry,What the hell's all this?
Andy,"Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato."
Harry,"You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy?"
Jim,"The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it."
Dwight,Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to â€“ how do I put this â€“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Jim,"Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money."
Dwight,Yes.
Jim,Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.
Dwight,There he is. That's Lloyd.
Toby,Me?
Creed,"Yeah, you."
Harry,Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby,"Now, we're actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe."
Toby,"I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn't back down from anybody. And he calls people ""Kimosabe""."
Harry,They're New York. We're New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been.
Jim,There's actually not a rule that says that.
Dwight,That's true.
Toby,"That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?"
Toby,No.
Dwight,"Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now."
Harry,Stay out of my state. It's in your best interest to stay out of my state.
Toby,I've seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Harry,"Just stay out of New York, Lloyd."
Toby,"Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that."
Jim,How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Harry,"Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that."
Dwight,"Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg."
Robert,"Where's the Advil, Jim? I think I've hit my limit on the Tylenol â€“ Oh."
Andy,"Sorry, not Jim."
Robert,"Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?"
Andy,Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Robert,"Oh, for god â€“"
Harry,Robert California. What a surprise you're here in Scranton.
Robert,Harry...
Harry,So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Robert,How do you mean?
Andy,"I forgot, a... a pan, uh â€“"
Harry,"No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead."
Robert,"Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed."
Dwight,"Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say."
Harry,"Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions â€“"
Dwight,Don't listen to him.
Harry,Used to be Binghamton's â€“
Dwight,Nope.
Harry,"I want it, it's mine."
Dwight,"Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert."
Harry,We need you to make a decision.
Dwight,Make a decision.
Robert,I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said...
Andy,"Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all."
Robert,"Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I'll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one."
Harry,Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? I'm gonna get some air.
Dwight,"Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first."
Jim,He's running!
Dwight,Damn it!
Jim,Damn it.
Dwight,Wha â€“ what is this supposed to be?
Jim,It's a monkey.
Dwight,"Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose."
Jim,"Hold on, hold on. Is this him?"
Dwight,What?
Jim,Is that him?
Dwight,It's him! Do something! Get out!
Jim,What? What am I gonna do? I don't â€“
Dwight,"Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay."
Jim,Dwight!
Dwight,"Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos."
Jim,Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight,Yeah.
Jim,"Oh, yeah, definitely have nos."
Dwight,Hit the nos.
Jim,Are you sure?
Dwight,Yes.
Jim,Brace yourself. 3... 2...
Dwight,Got it. Go.
Jim,1. Here we go!
Andy,Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Receptionist,"Oh, do you have an appointment?"
Andy,"No, I do not."
Receptionist,"Okay, I think I can squeeze you in."
Andy,"Seriously? â€˜Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you."
Receptionist,He's really not that busy.
Mr. Ramish,Is there someone here to see me?
Receptionist,"Yes, this man."
Mr. Ramish,Come on in.
Pam,"So...what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?"
Nellie,"Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does."
Angela,
Angela,
Angela,
Gabe,Did someone say girl talk?
Gabe,"Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk."
Gabe,"Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I'm pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines."
Nellie,"Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?"
Gabe,"Uh, I think you're gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. It'll be upsetting if you don't."
Andy,I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Mr. Ramish,Why haven't I heard of you? You got any references?
Andy,No. I'm a rogue.
Mr. Ramish,Uh-huh.
Andy,Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now... I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Mr. Ramish,Every salesman I've ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Andy,"Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house. Whatever you need â€“ anytime, night or day â€“ you just stop on by."
Mr. Ramish,You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
Andy,Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Dwight,"Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
Dwight,Ahhh!
Jim,You all right?
Dwight,Yeah. Oh.
Jim,Ah!
Jim,"Dwight, what are you doing?"
Dwight,"Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!"
Jim,What are you talking about?
Dwight,Just run! Take the stairs!
Jim,I don't even know where the stairs are!
Dwight,I'll stall him. Go!
Jim,God!
Harry,What are you doing?
Dwight,I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. Oh. My pants fell down.
Jim,What?
Dwight,My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
Dwight,"Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton."
Mr. Ramish,What's going on?
Dwight,Well â€“
Harry,"Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse â€“"
Dwight,I was here first.
Mr. Ramish,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay."
Dwight,I already made an appointment... with your secretary.
Mr. Ramish,Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier.
Dwight,"Wait, it's not D.M Utica, is it?"
Mr. Ramish,"No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It's... Big Red Paper Company."
Jim,Big Red Paper Company?
Mr. Ramish,Mm-hmm.
Andy,"Yes, yes, yes!"
Harry,Give me a cup of coffee.
Dwight,Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Jim,"All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these."
Dwight,No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
Harry,"You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?"
Dwight,Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
Jim,But you're saying there's a chance.
Dwight,Shut up.
Pam,Hey.
Robert,Hmm.
Pam,I stole Nellie's phone.
Robert,Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam,What do you want from me?
Robert,"Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's ""yes, yes, yes, yes, never."""
Phone,"Hi, Nell, it's mom. Do keep your chin up. It can't be as bad as you described."
Robert,Oh yes it can.
Phone,"This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections."
Robert,Shopaholic.
Pam,Sounds like it.
Robert,Yeah.
Phone,"Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?"
Robert,Ah.
Phone,"This is Annie from second nests. I'm sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we're gonna hold out for that."
Pam,"Okay, that's enough."
Robert,"Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this."
Pam,"No, no, no!"
Robert,"No, come on."
Pam,"Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted."
Robert,"Pam, Pam, you've completely bungled this!"
Pam,Ah. Ahh.
Pam,Hey.
Oscar,"Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-"
Robert,"Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis."
Phyllis,What's he doing?
David,Pleasure.
Dwight,He's searching out younger gays.
Robert,I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
Phyllis,Oh.
David,"That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that."
Oscar,"No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead."
Robert,Please.
Dwight,...with you.
Andy,Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Oscar,"No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-"
Jim,Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Kelly,Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Andy,"Gosh, I hope so."
Oscar,Do you not own a mirror?
Angela,"No! God, Mose! God!"
Kelly,Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Mose,"Hi, Angela."
Pam,"I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things."
Angela,Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Kelly,I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Mose,I'm not supposed to say.
Oscar,"Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-"
Angela,"Yes! Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!"
Robert,"No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-"
Darryl,Let's see that smile. Go on.
Oscar,It's not misleading.
Val,Right here?
Robert,"-pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as ""normal."" It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated."
Darryl,Cool.
Kevin,"Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. Ooh!"
Andy,Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
Robert,"Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!"
Nellie,May I say one thing?
Dwight,"You okay, Robert?"
Andy,It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
Robert,Fine.
Nellie,The quality of mercy is not strained.
Dwight,Put some ice on it.
Andy,No.
Oscar,"In any case, it gets better. Maybe- maybe not much better... but better."
Nellie,It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Sasha,"One, two, three!"
Andy,Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
Dwight,"I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, ""muffin basket."" Then I thought, ""What's even more precious to people than muffins?"""
Nellie,It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Jake,"Can you just smile, please?"
Andy,I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
Meredith,I don't want to!
Andy,If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Dwight,...their own children.
Nellie,"Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want."
Dwight,"Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?"
Andy,"All right, you sly b*st*rd. When can you start?"
Angela,No thank you.
David,"Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him."
Dwight,"Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them."
Meredith,Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
Jim,"I know why you're doing this, Dwight."
David,"But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important."
Jim,"Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest."
Robert,"David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women."
Dwight,"Wha-? Damn it, Jim!"
David,I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Jim,Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Robert,"Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom."
Darryl,Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Andy,Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
Hide,Bad economy. Bad investment.
Robert,"Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun."
Darryl,You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Andy,Mm. Mm-hmm.
Calvin,They did not.
Robert,It's been a great year.
Darryl,And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Dwight,Hello.
Calvin,I wouldn't.
Angela,Where is it?
Darryl,"Aw, come on. What's the harm? Mmm. What flavor was that?"
Dwight,They're testing it now.
Hide,Coconut pen1s.
Angela,How long does it take to get the results?
Darryl,The coconut's pretty subtle.
Dwight,Seventy-two hours.
Calvin,"Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no?"
Angela,You're gonna wait here?
Darryl,"I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- ooh, hold on a second. Oh."
Dwight,Yes.
Darryl,"If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself."
Angela,"Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!"
Andy,Hi guys.
Senator Lipton,Hey.
Jim,"How's it going, man?"
Oscar,"Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?"
Andy,"I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?"
Senator Lipton,You didn't call.
Jim,"Great, yeah, good."
Oscar,"Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me..."
Gabe,"Oh, how the mediocre have fallen."
Senator Lipton,You know what this is about. Call.
Nellie,Oh God.
Andy,"Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants..."
Nellie,"No, you don't understand-"
Andy,Clean the toilets.
Nellie,I don't need anyone to-
Andy,Pull the poop out of the toilets.
Nellie,That's not even a thing.
Andy,"Just, please..."
Nellie,Andy.
Andy,Please!
Nellie,Andy.
Andy,Give me something!
Nellie,Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
Andy,Thank you.
Nellie,You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Andy,Thank you.
Nellie,You don't need to-
Andy,I have a delicious secret.
Creed,"Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping."
Jim,Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Andy,"Yeah, it is actually."
Andy,"Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager."
Pam,Family picture!
Jim,Pam? No!
Pam,"What? Honey, we talked about this."
Jim,"No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap."
Pam,"Yes, and then we decided that was crazy."
Jim,"No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it."
Pam,"No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?"
Jim,Nope.
Pam,We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
Jim,But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
Pam,"No, no."
Jim,Nope.
Pam,But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Jim,That's-
Pam,Yes!
Jim,That's-
Pam,And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Jim,Okay.
Kevin,"Wait, C-R-A-Z..."
Dwight,"Great, right up there."
Pam,Yeah?
Jim,Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,Alright. Why don't you just-
Pam,"Oh, great. Thank you."
Jim,#NAME?
Pam,Okay.
Jim,This is great.
Pam,You ready?
Jim,Excuse me.
Pam,There we go.
Jim,Just do it.
Pam,I'll just stand here?
Jim,"Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great."
Photographer,"Sir, could you look into the camera?"
Jim,"Let's do it, shoot it."
Photographer,Sir.
Jim,Great.
Dwight,Up here.
Jim,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Dwight,"Jim, right here, right here. Okay, good."
Jim,"Oh, so that's it?"
Dwight,That's it.
Pam,See? That wasn't so hard.
Dwight,"Cute kids, thanks for coming."
Senator Lipton,"Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody."
Angela,"Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?"
Senator Lipton,"Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op."
Phyllis,Yeah.
Angela,Heh.
Erin,"Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line."
Senator Lipton,Thanks.
Dwight,"Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela."
Angela,Dwight.
Dwight,Nice to see you. May I hold him?
Senator Lipton,Sure.
Angela,No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
Angela,"I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with."
Angela,See the duckie!
Dwight,"Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place."
Senator Lipton,"Oh, thank you."
Angela,No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Dwight,Really?
Andy,This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. It's go time.
Andy,"Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup."
Nellie,"Well, I don't want any soup."
Andy,But it's really good- Oh!
Nellie,"Oh come on, Andy!"
Erin,I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Andy,A delicious moment.
Erin,"But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake."
Andy,"Well, but it-"
Erin,Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Dwight,"Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-"
Angela,"Uh-uh, leave us alone."
Senator Lipton,I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
Dwight,"Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?"
Angela,"Dwight, we're fine!"
Senator Lipton,"Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?"
Angela,Oh no.
Senator Lipton,I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
Dwight,"He defecated, aw."
Senator Lipton,You're stinky.
Darryl,"A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?"
Brandon,"That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that."
Val,"Uh, Brandon?"
Darryl,I would.
Brandon,You would?
Darryl,Yeah.
Brandon,Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.
Val,"Calm down, he's not."
Darryl,"Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page."
Brandon,So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
Val,Brandon!
Darryl,Good slam.
Brandon,"Thank you, Biggie."
Darryl,Good luck to you.
Brandon,"Oh, and have a burger for me."
Senator Lipton,"Okay, shall we take a few more?"
Angela,"I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight."
Senator Lipton,Okay. There we go.
Angela,No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
Dwight,Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Toby,"Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you."
Nellie,"You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably."
Andy,I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Jim,"No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk..."
Erin,"No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me."
Nellie,What?
Pam,You hit her?
Andy,No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
Erin,"He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-"
Andy,"That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest."
Gabe,Happy birthday to Gabe!
Nellie,"Oh, get out, skeleton man!"
Toby,I can refer you to someone to talk to.
Andy,Huh? Hold on.
Toby,Give you a name or-
Andy,"I just gonna- quick- Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!"
Jim,Oh boy.
Pam,"Oh, Andy."
Oscar,What?
Andy,I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
Oscar,David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Andy,"Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum ""Suck It"" to the U.S. military."
Jim,"Andy, come on."
Kevin,Even I know that's weird.
Andy,"I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy."
Toby,"Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy."
Andy,Stop saying my name.
Erin,"No, he's not making this up."
Andy,"Thank you, Erin."
Erin,Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Pam,But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Erin,Oh my God.
Andy,"Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace."
Toby,Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
Dwight,Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
Kelly,"Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there."
Ravi,I do adore you.
Robert,"Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this."
Andy,"Yeah, I know."
Robert,"Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. Why'd they add coconut? I miss original."
Jim,Hey.
Others,Hey!
David,"Hey guys, long time."
Pam,"David, what are you doing here?"
Phyllis,Is it true you're buying the company?
David,"Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-"
Andy,What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
David,"I'll get to that in a second, Andy."
Andy,But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
David,"Yes, as we've discussed-"
Andy,What?
David,But it's very possible-
Andy,Oh my God!
David,Probable.
Andy,Wow. From janitor to manager?
David,Yep.
Andy,That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
David,"There's an official announcement, a few details to be-"
Andy,"From total loss to total boss, I mean-"
Stanley,Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
David,"Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-"
Andy,I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Phyllis,So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
David,"Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company."
Robert,Oof. Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. I'm actually the CEO.
David,"Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there."
Robert,"Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess."
David,"Well, okay. Great to meet you."
Erin,"Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time."
Dwight,"How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news."
Doctor,"Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father."
Angela,I told you
Kevin,"Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles."
Oscar,That piece doesn't go there.
Kevin,"So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time."
Pam,"For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great."
Jim,You are really good at modesty. She's a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 childrenâ€”
Pam,"Kay, well, you had that interesting thing."
Jim,"Oh, yeah"
Pam,"Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college."
Jim,Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
Pam,And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
Jim,"In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea."
Pam,He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.
Jim,An Altima or better.
Toby,Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiancÃ© Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
Kelly,I don't need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
Toby,"Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it"
Kelly,Enjoy the snow losers.
Erin,I'm so happy for you Kelly.
Toby,"Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons."
Ryan,"I've actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town. And, uh, that's not garbage, it's out clothes."
Pam,And that was our summer.
Jim,we good?
Off-camera,Yeah
Pam,"Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company."
Off-camera,"Well we're more following you guys, to see how you turn out."
Pam,"Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time."
Erin,Andy's coming back today!
Clark,"Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?"
Stanley,"Oh, my god. It's called a garbage can."
Phyllis,Helpless.
Toby,There's two new guys back there with me now. They're in their 20s. And we really get along.
Clark,You're looking good.
Toby,Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
Stanley,They're like the new Jim and Dwight.
Nellie,"Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect."
Meredith,"Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face."
Pete,No thank you. My name's Pete.
Jim,"No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim."
Erin,"Andy's here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy's here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here. Pam, he's here."
Andy,"Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!"
Nellie,"It sounds amazing, tell us all about it."
Andy,What're you still doing here?
Nellie,"Wonderful, thanks."
Andy,You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
Nellie,Brilliant.
Andy,"See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, umâ€”"
Pete,Pete!
Andy,In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
Pete,What? Why?
Andy,Cause you're always taking dumps.
Pete,No I'm not.
Andy,"Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time."
Clark,I love it.
Darryl,"Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr."
Clark,"No, I prefer Fart."
Andy,"No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane."
Dwight,I don't see it.
Clark,I don't either.
Andy,"Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?"
Dwight,"Yes, yes I am."
Andy,"Dwight, Jr!"
Dwight,In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.
Angela,"Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption."
Kevin,"The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?"
Kevin,"Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin."
Angela,"No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look. He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants"
Kevin,I'll take him.
Angela,"Please, after the turtle?"
Kevin,I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
Angela,"Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?"
Oscar,"No, I'm a dog person."
Angela,"If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person."
Oscar,"Those guys always change back, Angela."
Andy,"David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm."
David,Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
Toby,Hey you wanted to see me?
Andy,"Yeah, I gotta go David. Why is Nellie still here?"
Toby,You can only fire Nellie for cause.
Andy,"Mm, then I will make up a cause."
Toby,"Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you."
Andy,Then forget I just told you that.
Toby,Can't. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
Andy,Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
Dwight,"Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!"
Clark,"Yep, body by Cheez-it"
Dwight,"Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?"
Clark,I think I'm busy that night. Or I would.
Dwight,"Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?"
Clark,Learning what?
Dwight,"Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head."
Clark,Kay.
Dwight,"So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?"
Clark,"Is thisâ€”is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies."
Dwight,Spoken like a true root man.
Clark,"You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you."
Dwight,My calls?
Clark,So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet?
Dwight,You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Clark,"Yeah, I'll just give it a glanceâ€”"
Dwight,Ok
Clark,I'll give it a read.
Dwight,With my leads and stuff like that?
Clark,Yeah.
Dwight,Cause you're interested in going into sales?
Clark,I am.
Dwight,"Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?"
Clark,Ok.
Dwight,You're not getting my clients! Nice try.
Dwight,"Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job."
Dwight,"Jim, get ready for the battle of your life."
Jim,Done. Explain.
Dwight,The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Jim,"Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday."
Dwight,"Wait, salesâ€”what sales meeting?"
Jim,The new guys called one.
Dwight,The new guys called a sales meeting?
Jim,Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
Dwight,There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Jim,You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. Too easy.
Angela,Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no.
Oscar,Definitely no.
Angela,"Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I'm fine with either, but not both. Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, ok?"
Andy,I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.
Nellie,Not necessarily
Andy,"No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you."
Andy,Now this is called slack lining.
Andy,"I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb."
Andy,"If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather."
Rafe,Iceman.
Andy,"That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack."
Jim,You a sports fan?
Pete,"Sure, boxing, tennis."
Jim,Oh. Any team sports?
Pete,NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
Jim,"Phillies fan, though, right?"
Pete,You mean horses?
Jim,"No, like baseball. A baseball team."
Pete,"Ah, I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont."
Jim,Ok. Good talk.
Jim,I have nothing in common with Plop.
Andy,"All right, who's next? Nellie?"
Nellie,"Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends."
Andy,Nonsense. Get up here.
Kevin,Go ahead
Andy,"Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?"
Nellie,I'm very self-conscious about my feet.
Andy,"Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?"
Darryl,This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Andy,Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
Clark,"Uh, I guess I could give it shot."
Andy,"Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up."
Clark,Ok
Andy,Focus on the horizon. Whoa! Look at this guy.
Clark,I've always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
Darryl,"Go, Dwight Jr!"
Andy,"Hey, yes."
Dwight,"Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!"
Clark,"Alright, let's see you do it."
Andy,Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Andy,Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
Dwight,"Ok, I am just getting started, ok?"
Clark,"You got this, it's all you. Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It's not a race, Dwight."
Andy,Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
Dwight,That's not true. Just give me another chance.
Oscar,But your mouth is bleâ€”
Toby,"This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this."
Dwight,What?
Toby,"It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work."
Dwight,This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Idiots.
Dwight,"Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!"
Pam,Dwight!
Dwight,"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on."
Pam,What are you doing?
Dwight,"Come here, I'll show you."
Angela,Why do you want this cat?
Pete,"I don't want it, really."
Angela,How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
Pete,"I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night."
Angela,Have you taken any concrete steps?
Pete,"Well, I'm still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list."
Jim,"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim."
Dwight,Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
Pam,I will?
Dwight,"You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?"
Pam,"Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds."
Dwight,So you'll do it?
Pam,No.
Dwight,"Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life."
Pam,"Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life."
Dwight,Come on.
Pam,Exactly the way it is.
Dwight,"No, Pam."
Pam,"Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it."
Dwight,"Please? Please, Pam?"
Pam,"Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis."
Dwight,"I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive."
Pete,Why are you getting rid of it?
Angela,Allergies.
Pete,Your husband?
Angela,"No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night."
Oscar,You know what? I will take Comstock.
Angela,"Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!"
Oscar,I'll come by after work and pick him up.
Angela,"Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight"
Oscar,C'est la vie.
Angela,Please don't teach the cat French.
Oscar,"Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock."
Pam,You ready?
Jim,Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Pam,Kay.
Dwight,"Ok.Oh, god."
Dwight,"Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!"
Jim,"Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah!"
Dwight,Woo! Ahh!!
Creed,"In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator"
Meredith,"Crap. Sorry, Nellie."
Nellie,"Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we wouldâ€”"
Stanley,"Mm, swish."
Nellie,"Oh, it's nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are."
Andy,There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
Nellie,Fluke.
Pam,"The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel."
Dwight,"No, no. No spoilers. Please."
Kevin,"Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?"
Darryl,My bad.
Pam,"Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and... you see what chore you get that day."
Dwight,No.
Kevin,A wheel is supposed to spin.
Darryl,Goodnight.
Erin,"Yeah, you know, like guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh... guh."
Clark,Hey! Everybody.
Pam,"No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-"
Andy,Yeah.
Andy,"Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores."
Clark,Come in.
Creed,"A wheel wants to spin, Pam."
Andy,All right!
Jim,Spinning would be more fun.
Clark,Come on in.
Pam,â€˜Kay.
Andy,Nice.
Kevin,"Okay, that's what I'm talking about! Big money, big money! Mug duty?"
Clark,What're you doing here?
Pam,"Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink."
Pete,"Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied."
Kevin,This sucks.
Erin,The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Erin,"Yeah, seriously, it's like everything on there is work."
Andy,"Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen."
Pam,I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's-
Erin,"Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked."
Kevin,"Yeah, I don't think that you understand wheels."
Andy,He sure did.
Pam,"I've been through several rounds of development with the team and here's where we stand with the chore wheel. We've got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right"
Clark,"All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody."
Pam,The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute no one seems to mind.
Erin,Aw!
Pam,Toilets!
Andy,"Just, you sure Clark?"
Jim,"Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma's got breakfast, OK? We are going to Roy's wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife's ex-fiancÃ©'s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it's your wife's ex-fiancÃ©."
Clark,"Yep, she's done."
Pam,"Thanks, mom!"
Andy,"No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that."
Jim,A banana?
Clark,"No, we got it. We got it."
Pam,Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs.
Erin,Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
Jim,"Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding."
Andy,"I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing."
Pam,Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
Clark,"OK, I don't."
Jim,Just... so weird.
Andy,All right.
Erin,"Oh, Pete, you've got mail."
Erin,I'm hungry.
Pete,Really? I got something?
Andy,"Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?"
Erin,"Well, it's addressed to Customer Service so, it's your mail."
Pete,"Yeah, whatever you say, boss."
Clark,"Well, you know, I'm also Customer Service."
Andy,OK. I'll call you later.
Erin,"Yeah, I'm alternating."
Erin,OK.
Pete,"Yay, another person yelling at me."
Andy,So this is a single.
Erin,"Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time."
Erin,"Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy."
Pete,That's really nice.
Dwight,Oh god.
Clark,"Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election... thing is crazy, right?"
Nellie,That is absolutely revolting!
Pete,It's open.
Dwight,Yeah.
Erin,"Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It's not a nice letter."
Nellie,"He is so good, though."
Pete,OK.
Dwight,Yes.
Nellie,Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
Nellie,The way he just cuts off his arm.
Creed,I know you don't really exist.
Dwight,"If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes."
Nellie,"Today, I launch my big charity initiative â€˜Operation Give Back'. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I'd like to see him piss on that one."
Nellie,"Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time."
Roy,Darryl! Ha-ha! What's happening?
Dwight,Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Darryl,"Congratulations, baby!"
Nellie,"Well, it doesn't make you stupid."
Roy,"Ah, thank you!"
Dwight,"Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid."
Jim,Is this his house?
Nellie,Stupid like you.
Pam,Think so.
Dwight,"No, like you."
Server,Mimosa?
Nellie,Like you.
Pam,Thank you.
Dwight,You're the stupid one.
Server,Would you like me to take your peel?
Nellie,You're the stupid one.
Pam,"Yes, thank you."
Dwight,You're the stupid one.
Jim,OK.
Nellie,You're the stupid one.
Pam,Who's that?
Dwight,"You, you, you, you..."
Jim,"Uh, my ex-fiancÃ©."
Pam,Ha-ha.
Jim,"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn't know. Um... actually I did tell Pam and we decided â€˜no'. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be."
Nellie,"With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports."
Kevin,Oh boy! What's happening?
Nellie,"There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?"
Stanley,American Diabetes Association.
Angela,"Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?"
Toby,"I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-"
Kevin,"Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank."
Creed,"I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes."
Nellie,"Dwight, what about you?"
Dwight,I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Andy,"Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives."
Nellie,"Thank you, Andy."
Andy,I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Nellie,"Dwight, you will be participating."
Dwight,No thank you.
Nellie,Participation is mandatory
Dwight,"Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation."
Nellie,"Great, thank you."
Dwight,Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
Nellie,"Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight."
Dwight,Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
Creed,"The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though."
Nellie,"Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back."
Dwight,"Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome."
Jim,"There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?"
Roy,"Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice."
Jim,"Thanks for inviting us, by the way-"
Roy,Are you kidding?
Jim,"That was, that was a surprise."
Roy,"Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. Just kidding."
Jim,You're welcome.
Roy,Thanks...aw.
Jim,"By the way, man, this place is... beautiful."
Roy,"Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?"
Jim,Gravel company?
Roy,Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
Jim,"Not gravel, obviously. No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-"
Roy,"Oh, cool."
Jim,"Yeah, you never know."
Kenny,"Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers."
Jim,"OK, Kenny."
Clark,"Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. Erin, do you know anybody that might want... Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?"
Erin,"Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad."
Clark,"Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind."
Pete,"Uh, is it Duncan?"
Clark,He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
Erin,"You mean, put me on the news?"
Clark,"You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. What do you say? Huh?"
Erin,"Maybe, ok? Let me think about it."
Clark,Ok.
Erin,Whoo!
Clark,Think it over.
Pete,"No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them."
Erin,"I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?"
Roy,"So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you."
Jim,He plays piano?
Pam,No. Roy? No.
Roy,"You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it."
Darryl,"You got this, Roy."
Pam,We still surprise each other.
Jim,Definitely.
Pam,"You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-"
Jim,Courtside seats. Sixers.
Pam,"Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-"
Jim,It was an away game.
Pam,"In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. Do we know everything about each other?"
Jim,No.
Pam,Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
Jim,"Um, ok."
Jim,"Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-"
Pam,And you thought you guys were millionaires.
Jim,You heard that one.
Pam,"Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember."
Jim,That I thought we were millionaires.
Pam,"Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one."
Jim,That's all right.
Angela,The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next.
Jim,You all right?
Nellie,You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Dwight,Anything else would be inconsistent.
Nellie,Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office?
Dwight,"Absolutely, I will."
Dwight,I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. You don't have a plan.
Nellie,"When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan."
Nellie,Looking for this?
Dwight,What the?
Nellie,"Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it."
Dwight,Gimme that.
Nellie,"Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off."
Dwight,You're insane.
Nellie,"I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity."
Dwight,"Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you."
Nellie,"In that case, you... will have to chop off my hand."
Dwight,"This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most."
Nellie,"I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands."
Dwight,Sounds like a plan.
Andy,Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
Erin,Yeah.
Andy,"Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?"
Clark,"Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut."
Andy,Really?
Clark,"Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back."
Pete,Seems unnecessary for an audition.
Clark,"And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-"
Andy,"Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff."
Clark,I absolutely will do that.
Andy,Awesome. Plop!
Clark,"Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits."
Pete,"That Clark, huh? Errr Ca!"
Oscar,Next question for our oldie-weds-
Kevin,What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Angela,Language.
Phyllis,Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
Oscar,Pam's first celebrity crush.
Toby,John Stamos.
Jim,Ready?
Pam,Uh-huh.
Jim,John Stamos.
Angela,Oh!
Pam,Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
Toby,Johnny Depp.
Pam,Johnny Depp.
Toby,"Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp."
Kevin,Totally. George Clooney.
Toby,Uh-huh.
Angela,"OK, I have one. I have one."
Kevin,What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Angela,"Kevin, stop it with that question."
Jim,"Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!"
Jim,It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
Pam,I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
Darryl,"Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence."
Andy,Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. Good. Great job.
Darryl,Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
Andy,Erin has an audition to be a newscaster.
Andy,"Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl."
Darryl,"OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color."
Andy,"Yeah, right?"
Jim,I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
Andy,Yeah.
Oscar,Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
Andy,News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
Oscar,"I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite."
Meredith,"Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride."
Oscar,"Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or..."
Angela,Has she done the pageant circuit?
Erin,"No, I watch the news."
Andy,She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
Erin,"This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job."
Clark,Whatever it takes.
Pete,"Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard."
Dwight,This is it. Any questions?
Nellie,Is it gonna be long?
Dwight,No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
Erin,"Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented."
Darryl,"Um, where did you get that story?"
Erin,"A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events."
Andy,"I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name."
Erin,"For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon."
Andy,Pause after 'news'.
Erin,For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
Andy,"No, pause longer."
Darryl,That was a good one.
Andy,"Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy."
Erin,Got it. For Channel 11 news...
Andy,"Wha, it's-"
Erin,I'm Erin Hannon.
Andy,OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
Jim,I can feel you looking at me.
Pam,"OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-"
Jim,Uh-huh.
Pam,"I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know."
Jim,That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Pam,"Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me."
Jim,Uh...
Pam,Just tell me.
Jim,"God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well."
Dwight,Heh! Ha!
Pete,"Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team."
Erin,Oh.
Pete,The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
Erin,Oh god.
Pete,"Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera."
Erin,Tuh.
Pete,"Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know."
Dwight,Ha! This is for real this time.
Darryl,It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little inspiration.
Nellie,"Oh, a movie. What is this?"
Darryl,127 hours. It's about this guy who-
Fake Jim,"Morning, Dwight"
Nellie,"This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich."
Dwight,Who are you?
Nellie,And Filipino. But we'll break that to her later.
Fake Jim,"Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight."
Nellie,You know what this is all about.
Dwight,You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
Darryl,"Yeah. You too, huh?"
Fake Jim,"You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race."
Nellie,"Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!"
Dwight,"Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?"
Darryl,Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too. Yeah.
Fake Jim,"Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me."
Nellie,"Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this."
Voicemail,Please enter your password.
Jim,I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
Voicemail,You have one new message.
Pam,I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
Dwight,"How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!"
Pam,I was helping Nellie driveâ€”
Fake Jim,"Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work."
Stanley,Do not care.
Dwight,You don't work here! You're not Jim!
Pete,Fonas chek!
Pam,"Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico's at 7"
Erin,Dothraas! chek!
Fake Jim,"Oh great, can't wait."
Andy,I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
Pam,Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
Erin,Hmmm!
Dwight,"I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!"
Dwight,"Oh myâ€”! Oh dâ€”! Oh, how didâ€”? Huhhhhh!"
Erin,Heyyy! Study buddies!
Darryl,"Oh, ok."
Erin,Getting things done. Awesome!
Darryl,"It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!"
Darryl,"Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let's knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament."
Erin,"S""il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh!"
Dwight,"Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat."
Erin,I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
Dwight,You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Dwight,"Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads."
Dwight,I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
Erin,Yeah! Let's do it!
Dwight,Atherozar!
Erin,Oh!
Dwight,"It means ""excellent"". And we have begun."
Pam,. Is everything okay?
Nellie,"Hmm? Ohâ€”oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'm mean, I dâ€”I just don't wannaâ€”burden you with my massive stress freak outs!"
Pam,Great.
Nellie,"It's just that I am taking my driver's license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ""Demandy"".... I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But...in who's car?"
Andy,Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
Nellie,
Pam,"Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime."
Nellie,"Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!"
Nellie and Pam,ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Pam,"I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch."
Jim,Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Nellie,This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Andy,Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
Nellie,"Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!"
Andy,As in...
Nellie,"Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children."
Andy,Wow!
Andy,This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
Andy,"My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama."
Erin,"I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ""What's your stance on politics?"" Or, ""What is the best war to do?"" And, I will just be like, ""Duhhhh!"""
Andy,"Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama."
Pete,"Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm."
Clark,So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
Clark,Oooohhhhhhhh!
Clark,"It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome."
Pete,"Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point."
Clark,"Just clap through it, man."
Darryl,"You log in sales at ten different times. If you log â€˜em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching."
Jim,"That was really good, Darryl."
Darryl,"Life hacking, man."
Andy,There he is!
Jim,"Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed meâ€”."
Andy,"Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?"
Darryl,"Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross."
Andy,It's me! I am related to Michelle Obama.
Darryl,What?! Really?
Andy,"I mean, it's distant, but..."
Darryl,"Huh ha! That's cool, man."
Andy,Right?
Andy,"Darryl said, ""Cool, man."" He called me as cool man."
Pam,"You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat."
Nellie,"Mmmmâ€”the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I'm driving, so, I might as well get good at it."
Pam,Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Nellie,Whhooooo!
Oscar,"I'm just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?"
Phyllis,You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
Stanley,Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
Dwight,I throat-rip.
Erin,Foth aggendak!
Dwight,You throat-rip.
Erin,Foth aggendi!
Dwight,He/she/it throat rips.
Erin,Foth aggenda!
Dwight,"More of a, barbaric growl."
Erin,Forth aggenda!
Dwight,Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse!
Erin,Wah!! Aggenda!!
Pam,"Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?"
Nellie,Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!
Pam,What?
Nellie,"Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately."
Pam,Sure.
Nellie,"Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!"
Pam,So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
Nellie,"Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer."
Pam,
Pam,Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Nellie,Pam!.
Pam,
Oscar,"Well, if there's another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. Iâ€”"
Andy,"What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work!."
Oscar,Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Andy,Why? Is it employee's day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
Oscar,"Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family wereâ€”slave owners."
Andy,Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
Darryl,Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Andy,"Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye."
Darryl,"Yes, yes, yes."
Andy,"Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!"
Darryl,I included some time saving ideas...
Andy,"Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now."
Darryl,"Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird."
Andy,"Right on, brotha. Wurddd."
Erin,Addor!
Dwight,Daraas!
Erin,Qazer!
Dwight,Daraas! Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
Pete,Hey Erin!
Erin,Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
Pete,Ohâ€”okay. Sorry.
Nellie,"Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work."
Pam,"Yeahâ€”turn signal. It's exciting to be painting againâ€”those are the wipers. Soâ€”theâ€”itsâ€”just. There you go! Yeah. Yeah, things get so busy with the kidsâ€”red lightâ€”that it's nice to have that creative outletâ€”red light! Red light! Red! Red!"
Nellie,"That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work."
Pam,"Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby."
Nellie,"That's amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!"
Pam,Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
Andy,". Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?"
Erin,Vos!
Andy,"So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today."
Erin,Because of your slaves.
Andy,"Not my slaves, my ancestors'. Maybe. Probably not."
Erin,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ""slave master"", ""attafrauk!"", is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?"
Andy,That you're learning a made-up language from HBO's Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
Erin,"Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language."
Dwight,"People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it."
Andy,Hi guys.
Phyllis,Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Andy,Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
Andy,"Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to beâ€”. Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"" by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smithâ€”African Americanâ€”Mambazo."
Pam,"Good. Very good.Ohâ€”no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ""New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P."" And then in parentheses, he wrote out ""as soon as possible."""
Nellie,"Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ""looking for dirt."""
Pam,"Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding."
Nellie,"Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding."
Pam,Ohâ€”geeâ€”I'mâ€”
Nellie,No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! I love it.
Pam,Brilliant!
Nellie,What should we say about Jim?
Pam,Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
Nellie,My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. I just made a joke there.
Pam,"I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there's something Jim isn't telling me."
Nellie,Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
Pam,Jim? No.
Nellie,. How can you be sure?
Pam,Because he just loves me too much.
Nellie,"You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?"
Andy,"I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States."
Angela,Ew.
Andy,Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
Kevin,And John Wayne?
Andy,No. Not that I see here.
Kevin,Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
Andy,"You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!"
Jim,"Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. Trueâ€” Oh no."
Andy,Dwight's grandfather was aâ€”.
Dwight,Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So...
Andy,I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
Dwight,"Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!"
Andy,And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
Meredith,Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Angela,Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
Phyllis,"Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?"
Kevin,"Yeah, thatâ€”you're being really mean, Andy."
Dwight,"Yeah, Andy."
Andy,"No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it."
Oscar,"The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did."
Andy,Might've done. And how... do you figure?
Oscar,Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Andy,"You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income."
Oscar,Really?
Andy,"We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen."
Andy,"Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had."
Darryl,You're gonna po' mouth
Andy,"Exactly. Help me po' mouth, Darryl."
Darryl,"Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestionsâ€”"
Andy,"What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?"
Darryl,That could work.
Andy,"You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here."
Darryl,I'm going for a walk.
Andy,Okay.
Pam,Good. Good. Andâ€”
Jim,"You doing alright, man?"
Darryl,I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
Jim,Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Darryl,"It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets."
Jim,"Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?"
Darryl,Hmm. Yeah right
Jim,"No, I'm serious. There's always something better."
Darryl,Like what?
Jim,Like hypothetically... if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Darryl,What kind of job?
Jim,"Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?"
Darryl,Hell yeah!
Jim,Right?
Darryl,That sounds awesome!
Jim,"Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to..."
Darryl,I love Philly!
Jim,Right?
Darryl,It's not even a thoughtâ€”
Jim,Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Darryl,"What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?"
Jim,"Oh, it's happening! Let's just keep it between you and me for right now."
Darryl,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it?"
Jim,"We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she'sâ€”I think she understands... what this is."
Darryl,"Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real."
Jim,"What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!"
Darryl,It's not real... until your wife is on board.
Pam,So what did you want to show me?
Nellie,"That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?"
Pam,Yeah. It's really ugly
Nellie,"Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking...a mural."
Pam,You mean me?
Nellie,Yes! You! You are soo talented! It's going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton's most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Pam,"Oh my god! I love it! Uh, Iâ€”Nellie, this is brilliant! Hey!"
Jim,Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
Nellie,"Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!"
Pam,What?! No! I-I got this. Okay?
Andy,"Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together."
Meredith,What?
Group,Dunder Mifflin!
Jim,Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Andy,Andy Bernard presents
Dwight,"I'm barren, Jim."
Kevin,That's me.
Jim,What?
Andy,Fail.
Dwight,My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Oscar,Is this like a blooper reel?
Jim,"Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank."
Andy,"A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! Who's this guy?Look at him dance. Fail!"
Dwight,You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Dwight,Fail!
Jim,No.
Jim,I deserved that.
Dwight,That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.
Andy,Do do do do do do do.
Jim,I'll take it.
Darryl,That was a triple.
Nellie,Andy?
Andy,Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
Andy,Who is it?
Darryl,My pleasure.
Nellie,"Um, is this a good time?"
Andy,"Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable."
Video Andy,"Hey, I'm Pete, puberty is such a drag, man. And I'm Clark! I like to eat toilet paper. We fail!"
Nellie,"Oh, why, is there something?"
Andy,"I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year. Well, that's all folks. Ski ya later everybody. Thanks for a great season."
Andy,"It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater."
Oscar,What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Nellie,"Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-"
Andy,"Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?"
Andy,"Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream."
Jim,"Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?"
Nellie,Alright then.
Andy,Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..
Jim,"Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant."
Jim,I think I got it right here.
Dwight,Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
Andy,That was not a fail.
Jim,That doesn't matter.
Group,Fail! Fail! Fail!...
Dwight,What position did you use to conceive?
Andy,That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. You're all failing right now. Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail!
Jim,Ok...that's not...
Dwight,"Oh, god."
Dwight,"Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim."
Phyllis,What's going on?
Andy,British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
Dwight,Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please.
Pete,I don't think that's Nelly.
Stanley,What's he measuring?
Andy,What?
Dwight,"OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please."
Nellie,"Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you."
Toby,It's an EMF hotspot.
Jim,"Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?"
Phyllis,Oh my god!
Dwight,You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Oscar,It stands for electromagnetic field. Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
Jim,"Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin.."
Andy,"Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?"
Dwight,Bildenkinder.
Toby,You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Jim,OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
Andy,"I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?"
Pam,Oh! Hey! How'd it go?
Stanley,Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
Jim,It's pretty good actually.
Dwight,"OK, listen. Everything here is up to code."
Pam,Yeah?
Dwight,"Oh, the wires need insulation. It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat."
Jim,We bonded. We got to-
Pam,Thank you.
Oscar,Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!
Jim,You got it.
Dwight,When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
Jim,"Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! Gotta go through me first."
Pam,You feel OK now?
Nellie,"Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now."
Dwight,"Oh, better than OK. You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie."
Andy,Fine. I will give you one minute.
Pam,"Well, actually, rhubarb is-"
Nellie,"Oh, please don't use the hourglass."
Jim,Don't..
Andy,"You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase."
Pam,the one pie that I don't.
Nellie,I'm trying to adopt a baby.
Jim,Don't..
Andy,A baby what? A human?!
Dwight,Everybody! Hang on!
Nellie,And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
Angela,Oh!
Andy,Oh.
Jim,Pie! Pie! Pie!
Nellie,You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Group,Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie!
Andy,"Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so."
Nellie,Oh.
Nellie,It's not..it's-
Andy,I changed my mind.
Andy,And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
Nellie,"Oh, you signed it?"
Nellie,Well then if I could just convince...
Andy,"Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. Well, yeah, whatever. So."
Andy,And those sand grains are tumbling..
Nellie,"""She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents."""
Nellie,You.
Kevin,"I insult you, Oscar."
Andy,With fury...
Oscar,What?
Nellie,It's not..it's not
Kevin,I insult you! To your face!
Andy,Down the sides..
Oscar,I don't know what you're talking about.
Nellie,Entrapment if I'm..
Kevin,Then why don't you do something about it?
Andy,Of the hourglass..
Oscar,"Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?"
Nellie,..writing..
Kevin,"You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! Yes!"
Andy,Time's up!
Pam,Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed.
Nellie,Fine.
Jim,We did it.
Andy,"Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that."
Pam,You did it.
Dwight,"""Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!"" That means you can't make me do squat."
Andy,My name is Andy!
Meredith,You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Group,Yeah.
Dwight,You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
Andy,I don't do drugs!
Pam,Week off. That'd be great.
Group,Yeah.
Darryl,"Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so."
Andy,Now check the style!
Clark,I don't want to teach you Power Point.
Group,Yeah.
Darryl,Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
Andy,Of Flatt & Scruggs!
Clark,Just do the tutorial.
Group,Yeah.
Darryl,You're the tutorial.
Pam,Role call.
Clark,"No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial."
Phyllis,Role call.
Darryl,You could be.
Oscar,Role call.
Clark,Mm-mm.
Creed,What?
Darryl,What are you doing?
Jim,Getting my wife a week off from work.
Darryl,You popped one kernel.
Jim,"Awesome, right?"
Clark,So Creed is that dude's step dad?
Darryl,Correct.
Jim,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause."
Dwight,What? Come on.
Creed,I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
Meredith,I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
Dwight,"I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way."
Jim,"""Side effects of EMF include"
Dwight,Had 'em all my life.
Jim,"""..breast pain..."""
Dwight,"No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim."
Jim,"Oof. ""Infertility."""
Dwight,Yeah right.
Jim,Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Dwight,"Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. What the?"
Jim,What?
Dwight,Some of these kernels have crowned.
Jim,"That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god."
Dwight,Andy!
Jim,"I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids."
Pam,"Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?"
Jim,You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
Pam,A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Jim,"Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied."
Pam,"Yeah, OK then."
Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement."
Dwight,"So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week."
Meredith,Nice job.
Dwight,"In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour."
Jim,What?
Pam,What's this?
Andy,Whoa!
Jim,What?
Dwight,Bring it in!
Dwight,"Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done."
Stanley,There are a hundred packs..
Oscar,"No six after the eight, no...."
Stanley,Shh!
Oscar,Shh!
Stanley,Ninety nine cases..yeah.
Oscar,Six.
Angela,Ooh!
Pete,Oh sorry! Sorry.
Angela,Oh my god!
Erin,Sorry.
Meredith,Lose weight.
Erin,I'm trying. Sorry.
Erin,"Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard."
Nellie,"Oh of course, you were adopted."
Erin,"I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? Oh well."
Nellie,"Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?"
Erin,Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
Nellie,Oh thank you so much!
Erin,"Just don't tell Andy, because.."
Nellie,He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness.
Clark,Stretch. Alright.
Stanley,How many times do you need to take a stroll?
Clark,"I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue."
Stanley,"Boy, I will hammer spank your rear."
Jim,"Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face."
Clark,It's a medical thing.
Jim,Just...you good?
Clark,I'm good. I..
Jim,I'm so sorry for all of this.
Pam,"It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest."
Angela,"I, I need to get to the paper please."
Pam,Oh my god! Ah!
Jim,I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
Pam,"You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine."
Jim,"Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. Really? Smirking?"
Dwight,"What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage."
Jim,"Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?"
Dwight,It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Jim,Andy!
Andy,Yo. Dudeces.
Jim,You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Phyllis,"Oh, I know I'd be more productive."
Kevin,As would I.
Stanley,No question.
Dwight,No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Jim,What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
"Phyllis, Kevin & Stanley",Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies!
Andy,"Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving."
Erin,Yes!
Jim,Next stop
Pam,Oh! Yes!
Jim,"So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?"
Dwight,Get your foot behind the yellow line.
Jim,You got it.
Erin,Yeah Jim!
Darryl,Stop.
Clark,Come back.
Darryl,Too late.
Clark,Mmm.
Group,"Shabooyah, role call. Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call."
Pam,My name is Pam.
Group,Yeah!
Pam,I like to paint.
Group,Yeah!
Pam,You think you're better?
Group,Yeah!
Pam,Oh no you ain't!
Group,"Role Call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call!"
Kevin,My name is Kevin.
Group,Yeah!
Kevin,That is my name.
Group,Yeah!
Kevin,They call me Kevin.
Group,Yeah!
Kevin,Cause that's my name.
Group,"Role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call!"
Creed,Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Andy,"Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! Ah OK, now a serious one."
Pam,"Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?"
Jim,"If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah."
Pam,"No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him."
Jim,He's just mad that we're all having fun.
Pam,Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Jim,He's fine. He's indestructible.
Erin,"Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages."
Nellie,"Well, I have considered kidnapping one."
Erin,Never say that.
Erin,I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Nellie,I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Stanley,Next stop pies!
Group,Next stop pies!
Kevin,Next stop pies!
Jim,Let's go driver! Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Kevin,At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Angela,"So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?"
Kevin,Wh...
Oscar,"Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?"
Kevin,314 pies.
Oscar,What if it were salads?
Kevin,"Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work."
Dwight,"I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas."
Jim,"OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop."
Dwight,"That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up."
Jim,"Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!"
Pam,"Hey honey, I don't think we should push him."
Jim,"Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!"
Group,No!
Dwight,"Stop ordering me around, Jim!"
Jim,What do we want?!
Group,Pies!
Jim,When do we want it?!
Group,Pies!
Dwight,"OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie."
Jim,That's impossible. Dwight!
Meredith,Oh my!
Jim,What are you doing?
Meredith,"Dwight, what the hell?"
Oscar,Dwight!
Clark,What?
Kevin,Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Phyllis,Just drive away. Just..
Pam,Phyllis! That's not safe.
Kevin,"Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it."
Pam,Go up and check on him. He's upset.
Jim,You know he's doing all this on purpose.
Pam,Please? Just make sure he's OK?
Stanley,Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
Andy,Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!
Dwight,This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Broccoli Rob,"Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc's of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number."
Erin,
Andy,"You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life, okay? That's group policy and you know it."
Dwight,It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made.
Broccoli Rob,"Look, it's not my fault that I still live near campus, and it's my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week."
Dwight,"My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ..."
Andy,Just don't do the song anymore.
Jim,It won't budge.
Broccoli Rob,"I tell you what, we'll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I'll do the same, and I'm so confident that I'll win, I won't even warm up."
Dwight,I can't get it out. Try again!
Andy,"Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes."
Dwight,"I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin..."
Broccoli Rob,"My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don't you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?"
Dwight,"Jim, no. No. No! No!"
Andy,"I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!"
Dwight,But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
Broccoli Rob,"He said, and I quote, â€˜Hey Rob, nice pipes'. That happened!"
Dwight,At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Andy,"OK, fine, yeah. that's one guy's opinion!"
Erin,Hey guys.
Broccoli Rob,That's real. 'That'll never change!
Pam,Hey.
Erin,Okay!
Erin,"Pam, what are you?"
Andy,Doesn't mean you're the best singer ever. Dick.
Pam,I am Dr. Cinderella.
Jim,I thought that concert was pretty great.
Jim,Cece's really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Kevin,Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Pam,I'm an oncologist and you are a dog.
Angela,They lost me when they sang â€˜Monster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
Erin,"No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen."
Jim,"Angela, it's Halloween. You have to sing â€˜Monster Mash'."
Jim,It's Okay.
Pam,Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
Erin,"Uh, Jim, you're not dressed up at all."
Jim,Uh...
Jim,Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. Can I have your sunglasses?
Pam,"No I'm just, I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?"
Erin,"Jim, come on. I thought we were past this."
Jim,"Okay. We'll, just forget it."
Pam,So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
Pam,"No! No, I'm interested. I mean I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it."
Jim,"There's a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume."
Jim,"Because it is Halloween. So if you're going to sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in."
Pam,Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Pam,"Yeah, yeah, no, no. It's a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing â€˜Monster Mash.'"
Jim,"Gettin' a lot of mileage out of this, aren't ya?"
Kevin,"It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates â€˜Monster Mash.' I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!"
Pam,"Yeah, well, get used to it, bud."
Andy,This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
Andy,"A jitterbug. You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?"
Erin,Yeah.
Angela,The senator will be joining us later.
Andy,"I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?"
Andy,Not a question.
Erin,"Oh well, Andy, we're not moving to Cornell."
Angela,"No, it wasn't."
Andy,Duh. I know. That would be insane.
Andy,"Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere."
Erin,Yeah.
HCT,
Andy,It could totally work though. I don't know why we wouldn't. Oh my god are we doing this?
Andy,"Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!"
Erin,"Oy. Andy, what's going on?"
HCT,
Andy,"If I am not Boner Champ, I don't know who I am."
Andy,Aaah! So good!
Erin,"Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--"
Dwight,What lab did these little clones escape from?
Andy,Make a donation.
Andy,My Cornell a capella group.
Erin,"Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor."
Pam,You were in an a capella group?
Andy,Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
Darryl,You went to Cornell?
Erin,Oh.
Andy,Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
Dwight,I want some of those pills.
Stanley,Ugh. I don't want to sit through a whole concert of that.
Nellie,"Oh, well good for you. I mean, you'll need a prescription."
Clark,I do. I love the boss's interests.
Dwight,"Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose."
Andy,Atta boy Clark!
Nellie,"Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and that I hope he feels better."
Meredith,Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
Dwight,Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
Andy,No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
Nellie,The real Mose.
Andy,"You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared."
Dwight,He says Thank you.
Jim,Are you sure you're okay with me putting in this much money.
Andy,"Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. What?"
Pam,"Yeah. I mean, listen if we're gonna do this thing, we should do it right."
Jim,You're the best.
Erin,What's wrong?
Pam,I kind of am. It's crazy.
Andy,My parents are broke.
Jim,Okay. I'll see you in a little bit.
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,Jim. Look I'm eating you.
Jim,Shut up.
Dwight,"Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims."
Erin,
Dwight,Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
Erin,Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight,"Oh no, I'm spilling Jim all over the carpet."
Erin,Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
Dwight,Hello little pill. What do you do?
Dwight,"Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation"
Pam,Okay I give up. What are you?
Nellie,I'm sexy Toby.
Pam,Gross. I love it.
Dwight,Dumatril!
Nellie,Something wrong Dwight?
Dwight,Dumatril.
Nellie,Yes?
Dwight,This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. It's for a disorder of the mind.
Nellie,The mind is part of the body.
Dwight,"Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... They are now off their meds."
Nellie,"Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so-"
Dwight,"Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me."
Nellie,Hm?
Nellie,"It's my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I'm not ashamed of that, But I'm not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong."
Nellie,"Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended."
Dwight,I'll get my apprehension kit.
Andy,Ruh duh duh da dudes! What's up?
HCT,
Andy,"I know that it's pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that's when I became somebody. When I got the nickname ""Boner Champ,"" that is when I became me."
Andy,"You didn't come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now's your chance! I'm here. You got Qs"
HCT Member #1,Did you say you've got AIDS?
Andy,"No, I don't have AIDS. That's not what I said. Next question."
Andy,You don't have any-- Any questions about the old days? You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
HCT Member #2,I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.
Andy,"I'm sorry, what?"
HCT Member #2,I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.
Andy,Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
Pete,I didn't realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
Creed,Me neither.
Creed,"It's Halloween. That is really, really good timing."
Andy,"I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you're Boner Champ."
Broccoli Rob,I'm so sorry! I don't know how that could have happened.
Andy,Did you maybe tell them that or...?
Broccoli Rob,"I just-- I just started yappin' about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky."
Andy,"Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it's really stupid, but it's also really, really, really important."
Broccoli Rob,"Will do. I love you, Andy."
Andy,Love you too.
Businessman #1,So the workspace looks awesome.
Jim,Wow.
Businessman #2,And the graphic designer is going to be sending in some of the logo treatments. I can't wait to see them.
Businessman #3,You guys rock.
Businessman #1,I killed it.
Businessman #2,"I've also been running the numbers and between our backers and our own investments, we're looking great for a full year on this."
Jim,"Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?"
Businessman #3,"Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you're all set."
Jim,"Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we'd really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor."
Businessman #2,"Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about?"
Jim,We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just - - all in.
Businessman #3,Welcome aboard!
Jim,All right. Awesome. Cool.
Dwight,Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
Nellie,"You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning."
Dwight,"That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?"
Darryl,"I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks."
Dwight,So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Darryl,Get under your chin first. Yeah.
Dwight,Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Darryl,"Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah."
Dwight,Is that how they like to get in?
Darryl,"Yeah, that's crazy."
Dwight,I don't know. I just don't know.
Andy,Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
HCT,Hey.
Andy,Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
HCT Member #3,"Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ."
Andy,Did he tell you how I got the name?
HCT Member #3,No.
Andy,"Spring sing â€˜95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had s*x with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way."
Angela,"And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?"
Oscar,"Senator Lipton, nice to see you."
Senator Lipton,Nice to see you Oscar.
Angela,"Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!"
Senator Lipton,"So Oscar, you're a dinosaur."
Oscar,Actually I'm the electoral college.
Senator Lipton,Ouch! Right on target.
Angela,"You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!"
Senator Lipton,"God, it's just so good to see you."
Oscar,"I, uh, huh, just"
Senator Lipton,"All having this wonderful Halloween gathering. Excuse me, is that punch?"
Andy,"They didn't know about the snowman story, and when I told â€˜em, they were not impressed."
Erin,What is with these turkeys?
Andy,Right?
Erin,Hey! You better do â€˜Faith.' You get me?
HCT Member #3,We don't know it.
Erin,"So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you're like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin' song."
HCT Member #3,"Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but--"
Erin,"Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. This isn't stupid."
Pete,What?
Toby,Hey.
Dwight,Hey.
Nellie,Hey Toby.
Toby,Are... are you me?
Nellie,Yes.
Toby,"Oh my goodness, look. Look at this."
Nellie,Yeah. I...
Toby,
Nellie,"Yes. I thought I'd you know, be you."
Toby,Look at.. Look at me.
Nellie,It's funny right?
Dwight,"All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill."
Nellie,"Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety."
Dwight,You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I've got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne'er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
Meredith,Cool. Free upper.
Dwight,"Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!"
Meredith,Don't dog catch me!
Dwight,"Gotcha! Yeah! Let's see ya get out of this web, huh?"
Meredith,Let me out!
Nellie,The pill is mine.
Dwight,What?
Nellie,Get her out.
Dwight,Oh.
Meredith,Stop baggin' my head!
Nellie,"Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It's for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too."
Pam,"Hey, how'd it go?"
Jim,"Oh man, it was great. They were great."
Pam,Did you end up investing?
Jim,"I did, yeah."
Pam,How much?
Jim,"Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten..."
Pam,About ten?
Jim,Ten. It was the full ten.
Pam,Wow.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,Wow.
Jim,"Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to..."
Pam,No yeah. Yeah.
Jim,Yeah.
Pam,So did everybody ...
Jim,What is it?
Pam,Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
Jim,"Um, oh man, I don't actually know."
Pam,What?
Jim,"They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, We're good with investing and then I...and I..."
Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!"
HCT,
Pam,They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
Jim,"No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam."
Pam,So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
Jim,You weren't there.
HCT,
Jim,It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
HCT,
Pam,Talk about it now.
Jim,Pam.
Pam,"Jim, that was most of our savings."
HCT,
Clark,Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where's the band? â€˜Cause there's just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
Creed,Yeah. That's what she said.
Clark,"What, am I overdoing it? No. No."
HCT,
Pam,We said some. We said â€˜some.'
Jim,We'll talk about it later.
HCT,
Pam,We said part not all.
HCT,
Clark,Yes! All right!
Andy,Oh Man!
Clark,That's how you do that! Whoo!
HCT,Thank you.
Stanley,Show some pride. This is crap.
Dwight,"I agree. Yes, crap. Continue."
HCT Member #3,"Now folks, by special request, we're going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room."
Darryl,Who?
HCT Member #3,It's Mr. Andy Bernard!
All,
HCT,
Andy,No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
HCT Member #3,"He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here's an old Treble classic."
HCT,
Broccoli Rob,
Andy,Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
HCT Member #3,She said you wanted to hear â€˜Faith'. That's Broccoli Rob's signature song.
Andy,That's my signature song.
HCT Member #3,I really didn't know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it.
Andy,"Russell, I'm dressed like George Michael."
HCT Member #3,I thought you were Adam Lambert.
Andy,Wha...?
Erin,"The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic. But when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love."
Erin,Are you okay?
Broccoli Rob,He's still mad.
Andy,"Shut up, Broccoli."
Oscar,Can you guys come with me for a minute?
Kevin,"Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information."
Oscar,"I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion....Why?"
Oscar,"Well, I am sorry Kevin."
Andy,"Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?"
Angela,Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
White,Or we can hope for a holiday rally?
Kevin,You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.
Andy,"White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster."
Angela,Honey! What are you doing here?
Pam,Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
Senator Liptop,"I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you're looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise?"
Jim,"And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar."
Oscar,No.
Pam,The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
Angela,Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
Jim,Competent.
Senator Liptop,"What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly."
Pam,Right?
Oscar,You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
Andy,"Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, him."
Kevin,"Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support."
Oscar,"Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?"
Senator Liptop,"Well, thanks everybody."
Kevin,"That's beautiful. No, I totally get that."
Kevin,It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
Oscar,"Can you do this, Kevin?"
Oscar,U..s..a. U-
Kevin,"I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that."
Oscar,"I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control."
Oscar,"I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-"
Kevin,I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. Oscar is having s*x with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. Her life is a complete sham!
Pam,"Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?"
Andy,"Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever!"
Creed,"Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show."
Erin,"Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend."
Pam,"Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?"
Andy,Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
Dwight,I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
Erin,"Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic."
Dwight,"The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? ""Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt."" It's that easy."
Andy,I'll see you in three weeks!
Meredith,"Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze."
Erin,OK!
Andy,Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
Walt Jr.,Hey bro! It was here all along.
Meredith,Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
Andy,No way!
Andy,"No, it's in New Mexico."
Walt Jr.,Way!
Meredith,Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
Andy,Erin I gotta go! Them's my chords!
Andy,We're done Meredith.
Pete,Hey. She's back.
Dwight,"blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle..."
Erin,Thanks for covering the phones.
Jim,Dwight!
Pete,"Yeah, no problem. How was it?"
Dwight,"...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason."
Erin,Fine.
Jim,"No, you chose yourself."
Pete,"Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper."
Dwight,Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
Erin,Does he have a flipper?
Andy,"Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom."
Pete,"Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk."
Darryl,Sounds great.
Erin,He sounds like an idiot.
Oscar,Perfect.
Pete,"Yeah, he is."
Andy,"Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas."
Erin,Ok.
Kevin,What happened?
Pete,Ok.
Angela,Jammed. This day couldn't get worse.
Erin,Thanks.
Kevin,"Yeah, I think this day could get worse."
Pete,Yeah.
Angela,What does that mean?
Oscar,Kevin!
Kevin,I don't know what you're talking about.
Erin,She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
Andy,"Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?"
Darryl,"If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months."
Andy,"Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born."
Erin,Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
Darryl,I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
Erin,See? I bet you wouldn't sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
Darryl,I would if I owned it and I went broke.
Andy,"Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat."
Andy,"Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it? Excuse me."
Pam,"Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so..."
Nellie,Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Pam,He's gonna be disappointed.
Jim,Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
Pete,Fax?
Erin,"Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. He's seriously juvenile."
Pete,"Cool. He's like 40 though, right?"
Erin,"Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops."
Pete,Awesome. Have fun.
Dwight,Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- This is Dwight Shrute.
Pam,Please hold for Ms. Black.
Nellie,And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
Dwight,"Iris, thank you so much for having me."
Erin,Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.
Andy,"Uh, did you need something?"
Erin,"Oh, I just need your signature on this."
Andy,Ok. thanks.
Angela,"Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?"
Kevin,I... did not.
Angela,I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
Kevin,"Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! I have to go to the bathroom!"
Angela,That doesn't surprise me.
Oscar,"That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom."
Jim,See these forms...
Kevin,I have to go to the bathroom!
Kevin,I have to go to the bathroom!
Kevin,
Erin,"Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?"
Andy,"Look, it's not that I don't want-"
Erin,"Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect."
Andy,"All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ""You can't be a skipper until you're a man."" You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance."
Erin,"Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?"
Andy,Tonight.
Erin,Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
Andy,"Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now."
Erin,"Ok, well then let's leave like right now."
Andy,"Yeah, ok."
Erin,Yeah! OK! Let's go.
Andy,Seriously?
Erin,"Of course, seriously. Get your coat on."
Andy,Alright.
Erin,Alright.
Andy,Let's do it.
Erin,Let's do it!
Dwight,"Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on."
Nellie,So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
Dwight,"Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris."
Nellie,"Uh, excuse me. I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?"
Dwight,Yes..?
Nellie,I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
Dwight,"Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather-"
Nellie,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine."
Dwight,That's impossible.
Nellie,Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
Angela,The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
Oscar,That's a tough one.
Angela,That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
Kevin,"Please, stop."
Angela,What?
Kevin,"Please, stop."
Angela,"Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in."
Kevin,"I can't, it's too much!"
Oscar,I'm in big trouble.
Kevin,"Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble."
Dwight,"OK, how is my voice now?"
Nellie,"I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?"
Dwight,This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
Oscar,It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
Toby,Yeah.
Oscar,So...
Toby,Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
Oscar,"Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do."
Dwight,"This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! I dare you to produce one credible source about this."
Nellie,"Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick"
Pam,"Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure."
Nellie,Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
Pam,No the paper's not toxic.
Dwight,Thank you Sandra!
Pam,Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Dwight,Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!
Jim,What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Dwight,Get out of here moron!
Nellie,"Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?"
Dwight,uhhhh....no one.
Nellie,Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
Dwight,"No, everything's fine."
Nellie,Are you insulting my guests?
Dwight,
Kevin,"Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?"
Oscar,"I hope that's it, Kevin."
Kevin,"Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that."
Toby,"Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-"
Kevin,Hi.
Oscar,"Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just.."
Kevin,"Oscar, we're in the middle of talking."
Oscar,"Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me."
Kevin,Oh that is nice. Classy move.
Dwight,That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
Kevin,What are you doing?
Oscar,Those figures I gave you? They're false.
Toby,How?
Oscar,"I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively."
Toby,So you set him up.
Oscar,"Yes, he's innocent."
Toby,I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
Oscar,What are you talking about? I just did this now.
Toby,"A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler.."
Oscar,Sure.
Toby,I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
Oscar,That's gotta be tough.
Toby,Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
Nellie,"The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?"
Dwight,"My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!"
Erin,That's yours?
Andy,That's the family boat!
Erin,"Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!"
Andy,Right?
Erin,I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
Boat Guy,Move.
Andy,Sorry?
Boat Guy,Trying to rig a boat here. I don't know how to do that when you're standing in the way.
Andy,"Sure, I um..I didn't know."
Boat Guy,"I'm not a ghost, so I can't walk through people."
Andy,Ok.
Erin,"Gee, he was salty."
Andy,"Geez, a little bit. How you doing old buddy? Missed you."
Erin,What does that one do?
Andy,It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
Erin,I wish I had seen you do it.
Andy,Really?
Erin,Yeah.
Andy,Up she goes!
Boat Guy,Don't do that. Don't do that.
Andy,"Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me."
Boat Guy,Nope. Can't do that.
Andy,"You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor."
Boat Guy,We've already started boarding. And no one is insured to rig her up right now except us.
Andy,"You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- wow."
Boat Guy,I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you're not supposed to touch.
Andy,"Ok, fine."
Boat Guy,OK.
Andy,"Yeah, fine."
Boat Guy,Good stuff.
Andy,Good stuff. Nice stuff. Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
Erin,"Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat."
Andy,I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
Erin,"Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man."
Andy,Fine. But I could have.
Erin,"As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain."
Andy,I am the captain.
Erin,Yeah.
Andy,Right?
Erin,Yeah.
Andy,"I'm the captain. Hey, charm school."
Boat Guy,What?
Andy,I'm taking it over from here.
Erin,Nice!
Boat Guy,"I hate to uh, ruin this moment...or breakdown, but you already signed the papers. So, if you want your boat back, you can pick it up there in the Bahamas in 10 days."
Andy,"Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there."
Boat Guy,"OK, no. I already said, you're not getting back your deposit."
Andy,"Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?"
Nellie,"For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson."
Jim,Good afternoon!
Dwight,Please sir! Spare him. Please.
Jim,"Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!"
Dwight,"Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in."
Nellie,"Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace."
Erin,Do you even know what you're doing?
Andy,"Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello. Walt?"
Walt Jr.,"Oh god, thank goodness you're here. I was having a little trouble with this door. Yesterday. I um, I think it was yesterday."
Andy,I thought you were in rehab.
Walt Jr.,"Yeah, uh, I just, I figured I'd get that first relapse out of the way. God, what's happened to our family? Everything is so messed up! How did you even know I was in here?"
Andy,"I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda."
Erin,"Bahamas, Andy."
Andy,"Same thing. Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on."
David Wallace,Hello?
Dwight,"David, is that you?"
David Wallace,Dwight?
Dwight,"Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?"
David Wallace,Yeah? Are you ok?
Dwight,"Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David."
David Wallace,"Well, thanks Dwight."
Dwight,"You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?"
David Wallace,Dwight?
Dwight,Walk out of the house...
David Wallace,What?
Dwight,"...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison."
David Wallace,"Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go."
Dwight,"Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?"
All,Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!
Dwight,Shrute! Shrute!
Dwight,"Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected."
Andy,"Ah, what else? I've seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times. Breaks my heart every time, you know?"
Jan,"Well, it's not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, ""Cece"" is two letters and ""Astrid"" is... I mean, there's even some adults who -- who -- who can't spell it."
Everyone,Whoa!
Pam,Of course.
Pam,Andy.
Jan,"Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam."
Andy,That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
Pam,"Um... ""A""... ""X""? I don't -- you got me."
Phyllis,Don't you have any sunblock?
Jan,Don't patronize me.
Andy,"No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull."
Pam,I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better.
Erin,"Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family's boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry."
Angela,"Okay, we should go now. Let's go."
Andy,"Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now."
Oscar,Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch.
Darryl,"Andy, it's Darryl. Take your drawers off your head."
Angela,Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire --
Andy,"What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!"
Oscar,Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it.
Erin,"Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?"
Angela,What?
Andy,"Yeah, it was. That's okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow!"
Oscar,"This could be the affair that you're scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. But uh, he's probably not gay. He's straight. He's straight, so..."
Everyone,Oh!
Pam,Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
Andy,"Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?"
Jan,No.
Darryl,He's been sailing for two days.
Dwight,Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Andy,I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
Pam,"Oh, my God."
Erin,Yeah.
Clark,Where's the Quizno's?
Andy,No. No! Nooo!
Dwight,"You're the Quizno's. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?"
Erin,Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
Jan,I -- I --
Dwight,"Dwight Schrute. Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?"
Dwight,Hmm?
David,"Well, I have some very exciting news."
Jan,"I don't recall. And yes, Molly is crap."
Dwight,And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant.
Pam,"Okay, you do not have to do this."
Jim,"Hi, David."
Clark,Do what? Get into sales? That's what I want.
David,"Jim, good! You should hear this too."
Dwight,He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
Dwight,"No, he shouldn't."
Jan,"Will you uh, you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business."
Jim,"Go ahead David, I'm listening."
Dwight,Very good.
Dwight,"Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don't know where I'd put you."
Jan,Do you have a valid passport?
David,"Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They've apparently just dropped the supplier they've been with for the last ten years. ."
Jim,Jim Halpert.
Dwight,The White Pages.
Colin,"Hey, it's Colin."
Dwight,The White Pages
Jim,Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
David,"Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you."
Colin,I know. Don't worry about it.
Dwight,I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley?
Jim,
Erin,He's in the bathroom.
Colin,It's just... it's not totally working.
Dwight,Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Jim,"Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out."
Erin,Of course.
Colin,"Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this."
Dwight,"Yeah! Okay. Hey David, I'm back."
Jim,"Uh, what does -- what does that mean?"
Erin,Eat it Stanley!
Angela,"Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?"
Dwight,"So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?"
Oscar,"I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go."
David,"No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It's someone new but she didn't catch her name."
Angela,"Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?"
Dwight,Her name?
Oscar,He's making a phone call.
Phyllis,"No, hey, Dwight shouldn't..."
Angela,Oh. Oh.
Dwight,Shhh! Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
Oscar,
David,Good luck!
Pam,"Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit."
Dwight,Good luck to you.
Molly,Thanks. Okay.
Phyllis,"Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them."
Dwight,"Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings."
Dwight,That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Pam,"Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number."
Phyllis,Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her â€˜gy-na' for your entire meeting.
Dwight,"Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL."
Nellie,Ew. That's not good.
Pam,That's a license number?
Phyllis,"Yeah, she said she corrected him five times."
Dwight,"That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know."
Dwight,â€˜Gy-na' said that?
Pam,Oh. Why me?
Phyllis,"Guys, we can't let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back."
Dwight,"Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It's like air to you people. Ugh, God."
Meredith,Hey remember that week in the 90's when we got bagels?
Creed,I miss Clinton.
Pam,Can you go instead?
Jim,I can't. I have the thing.
Jim,"I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I've ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong."
Pete,"Okay, call down. It's just me, not Tom Selleck."
Guys in breakroom,
Kevin,Nice!
Pete,Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It's a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
Clark,"So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time."
Darryl,"Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?"
Toby,I have very fertile hair glands.
Toby,I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
Clark,God!
Toby,"We even go to lunch, pick up babes."
Toby,Smile if you love men's prostates.
Angela,Hi.
Oscar,Hi.
Angela,Spring cleaning?
Oscar,More like fall cleaning.
Angela,I think the senator is having an affair.
Oscar,This doesn't... I'm sorry. Wha... what?
Angela,I think the senator is having an affair.
Oscar,I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed.
Angela,"When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile."
Oscar,"Oh, I'm sure ...that's nothing."
Angela,And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it's Hot Yoga with Blake.
Oscar,"Angela, Blake's also a guy's name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?"
Angela,I don't know.
Oscar,I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
Angela,Right.
Oscar,From you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already?
Angela,Right?
Oscar,"And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out."
Angela,What?
Oscar,"Angela, I'll go with you."
Phyllis,"So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client."
Dwight,"Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog."
Pam,You've got this Schrute.
Phyllis,"Okay, you just walked into her office and begin."
Dwight,Hello.
Erin,Hello.
Dwight,May I please speak to your boss?
Phyllis,"No, she is the boss."
Erin,"I am? Hmm.. Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?"
Dwight,"Okay, this isn't working for me, â€˜cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss."
Erin,He's absolutely right. I'm really struggling.
Pam,"Oh, I'll be the buyer."
Dwight,
Pam,"Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat."
Dwight,I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Phyllis,"No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs."
Dwight,"I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over."
Pam,"Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?"
Dwight,I thought it went great.
Nellie,"I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?"
Business partner,Okay lets get started.
Jim,"Yeah, I'm here. Are we all on?"
Business partner,"Uh,, well you're the only one â€˜on' - we're all here."
Jim,"Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months..."
Kevin,"That's the winter season., three months."
Jim,"I uh, I have some ideas, actually..."
Business partner,Are you at your office right now?
Jim,"Uh yeah. Trust me, I'd rather be with you guys."
Business partner,"Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert."
Jim,"Oh, Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh..."
Business partner,"Whoa. I think there's been a bit of a mistake. We're trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman."
Jim,"Um, you know what? I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell."
Business partner,"Uh, yeah..."
Jim,I'm gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Business partner,"Okay, yeah."
Jim,"Okay, I'll call you right back."
Kevin,What's happening in three months?
Pam,"Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?"
Dwight,Yes.
Pam,"Okay, well you have to show us."
Dwight,"That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all."
Pam,Huh. Uh huh.
Dwight,What are you doing?
Pam,A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Dwight,Kind of.
Pam,"Nellie, why don't you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you're listening."
Nellie,"Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I've commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way."
Erin,"It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person."
Dwight,I am a person.
Erin,Yes.
Nellie,And then we thought we'd ... I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
Dwight,That's a bit extreme.
Nellie,"No, I'm sorry but that is true."
Meredith,He's screwed. They're meeting in less than an hour.
Phyllis,"Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn."
Dwight,"Okay, I'm a woman. I'm a woman. Good?"
Phyllis,"Ms. Thomas, so good to see you."
Dwight,Hello.
Phyllis,"Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models."
Dwight,Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my v*g1n*.
Meredith,Booo! Weird.
Nellie,No.
Phyllis,"Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It's hopeless."
Pam,"Ten years ago, I didn't care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I'm like, that poor gimp is somebody's child."
Pam,"You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women."
Dwight,"Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!"
Pam,"Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?"
Dwight,I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Pam,"Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber."
Dwight,"Okay, I can do that."
Pam,Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
Dwight,He used to fight dogs.
Pam,"Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?"
Dwight,"Little of this, little of that."
Angela,Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
Oscar,Angela! Angela. There.
Angela,Where?
Oscar,"On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her."
Angela,"Oh my God! She's so stunningly tiny! She's like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they're doing."
Oscar,She's repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
Angela,"I've heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go."
Oscar,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Angela,Ow.
Oscar,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look."
Pete,
Toby,"This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun."
Jim,"What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --"
Business partner,"It was in what? Jim, we're having a lot of trouble hearing you."
Jim,The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
Hank,Hey! Are those skateboarders back?
Business partner,"Jim? Jim, are you there?"
Hank,Where are they?
Jim,"It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ..."
Meredith,Who was messing with my van?
Jim,Nobody!
Business partner,"Jordan wore them for nobody? We're not following you, Halpert."
Jim,"No, no, no."
Hank,This ends now!
Secretary,"Have a seat. Um, she will be right in."
Pam,"Oh, great. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don't have it."
Secretary,Uh... um she'll be right in.
Pam,"Okay, great."
Dwight,"Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it."
Pam,Oh my God. It's Jan.
Dwight,"Oh, dear God in heaven."
Pam,"Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met."
Jan,You son of a bitch. You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
Pam,"Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?"
Pam,"Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you."
Jan,Where's Wallace?
Pam,What?
Jan,"I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?"
Dwight,Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.
Pam,"Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead."
Jan,Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
Molly,"Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing â€˜cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them..."
Jan,Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
Molly,I'm so sorry Jan.
Jan,"I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing?"
Dwight,Listening.
Jan,Stop.
Dwight,Sorry.
Jan,Stop that.
Dwight,Okay.
Pam,So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give?
Jan,"No, I do."
Pam,But not to us.
Jan,"Insightful, Pam."
Pam,"You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us."
Dwight,"Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back."
Pam,What?
Jan,Pam?
Pam,Yeah.
Jan,"I'm a very busy woman, so..."
Pam,"Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?"
Jan,Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
Pete,"Erin, did this call..."
Erin,Uh!
Pete,What?
Erin,"Sorry, I uh, just saw your face."
Pete,"Oh, I'm sorry. It's for the thing."
Erin,I know. That's great. It just - it makes it look like there's an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
Pete,Wow.
Erin,"A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn't bad."
Pete,Uh-huh.
Erin,"But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It's such a great cause."
Pete,Yeah.
Erin,
Jan,"Mommy, you're a princess. Mommy, you're a superstar. Mommy you're the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?"
Pam,Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
Jan,Aw.
Pam,And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Jan,"Well, that -- that was -- that was me too."
Pam,"Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards â€˜E's."
Jan,Cece can't spell her name.
Pam,"Oh, actually she can."
Oscar,"Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual."
Nellie,Were they angry?
Oscar,Good morning.
Pam,I-- I thought they were confused at least...
Angela,Oscar... can I ask you a question?
Nellie,Okay.
Oscar,"Of course, ask me a que--  questions."
Angela,Is it cool in here to you?
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!"
Oscar,"Yes, a little bit. Yes."
Everyone,
Angela,I think the thermostat is acting up again.
Kevin,Nice. Nice.
Oscar,"It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs."
Creed,You did good. You did good.
Angela,Thank you.
Pete,"See ya later, Heymont."
Oscar,"No, thank you, Angela."
Dwight,No.
Oscar,"She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love."
Trevor,"If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend."
Dwight,"Well, well, well, it's finally happened. Pam has ceased caring."
Oscar,"What the hell, Dwight?"
Pam,These are my painting clothes.I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.
Dwight,"See ya later, Trevor."
Meredith,"Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one."
Oscar,you are incorrigible!
Jim,"You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?"
Dwight,I just saved your life. You're welcome!
Pam,Are you avoiding your phone call?
Oscar,You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
Jim,"What? Yeah, right. As if."
Angela,You deserved every bit of it!  You made my husband gay.
Jim,"Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there."
Oscar,"What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!"
Pam,"Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead."
Angela,No. No.
Jim,I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
Oscar,"Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me."
Pam,Tell them your opening line.
Angela,Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
Jim,"Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?"
Oscar,"Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe."
Pam,I think it's good. He likes fishing.
Angela,God!
Jim,This is gonna be awful.
Oscar,Aah!
Pete,"One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ""chillax,"" and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house.  Fight the power."
Angela,You were supposed to be my friend.
Angela,"Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you."
Oscar,I'm so sorry. Angela--
Angela,Ugh!
Dwight,Oscar.
Dwight,"Come on in, the water's fine."
Pete,Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
Angela,"Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on."
Everyone,
Dwight,I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes.
Pete,For insulting a client's recently deceased mother.
Angela,Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
Nellie,Yes!
Dwight,"Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?"
Pam,I did not know that.
Angela,My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
Pete,"Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life."
Dwight,"All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?"
Pam,I'm so sorry.
Angela,Something like that.
Meredith,Wow.
Dwight,"Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force."
Pete,yeah. That's-- that is terrible.
Angela,Can you arrange a meeting?
Everyone,
Dwight,I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.
Kevin,You did it.
Angela,Okay.
Erin,Yeah!
Dwight,Text went through.
Angela,I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
Angela,Okay.
Dwight,You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
Dwight,All we can do is sit and wait.
Angela,"Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes!"
Angela,Okay.
Dwight,"I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey."
Dwight,"Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem."
Angela,I don't like your friend Trevor.
Jim,"I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly."
Dwight,I don't like him either.  And yet I really like him.
David,"Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis -- the more I think about it --"
Jim,"Well, we're here. Perfect."
Jim,"Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone."
Phyllis,"We're gonna cover for you, ya know."
David,They did?
Stanley,
Jim,Yep.
Jim,"Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--"
David,"Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work."
Stanley,"I did enjoy grinding your beans, son."
Jim,"Oh, great."
Phyllis,"Yeah, we really did peel your grapes."
Stanley,Why should we help you?
Jim,"This is hilarious, but we're gonna stop with all--"
Jim,Because we're friends.
Stanley,Shuckin' your peas.
Stanley,When is my birthday?
Jim,"Shuckin' the peas.  You should go back to the first part, though. You are  gonna  cover for me?"
Jim,Unfair. When's my birthday?
Stanley,Yeah.
Stanley,"I don't know, because we're not friends."
Phyllis,"Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys."
Jim,"How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?"
Jim,"Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you."
Stanley,Now we're talkin'.
Pam,"If you're an artist, you have to be okay with the idea  that you can't please everybody all the time."
Jim,All right.
Hide,You paint very bad--
Phyllis,Yeah.
Pam,"Shut up, Hide!  I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that."
Kevin,Make it go taller.
Dwight,Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Pete,That's the idea.
Toby,That is-- that is a loaded question.
Kevin,"No, not taller this way, taller this way."
Angela,My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
Pete,"Well, I've gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher."
Toby,He said that?
Kevin,"You're not getting this, Peter.  Make it go wider... up!"
Angela,"Well, he didn't fight me hard on it."
Pete,Will do.
Toby,"I-- I don't know if there's truth to-- to, uh, to that."
Darryl,What are y'all doing?
Angela,What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
Kevin,Me and Pete are building a tower.
Toby,Oh... uh...
Darryl,"Cool. It should be taller though, right?"
Angela,Is it called red-vining?
Kevin,"Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer."
Dwight,Is it called red-vining?
Pete,"Kevin, I can hear you."
Toby,I don't...
Kevin,Huh?
Dwight,We heard it was called red-vining.
Angela,Ow! Dwight! Ow!
Angela,People red vine.
Dwight,Get in the van.
Dwight,Where are gay mens' vaginas?
Angela,God!
Toby,They don't have vaginas.
Trevor,Is it safe to talk?
Dwight,What?
Dwight,"Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good."
Toby,No. They're just regular men.
Angela,So what are your credentials?
Dwight,"When two gay men have s*x, how do they know whose pen1s will open up to accept the other person's pen1s?"
Trevor,"I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I'm damn good at it."
Toby,Uh... wow....
Angela,Do you have a gun?
Dwight,Does he own a gun? Show her.
Trevor,You tell me.
Angela,What is this?
Trevor,It's the receipt for my gun.
Angela,You don't carry it with you?
Trevor,Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.
Dwight,Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?
Trevor,Now I keep it in a safe.
Dwight,Mm-hmm. Good safe?
Trevor,"Oh, you tell me."
Dwight,Wow!
Pam,"I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub."
Hide,You paint wall now?
Pam,Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
Hide,You paint now.
Pam,It's probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
Hide,I wait.
Meredith,Sweet.
Erin,Yay!
Darryl,That's what I'm talkin' about.
Pete,"This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote â€˜sausage factory.'"
Meredith,Oh OOOH!
Everyone,
Meredith,Boom!
Darryl,Bang.
Kevin,"Yep, yep, yep."
Pete,All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
Creed,Let's find out what I did.
Pete,All right.
Dwight,You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Trevor,And that's all off the books?
Angela,Obviously.
Trevor,Nice. No taxes.
Angela,"Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here."
Trevor,So what's the job?
Angela,Murder.
Trevor,"Okay, that's the big one. That's the big ""M."""
Dwight,You can't have someone murdered.
Angela,What if they deserved it?
Dwight,"What did they do to you, Angela?"
Angela,They're sleeping with my husband.
Dwight,"Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you."
Trevor,This seems a little crazy.
Dwight,Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
Trevor,But I think I'm up for it.
Dwight,No! No!
Angela,Thank you.
Dwight,"Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--"
Trevor,That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It's devastating.
Angela,"No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer."
Trevor,What about a knee-capping?
Dwight,"No! You're not helping, Trevor!"
Angela,"Yes, a knee-capping could work."
Dwight,No. Angela! What are you saying?
Angela,You said you would be there for me.
Dwight,"I'm trying, but what you're asking is--"
Angela,It's the only thing that will make this right.
Dwight,"Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn."
Trevor,"All right, then it's settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4"
Jim,"You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone."
Stanley,We've got all afternoon to talk about that.
Waiter,"Morning, folks."
Stanley,I'll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
Waiter,"Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--"
Stanley,Not enough lobster. Side order.
Phyllis,How much wine do you have?
Oscar,I brought you a cookie.
Angela,"Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel."
Oscar,"I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we're good. Yeah. We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye."
Pete,There we go.
Everyone,
Pete,"Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having s*x."
Nellie,Oooohh... you salty dog.
Darryl,"Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play."
Pete,There you go.
Darryl,"Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing."
Kevin,"Okay, I got this one."
Nellie,"Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful"
Kevin,"No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath."
Everyone,Oh no! Kevin!
Nellie,What did I just say? What did I just say?
Pete,"Hey, hey, hey, it's just a mistake. Just a mistake. That's what this tower's all about --  mistakes. Okay, if you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That's right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let's get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?"
Kevin,Yeah.
Pete,"There we go. All right, let's do it."
Jim,"You know, at the end of the day, it's really only two days. I mean, I'll be back in the office.  If you need me for an emergency, call me.  I'll be there..."
Phyllis,"You know what? I don't know where the years went.  â€˜Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them."
Jim,Tell me about it.
Phyllis,Whose hands are these? Theyre not my hands. I don't know.
Jim,All right. You know what?  Maybe we'll just... We'll go slow.
Phyllis,No. Jim...
Pete,All right. Check it out.
Everyone,
Pete,Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
Kevin,"Nice.  Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling."
Erin,Whoo!
Pete,Can you hand me a card?
Erin,"Um,. it's empty."
Pete,What?
Nellie,"Oh, come on. We could use a blank card."
Everyone,No!!
Meredith,That's cheating.
Pam,I could get us a complaint.
Meredith,You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn't fart on a butterfly.
Pam,"No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try."
Nellie,"Hmm. Yeah.  All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam..."
Everyone,"""Pam!"""
Angela,What? Why did you call me out here?
Dwight,"The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other."
Angela,I don't know what you're talking about.
Dwight,"Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils."
Angela,Fine! It's Oscar. So what?
Dwight,"Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?"
Angela,"Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband."
Dwight,I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Angela,"Well, you might be right. But it's too late now."
Dwight,What do you mean?
Angela,He's here.
Dwight,"No! No, no!"
Dwight,"Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me."
Oscar,What?
Dwight,Come -- come with me.
Oscar,What are you doing?
Dwight,"There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary."
Meredith,Yahtzee.
Trevor,Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez.
Kevin,I am Oscar Martinez.
Angela,"No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside."
Kevin,Wha-- wh--
Angela,"You know, there's doughnuts in the break room."
Kevin,Nice! Yeah.
Jim,"Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over."
Stanley,Don't be pushy Jim. It's tacky.
Jim,"All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that's-- that's decorative."
Phyllis,"No, there's wine in here."
Jim,Still decorative.
Stanley,Is it white wine?
Jim,No.
Phyllis,Can you help me?
Jim,Don't-- don't-- don't pole people with knives.
Phyllis,ha ha!
Jim,Phyllis!  Wow.
Stanley,"Ooh, bring it over."
Phyllis,Got it.
Dwight,"There's no time to explain. Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps."
Oscar,"Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?"
Dwight,"What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?"
Oscar,I don't know what you're talking about.
Dwight,"Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us."
Dwight,"Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us."
Trevor,"Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this."
Dwight,"No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe."
Trevor,"I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!"
Oscar,I got it.
Dwight,Disarm!
Trevor,You don't--
Dwight,Don't move. And disarm now!
Trevor,"Okay, okay, okay, okay."
Dwight,"No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend."
Erin,"Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away from your edge!"
Nellie,"Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you."
Creed,"Remember, you're a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this."
Pam,"Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ""Hey, kool-aid."" Yeah, your mama's fat. This is Pam Halpert."
Pete,Did she buy it?
Pam,"Basically I couldn't tell, but I think..."
Jim,I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
Pam,What's going on?
Pam,I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
Dwight,"Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!"
Jim,"Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?"
Jim,"I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5"
Phyllis,"We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero."
Dwight,"Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever."
Jim,"So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word ""Philadelphia""?"
Angela,Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
Dwight,"Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning ""Love,"" and adelph, meaning ""Adolf."" ""the city that loves Adolf."" Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle."
Nellie,"Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there."
Toby,"Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting."
Erin,"Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!"
Darryl,"Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing."
Angela,No.
Nellie,Is It?
Darryl,Boo!
Erin,"I mean, it says ""X-Mas party,"" but I think we all know what that's code for."
Pam,"For what it's worth, I liked your party better."
Kevin,"So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?"
Dwight,"Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak."
Angela,"Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee."
Pam,I don't think anyone thought that.
Kevin,"Well, you are the one in charge of it."
Dwight,Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Angela,Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
Pam,"Well, that didn't have anything to do with you."
Oscar,"Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot."
Dwight,I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
Oscar,"I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points."
Pam,Zero.
Phyllis,"I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works."
Dwight,Damn It!
Meredith,"We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!"
Darryl,I'm gonna tell Jim to go himself.
Nellie,"Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?"
Erin,Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
Kevin,"Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?"
Pete,"Yeah. Definitely. Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. Hey, hey. Come on, huh?"
Dwight,"What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel."
Erin,I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
Jim,"Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?"
Pete,"Oh, yeah, of course. I know."
Kevin,No.
Erin,But you can leave your arm.
Angela,No!
Jim,"Done, right?"
Angela,No.
Pam,"Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?"
Stanley,No. I want Tropical Christmas.
Dwight,"No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt."
Meredith,Topless Christmas.
Jim,"Yep, I did say that."
Creed,Tapas swiss miss.
Pam,Jim!
Creed,"Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?"
Jim,What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
Dwight,"Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular."
Pam,Oh--Oh my god!
Phyllis,We already said no.
Angela,"No, no, no."
Jim,"What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building."
Nellie,Too weird.
Dwight,Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!
Dwight,"This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style."
Pam,What happened? Did you miss your bus?
Jim,"I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?"
Jim,No. I just missed my wife.
Angela,"Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now."
Dwight,I found it!
Pam,I'm on it.
Jim,And I found out that there's a bus at 5
Jim,Right.
Pete,I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Dwight,Oh! Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
Erin,"Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain."
Pete,Die hard reference.
Darryl,"Back for more, huh?"
Erin,I haven't seen it.
Jim,"Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?"
Pete,You haven't seen die hard?
Darryl,You!
Erin,Mm-Mmm.
Jim,"Oh, hey, man. Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview."
Pete,Why haven't you seen die hard?
Darryl,That's great.
Erin,"I don't know, I just haven't."
Jim,Right?
Kevin,"Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it."
Darryl,"Thanks, man."
Erin,No.
Jim,"Hey, of course."
Kevin,"""now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho."""
Darryl,I shall come by at your convenience.
Pete,"""Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs."""
Jim,"Thank you, sir."
Erin,None of this makes any sense to me!
Darryl,Whoo!
Kevin,"Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, ""Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--"""
Jim,Go get 'em.
Pete,"Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans."
Darryl,Oh! Whoa!
Kevin,"Yes, you are right. Forgive me."
Pete,"Oh, that's okay, bud."
Dwight,Very impish.
Kevin,Nope.
Pete,Common mistake.
Toby,"Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--"
Kevin,"No, it's not."
Nellie,Shh.
Erin,Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
Toby,What? I was just explaining--
Pete,"My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it."
Nellie,Shh.
Erin,"Okay, let's hear it."
Toby,Why wouldn't it--
Pete,Hear what?
Nellie,Shh.
Erin,Die hard. Every line. Go.
Toby,But why?
Pete,"""You don't like flying, do you?"""
Nellie,No...more...talking.
Erin,Don't change the subject.
Toby,Are you gonna kiss me?
Pete,"No, that's the--"
Nellie,Yes.
Erin,Movie is starting.
Jim,We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
Stanley,I love Philly. Dirty town.
Darryl,"Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man."
Jim,Whoo!
Darryl,So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
Jim,"Yeah, I think so."
Darryl,Think that through for a sec.
Darryl,"Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?"
Darryl,What else could you possibly be forgetting?
Jim,Uh--
Darryl,Things? People?
Toby,"You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison for something he may not have done."
Nellie,"I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?"
Toby,The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
Nellie,"Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand."
Toby,I--I could--I could talk about it.
Stanley,See you next Christmas.
Toby,"I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back."
Pam,"We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us."
Phyllis,Let's do it!
Pam,Yes! Phyllis!
Angela,No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
Pam,What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
Angela,Please just take my name off of everything.
Oscar,Just take her name off of everything.
Pam,"The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas."
Dwight,Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Pam,"Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously."
Dwight,Uh-huh.
Pam,And that is...
Dwight,"Uh, Oh."
Pam,That there are no rules.
Dwight,You have never been cooler.
Jim,Best Christmas ever.
Pam,You're welcome.
Jim,Thank you.
Dwight,And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
Meredith,"Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?"
Dwight,"That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy."
Pam,What is it? Don't touch it.
Dwight,Somebody's found the hog maw.
Pam,Oh!
Dwight,"What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it."
Stanley,Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
Dwight,"It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib."
Jim,Can't wait.
Meredith,Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Dwight,"This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces."
Oscar,How would anyone even know--
Dwight,Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
Jim,I don't know. Is it what you expected?
Pam,I feel like--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
Jim,So happy right now.
Dwight,"Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump."
Kevin,I wish my car had a bathroom.
Pete,"""Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--"""
Erin,"Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete."
Pete,That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
Erin,"I don't know. This looks pretty legit. Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land."
Erin,"""What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."""
Pete,Hey. Everything okay?
Erin,So what comes next?
Pete,"Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, ""After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--"""
Erin,We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
Pete,"Or we can just sit and talk, though."
Erin,No. No more talking. It's movie time.
Pete,"I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car."
Erin,"Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan."
Pete,Okay.
Toby,Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
Kevin,I love this hog mama.
Phyllis,"Dwight said it's ""Hog maw."""
Kevin,What is maw?!
Phyllis,It's the lining of the stomach of--
Dwight,"Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!"
Jim,"Yes, he is finally nigh."
Dwight,I am nigh!
Dwight,"Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel."
Dwight,"Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! Ohh...Too much strudel."
Jim,"So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse."
Dwight,"No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel."
Jim,Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
Pam,And the fear.
Dwight,"Yes, exactly!"
Phyllis,"Come on, Dwight, you're making this up."
Dwight,No.
Oscar,"This is a real thing. ""Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany."""
Angela,Huh.
Pam,Wow.
Dwight,"Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?"
Oscar,"""His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface."""
Stanley,"Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No."
Dwight,"Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys."
Pete,"Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?"
Erin,Mm.
Darryl,"Jim, that guy. You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? It's awful."
Dwight,Take a bowl and pass it down.
Phyllis,"Thank you, Dwight. These are nice."
Dwight,"No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable."
Jim,"Oh, it's like naughty or nice."
Dwight,"No, impish or admirable."
Jim,"Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?"
Dwight,I decided earlier.
Jim,"Oh, nice. Did you check that list?"
Dwight,Of course I checked it.
Jim,But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
Dwight,I checked it more than once.
Jim,"Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--"
Dwight,Impish or admirable.
Jim,Damn.
Dwight,Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. There you are.
Phyllis,Oh. What are these?
Dwight,It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
Phyllis,I'd rather have the bowl.
Dwight,"You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year...as impish!"
Oscar,Ow! You hit people with that thing?
Dwight,"No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder"
Jim,Ooh.
Pam,Mouse trap.
Dwight,"In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel."
Jim,"Oh, you know what? I gotta go."
Dwight,Stop giggling.
Pam,"Oh, really? Already?"
Jim,"Yeah, it's all right."
Dwight,"It's a punishment. Hey, where are you going?"
Jim,I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Dwight,But you work tomorrow.
Jim,"Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep."
Dwight,But we were gonna break the pig rib.
Jim,Ooh.
Dwight,Remember?
Jim,That's right.
Dwight,No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
Jim,"Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody."
Dwight,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?"
Jim,You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
Dwight,Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.
Jim,Ooh! Are you nuts?
Dwight,I judge you impish!
Jim,"Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard."
Dwight,They're not abandoning the party.
Jim,Just--Just--Hey!
Jim,"That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!"
Dwight,Impish!
Jim,Aah! Ow!
Meredith,"Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too."
Jim,Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. One second. Oh...
Pam,Well...this is it.
Jim,I'm probably never gonna see you again.
Pam,Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
Jim,"Okay, sorry, sorry."
Pam,I can't believe this is actually happening.
Jim,"Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck."
Pam,Okay. Good luck. You're gonna be great.
Jim,I'll call you when I get in.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,All right.
Pam,Love you.
Jim,Love you.
Kevin,"To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops."
Pam,"Meredith, I am so sorry about today."
Jim,I think they're going to the conference finals.
Meredith,Forget about it.
Kevin,No.
Pam,"I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it."
Jim,"Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-..."
Meredith,Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Jim,I bit my lip at lunch today.
Pam,"Get it, girl!"
Darryl,"Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough."
Pam,This one's for all you ladies out there.
Kevin,"Oh, the Nets are super tough."
Meredith,I come...
Jim,Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
Pam,Not yet.
Kevin,The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
Both,"I come home in the middle of the night. My mother says when you gonna live your life right? Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they want to have fun. Oh girls just want to have fun."
Jim,"Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the..."
Jim,"Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!"
Erin,"Good morning, Meredith."
Pam,What?
Erin,"Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes."
Pam,"Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family."
Jim,"I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos."
Jim,You sound tired. Everything ok?
Pam,Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Jim,"Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?"
Worker,"Jim, limo's here."
Jim,"Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting."
Pam,"Oh, call me later!"
Jim,Ok
Pam,Good luck!
Jim,Thanks!
Pam,Love you.
Jim,Love you too. Bye.
Val,How you doing?
Darryl,"Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so..."
Val,It's how it has to be.
Darryl,"I know, I know. It's just hard."
Darryl,"Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, ""What are you gonna do, breakup with me?"" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight."
Darryl,"I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it."
Val,Me neither. Come here.
Pam,"Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today."
Meredith,Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Pam,He didn't leave me. He just went part time. Can you just fill out the form please?
Meredith,Yes.
Pam,"I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens."
Meredith,Hurry up already.
Erin,"Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times."
Erin,"Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!"
Angela,"Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?"
Dwight,"What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine."
Pam,"Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly."
Dwight,Just lice Pam?
Dwight,"Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7."
Dwight,"Make way, nope, inspect me."
Erin,"Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear."
Dwight,Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.
Pam,Stop that!
Angela,Dwight!
Erin,Next!
Angela,"Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies."
Pam,"Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault."
Oscar,"Pam, really? Come on."
Meredith,"Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen."
Erin,Lice. More lice. Angela has lice.
Angela,Ew! Oh.
Erin,"Ooh yabber, lice!"
Erin,"Yikers, lice."
Pam,No! How? I'm so clean!
Erin,"Oh yeah, big time lice."
Oscar,"I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith."
Phyllis,What are you wearing?
Dwight,"It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?"
Nellie,No.
Kevin,No.
Dwight,"Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch."
Darryl,"Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up."
Phyllis,You got dumped?
Darryl,"Yeah, she ended things."
Nellie,"Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink."
Kevin,Here man. You need that more than me.
Darryl,"Thanks, man."
Kevin,Yeah
Pam,"Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her."
Angela,"Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame."
Stanley,That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
Erin,No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!
Stanley,Get off me!
Erin,I'm trying to save you from yourself!
Stanley,"Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls."
Pam,"Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me."
Jim,"Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?"
Limo Driver,"Yeah, take some home if you want."
Jim,"Oh no, no, no. That's ok. Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?"
Limo Driver,"No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court."
Jim,You gotta be kidding me.
Pam,"Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something."
Meredith,"Yes, Pam what do you want?"
Pam,"Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?"
Meredith,"Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice."
Pam,Oh stop! I am so sorry!
Meredith,"Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?"
Pam,Nothing.
Pam,"I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this."
Dwight,"Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!"
Erin,"No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats..."
Dwight,To be burned!
Erin,To be washed.
Angela,What do we do about our heads?
Dwight,I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
Erin,"No, all we need is mayonnaise."
Angela,Excuse me?
Pam,"She's right, it works. I would imagine."
Erin,"Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos."
Oscar,"I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce."
Meredith,Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Angela,Oh.
Oscar,Wow.
Meredith,Take a picture. It will last longer.
Angela,We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
Creed,Bald people make me sick.
Meredith,"Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss."
Erin,"Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now."
Pam,"Oh! Uh, uh I'll go."
Angela,"Okay. Oh, thank you."
Oscar,"You're a saint, Pam."
Pam,"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?"
Meredith,Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Pam,Okay.
Dwight,"Let's talk pubes, people."
Val,"Hey, Darryl."
Darryl,"Oh, hey Val."
Nellie,"Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other."
Darryl,Yeah.
Phyllis,"What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?"
Darryl,"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head."
Nellie,"Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this."
Kevin,"I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake."
Phyllis,"Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake."
Nellie,"Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most."
Kevin,An Escalade.
Nellie,Or what's her name.
Phyllis,Val.
Nellie,Let's get Darryl Val.
Julius Irving,I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk.
Jim,Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
Julius,"Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?"
Jim,"Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball."
Julius,"Okay. Wow, Halpert's got game."
Jim,"Alright. Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?"
Julius,It's your wife? You better take it.
Jim,"Right! Hey, what's up? Everything ok?"
Pam,"Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went."
Jim,"It's still happening right now actually, so uh..."
Pam,"He's really making you work for it, huh?"
Jim,"Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?"
Pam,"Great. I am killing it over here. Jim, I gotta go."
Jim,"Okay, bye. So sorry about that."
Julius,"No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think?"
Jim,I love it.
Erin,"Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away."
Dwight,"Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right."
Stanley,Put those away before you hurt yourself.
Dwight,"Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!"
Erin,"Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up."
Angela,"Oscar, do you want to be my partner?"
Oscar,"Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to.."
Creed,"Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?"
Erin,"Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?"
Pete,"Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man."
Pam,"Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?"
Creed,Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
Oscar,Angela.
Angela,You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
Meredith,You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
Pam,"Creed, I'm all done. My turn."
Creed,"I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy."
Pam,"Well, wait."
Pete,How's that?
Erin,I feel it working. Eiffel tower!
Val,Can I help you?
Phyllis,"Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl."
Val,"Yeah, that's true."
Phyllis,"We think you made a big, big mistake."
Kevin,Big mistake.
Nellie,Quite enormous.
Phyllis,He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Val,"Ok, thank you. Is that all?"
Nellie,"No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?"
Val,"Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?"
Kevin,So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
Val,No.
Kevin,"Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever."
Val,"Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out."
Pam,Hello?
Helene,"Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice."
Pam,"What, no. That can't...I don't..."
Helene,"Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like..."
Angela,Oh my God.
Meredith,Shave her head. Shave her head!
Pam,"You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that..."
Meredith,"Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall."
Dwight,She's right Pam.
Pam,Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Dwight,Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
Pam,"Meredith, I am so sorry."
Angela,"Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster."
Pam,I meant to say something earlier. I just...
Meredith,Just? Just what? Just forgot?
Meredith,"Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam."
Dwight,"Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as..."
Erin,"Dwight, are you okay!?"
Dwight,"Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple."
Erin,Wow. He got to purple.
Oscar,Ow!
Angela,Sorry.
Oscar,You're waterboarding me!
Angela,Oops.
Kevin,"No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay."
Erin,You're up.
Pete,"Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go."
Erin,"You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out."
Pete,Okay.
Erin,Okay. Okay. Is that too cold?
Pete,"No, it actually feels kinda nice."
Kevin,I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time.
Val,Okay.
Darryl,Huh?
Val,Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
Darryl,"Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do."
Val,You're not. I believe in us.
Darryl,But...
Darryl,I'm back together with Val. Yay...
Dwight,"I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere."
Pete,"Hey, did Erin already take off?"
Oscar,I guess so.
Pete,Okay.
Julius,"You're Kareem, coming to help."
Jim,"Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud."
Julius,And it went like this.
Jim,And that's all?
Julius,That's it.
Jim,"No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done."
Julius,"Yeah, you show me how."
Jim,"This is Jim Halpert, leave a message."
Pam,"Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you."
Meredith,"Hey, what you doing right now?"
Pam,I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
Meredith,Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
Pam,Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
Meredith,No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
Oscar,"Kevin, move. I can't pull up the rug if you're standing on it with your rhinoceros feet."
New Instant Message,Stone & Son Suit Warehouse contract expired with their paper provider! Go get it! â€“David Wallace
Kevin,Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Dwight,"Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family â€“ brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew."
Angela,"Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?"
Dwight,"I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of ""Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire""."
Nellie,"Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don't you just have some more coffee?"
Jim,"Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy."
Stanley,It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
Dwight,"Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky."
Creed,I saw the leaves twitch!
Jim,"Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something."
Angela,Shut up!
Dwight,"Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity."
Creed,You shut up!
Phyllis,"I have ears, Dwight."
Oscar,Everybody shut up and work!
Dwight,"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?"
Phyllis,We don't work for you!
Jim,"Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now."
Kevin,Yeah!
Dwight,How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Angela,Yeah!
Jim,Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Stanley,"Hey, it's five o'clock."
Dwight,"Mmm. That's a good... question. 300 times... 180... Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you."
Oscar,"Kevin, can-"
Nellie,"Darryl, looking good!"
Angela,What's going on?
Darryl,Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company.
Dwight,Yes! We did it!
Pam,"Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?"
Clark,You opened the door-
Darryl,Why don't you come along and tell him yourself?
Dwight,And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha!
Pam,"Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get... What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?"
Clark,"Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?"
Erin,"Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details."
Dwight,You got me! I used to collect them!
Pam,"A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order."
Clark,Why?
Erin,"What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it's in order? I haven't been trained for this."
Dwight,"Each one is very different, like a snowflake."
Pam,"Okay, see you later."
Pam,Hey... What happened here?
Clark,Hey guys.
Erin,"You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That's what happened. The pens happened."
Phyllis,Clark!
Pam,...Are the pens here?
Meredith,Hey!
Oscar,"Hey, look who's back, Dwight Junior."
Kevin,"Hey, so how was it? I mean... the s*x with Jan."
Clark,A gentleman doesn't discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
Clark,Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was... like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh... like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
Meredith,"Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ""Talk classy, act nasty""."
Clark,What's with the wig Meredith?
Meredith,"What, is it on backwards?"
Clark,"Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It's an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so... bon appetite."
Phyllis,Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that's Italian.
Oscar,My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Meredith,Always with the friends Oscar. Can't we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Oscar,"Actually, it's pronounced ""espresso""... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So..."
Dwight,"There he is! We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but..."
Clark,"If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission."
Dwight,"Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh... No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?"
Clark,I loved it.
Dwight,How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Clark,"If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend."
Dwight,Then looks like we have a deal... Son
Erin,Hi guys!
Pete,"Hey, look who it is!"
Erin,"Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose."
Oscar,Try this one.
Erin,Thank you!
Erin,"I don't really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone's trust. About the pens."
Pam,You ready for your interview?
Darryl,"I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy's job in the bag until my interview."
Pam,"Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim."
Darryl,"Yeah, I guess..."
Pam,"Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically Gumby with hair."
Suit Store Father,"It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store."
Dwight,"You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy?"
Clark,"No, we sure hadn't Pop."
Dwight,"Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?"
Clark,He calls me Clarky â€˜cause he's my Dad.
Dwight,Guilty!
Suit Store Father,You don't meet many hunters these days.
Clark,"My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial killer... of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!"
Dwight,"It was his birthday, just turned three. So..."
Suit Store Father,Ahh...
Oscar,"You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?"
Nellie,"No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?"
Kevin,Taste test? I'm in!
Oscar,YOLO!
Phyllis,What?
Oscar,"It's a thing. It means ""you only live once""."
Kevin,"Yeah, we're aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it."
Oscar,Well...
Kevin,"Alright everybody, who's in? Angela? Don't make us come over there."
Angela,"No, I don't... no."
Kevin,"Alright, let's go."
Angela,Can't I just agree without putting my hand in?
Nellie,Absolutely not!
Kevin,No way.
Angela,"Oh, fine."
Kevin,"Ok guys, ""we all drink them all""."
Everyone,We all drink them all!
Kevin,Yes!
Oscar,Yes!
Nellie,Whoo!
Phyllis,"Hey, where's my ring?"
Creed,I'm sure it'll turn up.
Athlead Employee,"Yes ma'am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. You'll see us on the right side, you can't miss us."
Dennis,...And I want to reach every demographic possible.
Jim,"No, I hear what you're saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?"
Dennis,"We're talking weeks here, not months, right?"
Jim,"Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago."
Dennis,Alright. Good.
Jim,"Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. Hey! How are you?"
Pam,Good!
Jim,What are you doing here?
Pam,I just wanted to see you!
Jim,That's so great!
Darryl,"Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!"
Jim,"It's pretty great, right? I mean, we're coming along... Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis's timeline"
Wade,Okay
Jim,"Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home."
Dwight,"...But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy, does whatever I say."
Suit Store Father,"I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts."
Dwight,Oh... really.
Suit Store Father,"Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?"
Dwight,"Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son."
Clark,"Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but... God I missed you!"
Dwight,"What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?"
Clark,"I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool."
Dwight,You're being disrespectful!
Clark,"...And I love you, for saying that."
Dwight,We don't get along.
Clark,Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is... our relationship is... terr-
Dwight,Terrible!
Clark,Terrible.
Dwight,"Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!"
Pam,"Wow, this place is... so great. I had no idea â€“ on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky."
Jim,"Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so... These things go down all the time."
Darryl,"If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it."
Jim,Are you cool to just hang out?
Pam,"Sure, no problem."
Jim,Yeah? You ready?
Darryl,Yeah.
Jim,Let's do it!
Erin,"The pen delivery went amazing, and now I've got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I'm not one of those people who's just like, ""Uh, sure. I'll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back's turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand... they are just sitting here. Pam didn't tell me not to unpack them. Don't want to be a busybody, but I don't want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it's insane! I'm sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I've never had an espresso before. They're good though."
Nellie,A-bam! My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I've tried so far is Alpine Select!
Kevin,Yes!
Angela,Ugh!
Kevin,One!
Angela,Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
Kevin,Two...
Angela,Stop it!
Kevin,Three...
Oscar,That's enough Kevin.
Angela,Stop it Kevin!
Kevin,Four!
Oscar,That's enough!
Angela,Kevin!
Clark,"So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing."
Suit Store Father,I heard that before...
Clark,"Well, I understand, but â€“"
Dwight,"I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son."
Clark,"Here we go again, another lecture from the old man."
Suit Store Father,Listen to him. He created you.
Dwight,"Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you."
Clark,Women don't despise me...
Dwight,"His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it."
Clark,"Alright, that's enough, â€˜cause I can say some things about him too."
Dwight,Yeah? Like what?
Clark,"Like the time that you got drunk and, and then... Killed those kids on their way to prom!"
Dwight,"That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ""saving treats"" from the kitty litter box."
Suit Store Father,Really shameful...
Clark,So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Dwight,Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
Clark,"There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you-"
Dwight,"Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ""please kitty, may I have some more?"" You can't make this stuff up!"
Clark,"No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends."
Suit Store Son,"Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting."
Suit Store Father,"Here he is, my son."
Dwight,Got cat turd collector written all over him.
Suit Store Son,...Did you say cat turd collector?
Athlead Employee,"...So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we're just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, that's not a mandate."
Darryl,"""Mandate""- Always think of two men on a date. I have gay friends... I have one gay friend. Oscar?"
Jim,Mm-hm
Athlead Employee,"Alright, so what makes you think you'd be a good fit here?"
Darryl,"Ummm... Alright. Obviously y'all look really busy, and uh, I don't want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh... Obviously I'm not qualified to be here man, I'm... I'm a warehouse manager, you know..."
Athlead Employee,"Darryl, I was a newspaper editor."
Female Athlead Employee,"Science teacher, volleyball coach."
3rd Athlead Employee,I work at a home shopping network.
4th Athlead Employee,I'm a laywer. I'm the only one here who can honestly help.
Jim,"And as you know, I was a paper salesman. Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked."
Darryl,"Cool. Hey, thanks..."
Athlead Employee,"So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company?"
Darryl,"Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh... I wrote some down. There you go. Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me!"
Stanley,"Ah! So, this is what 2"
Stanley,I usually take a siesta about now.
Pete,"Stocking pens, huh? You're like the new office administrator."
Erin,"No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it's the truth, I swear."
Kevin,"Pam! Pam, look out! Erin's gunning for your job!"
Erin,"No, I'm not! It's not like that at all! Forget it, I'm so sorry."
Kevin,"Pam, look out!"
Erin,"Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you've had."
Athlead Employee,"By the way, Jim talks about you all the time."
Pam,That's sweet that he talks about me.
Athlead Employee,It's too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though...
Pam,"Well, that's funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia."
Athlead Employee,We can't wait until you move here.
Suit Store Son,"I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?"
Dwight,Do you mind? The men are talking.
Suit Store Father,Sons used to idolize their fathers.
Dwight,Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
Suit Store Father,"I'd love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I'm just here for human contract."
Suit Store Son,Okay Pop...
Dwight,"Wait, so you're the boss?"
Suit Store Son,That's right.
Clark,"Hi, I'm Clark."
Suit Store Son,Hey.
Clark,Let's talk.
Suit Store Son,Okay.
Clark,So if you look at our catalog here...
Athlead Employee,"Well, thanks for coming down Darryl."
Female Athlead Employee,"It was nice meeting you Darryl, I think you'd fit in great here."
Darryl,"Yeah, yeah me too. I think it'd be like... You know what? I think it'd be like a Kevin Durant jump shot... Perfecto! Oh my god..."
Pam,"They're the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece."
Darryl,So I'm like a three year old girl in this scenario...
Pam,Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
Darryl,"And I'd only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I'm... I'm not so sure I'd like living in Philadelphia."
Pam,Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London.
Darryl,Who needs it?
Pam,Not us.
Jim,"Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They're going to make you pay for the fish, and... they wanted to know when you can start."
Darryl,What? How about yesterday?
Pam,Congratulations.
Darryl,"Oh, thank you."
Pam,I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
Darryl,"Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!"
Pam,"No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl... Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him."
Kevin,It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Oscar,It's insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
Angela,I don't get the point of this stupid window!
Clark,"I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad's suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That's why his face always breaks out."
Suit Store Son,Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher?
Clark,"You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I'm going to need one right? If I'm ever going to get a ""real job"" and move my ""lazy ass"" out of your ""G.D. house""."
Suit Store Son,He's got you there...
Suit Store Son,That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful... Although expensive.
Dwight,"Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island."
Clark,"Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island."
Dwight,"That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?"
Clark,How do I look?
Dwight,Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too.
Oscar,"Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don't we move the copier into the annex like we've always wanted to?"
Nellie,Whoo!
Meredith,Frickin' A!
Oscar,Huh?
Kevin,"So long, noise!"
Oscar,"One, two, three!"
Nellie,"And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble!"
Oscar,"Wait! It's beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it."
Meredith,Tear up the carpet!
Nellie,Whoo!
Darryl,"Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That's how you do that, baby. It's all good, I'm ready. Y'all ready for this?"
Pam,Everybody dance now...
Dwight,"Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ""Scranton Mimeograph Corp?"" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd.  A letter from Robert Dunder. ""A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance."" The Holy Grail."
Creed,Night
Pam,
Pam,"Night, Creed."
Jim,"I think I'm a little too busy these days to s--- Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail."
Jim,The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
Pam,Hey.
Kevin,I don't get it.
Jim,Hey.
Dwight,Aha! A lightbulb.
Pam,"So, how's it going?"
Kevin,A lightbul--
Jim,"We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it."
Dwight,A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. Invisible ink.
Pam,I'm so sorry.
Kevin,Whoa.
Jim,"I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks."
Dwight,"""Higher than numbers go."" The ceiling above accounting!"
Pam,"Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard."
Angela,"Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!"
Jim,Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
Jim,
Pam,"Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all."
Jim,...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
Jim,"You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?"
Pam,You don't remember?
Pam,"No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part."
Jim,I don't.
Jim,"Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how."
Dwight,"An ""X."""
Pam,"Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it."
Oscar,Annex. It must open something in the annex.
Jim,"Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video."
Dwight,Oh.
Pam,Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
Kevin,Whoa.
Jim,"Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it."
Dwight,"""Sedes introiti."" Seat of entrance."
Pam,"I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there."
Dwight,
Jim,"You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this."
Pete,What?
Pam,You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
Oscar,What?
Jim,"Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again."
Kevin,That's a flush.
Co-worker,Jim. We need you.
All,
Jim,"I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something..."
All,The warehouse.
Pam,"I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want."
Pam,There's nothing down here.
Jim,"I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?"
Jim,"Oh, I expected more from young Halpert."
Pam,Yep.
Dwight,Let's just forget it. Forget it.
Jim,We'll talk tomorrow?
Nellie,"So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?"
Pam,Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Erin,"Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack."
Jim,Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Nellie,Wow.
Pam,Bye.
Erin,It's just Pete in sunglasses.
Brian,"Hey, you okay?"
Nellie,Oh.
Pam,"What am I doing wrong, Brian?"
Erin,"And then we had him ""Like"" Dunder Mifflin."
Brian,Nothing. You're doing the best you can.
Pete,"Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ""Like"" Derek's ""Likes."""
Cameraman,Brian.
Erin,"So far, we're only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big."
Brian,Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
Nellie,You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
Pam,
Erin,All right.
Brian,"Hey, it's just a tough situation, all right?"
Erin,Pete and I work well together -- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
Pam,It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard.
Jim,Hey.
Brian,"Yeah. Let's turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough."
Co-worker,Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.
Pam,Thank you.
Jim,"Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later."
Guy,Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Co-worker #2,Uh sure. No problem.
Darryl,
Jim,"Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right?"
Guy,"I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah."
Dwight,"Pfft, ""Athlead""? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ""Stumpany,"" for ""Stupid Company."""
Darryl,And replay.
Darryl,"Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it."
Guy,"Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah."
Dwight,"You're working for ""Stumpany"" too?"
Darryl,I'm gonna miss the paper business.
Darryl,"Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over."
Dwight,What?
Darryl,Yep.
Dwight,"Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?"
Jim,"Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity."
Dwight,You won't stop until you've poached us all.
Jim,Yeah. Even you.
Dwight,No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.
Jim,"Bye, Dwight."
Jim,Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
Pam,"Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?"
Kevin,"Ooh, I haven't heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?"
Pam,"Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind."
Angela,"I have no information. But I'm sure as soon as they know, they'll call you."
Pam,"Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?"
Pam,"Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital."
Oscar,Aw.
Pam,"Hey, Cece, Daddy's gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?"
Cece,Yeah.
Pam,Let's call him.
Jim,Hey. I was just about to call you.
Pam,"Hey, Hon, are you close?"
Jim,"I am still in Philly, actually."
Pam,What?
Jim,"It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board."
Pam,"Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it."
Jim,"Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call."
Cece,I want Daddy.
Jim,"You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?"
Pam,Of course.
Jim,Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
Pam,"Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something."
Jim,"Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone."
Pam,"I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ""Bye, Daddy."""
Cece,"Bye, Daddy."
Jim,"Bye. Yep. See, you've still got to press ""End,"" Pam."
Cece,"Press ""End."""
Pete,"Oh, check it out. This is our first real ""Like."""
Erin,"Oh, my gosh!"
Pete,"Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific."
Erin,Wow. That guy's really into paper.
Pete,Yeah.
Nellie,"Well done, you two."
Erin,We did it. Youth task force forever.
Pete,Yes.
Pete,"Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?"
Erin,"No, you go -- okay."
Pete,"All right, all right.Okay, start over."
Nellie,"Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  ""Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously."" I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie."
Dwight,"Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below."
All,
Dwight,You're welcome.
Phyllis,"Wait. This says ""Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge""?"
Dwight,"This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want."
Oscar,"""Loyalty pledge""?"
Darryl,"Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows."
Dwight,"Yeah, we'll see about that."
Dwight,"Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ""Infuriating, irresponsible""..."
Clark,"They got us set up with Windows 95,  so you're kind of dreaming here."
Dwight,"Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out."
Dwight,Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?
Kevin,"Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches."
Dwight,Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
Mr. Romanko,I wouldn't say a rage.
Darryl,"Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It's very unlikely it would happen again."
Mr. Romanko,Thank you. Thank you.
Dwight,"No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl?  L--"
Darryl,Loyalty.
Dwight,Loyalty.
Nellie,Loyalty is exactly right.
Dwight,Thank you.
Nellie,"Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let's all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?"
Stanley,That's none of your damn business.
Nellie,"Darryl is ""dating"" Dunder Mifflin."
Darryl,Darryl is dating Val... still.
Nellie,But he's flirting with Jim's company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
Mr. Romanko,I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?
Dwight,Yes.
Nellie,"I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean."
Dwight,Yeah.
Nellie,"So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?"
Creed,Let's try it out.
Nellie,"No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X."
Angela,"Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy."
Erin,"Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy?"
Angela,Yes. And he didn't like it.
Phyllis,"Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?"
Kevin,"Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with?"
Dance Teacher,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas."
Ballerinas,"One, two, three."
Parent in Audience,Really?
Pam,"Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry."
Ballerinas,"One, two, three."
Pam,"Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? Oh, my God!"
Audience,Shh!
Pam,"Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you."
Parent in audience #2,You're very rude.
Parent in audience #1,"Yes, very rude."
Pam,Shh! Kids are dancing.
Dwight,"Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?"
Darryl,"Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that."
Dwight,It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Darryl,It can.
Dwight,"Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?"
Phyllis,"Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas Pete - he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird."
Erin,I'm just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven't done anything.
Meredith,"Yeah right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers."
Oscar,"People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?"
Erin,"Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?"
Pete,"That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?"
Kevin,Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your pen1s.
All,
Erin,"Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force."
Nellie,"I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah."
Nellie,"Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You're welcome, Andy. And you're welcome, my own ass."
Investor,"Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me."
Co-worker,"Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?"
Jim,"Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--"
Jim,"Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second."
Pam,"Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something."
Lonnie,"Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery."
Darryl,I don't do that anymore.
Lonnie,That's what they told me.
Darryl,
Darryl,"All right, let's get this over with."
Dwight,You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! Here we go! Yeah!
Dwight,"Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!"
Darryl,How far is this place?
Dwight,"Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports."
Darryl,Fun.
Toby,"Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there."
Nellie,"Oh, thank you. I don't know, I sort of thought--"
Toby,"So proud of you, Hon."
Nellie,"Oh, I don't know. Okay."
Toby,"I'm just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?"
Nellie,"Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one."
Toby,"Pete's a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat."
Nellie,I didn't really think about it like that.
Toby,"Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have."
Nellie,"""What we have""?"
Toby,Mm-hmm.
Nellie,"I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no."
Dwight,Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
Darryl,They have fast food in Philly.
Dwight,Not like this.
Darryl,Exactly like this.
Fast Food Worker,And your milkshake.
Dwight,Thank you.
Darryl,It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?
Dwight,"Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!"
Dwight,"Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go."
Darryl,You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
Dwight,"It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming."
Pam,Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital?
Angela,"Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that."
Oscar,I'll watch it. Let's get this over with.
Pam,"All right, you don't have to."
Kevin,"Let's get this over with, Pam."
Pam,Okay.
Oscar,Oh.
Pam,Wait. What?
Pam,"Excuse me, I have to get back to work."
Pam,"Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off."
Oscar,User error. I've heard of that happening to other people.
Angela,"Oscar, don't rub it in. I'm sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child."
Pam,"Well, it was an important phone call."
Pam,"I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, ""Beesly!"" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ""Beesly!"""
Pete,Hey.
Erin,"Hello, Peter."
Dwight,It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
Darryl,You missed a spot.
Drive Thru Customer,Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Dwight,"Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!"
Nellie,I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
Erin,"Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea."
Nellie,"Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it."
Pete,"Well, okay, then."
Erin,I guess we don't have a choice.
Nellie,Nope.
Pete,yeah.
Erin,Yeah.
Toby,Lady...you never stop surprising me.
Dwight,
Darryl,
Dwight,What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
Darryl,No. I was clearing my throat.
Meredith,Good night.
Pam,Night
Pam,"Hey Brian, you got a sec?"
Dwight,"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?"
Brian,"Yeah, hold on a sec."
Trevor,And what are we supposed to do until then?
Pam,I feel awful.
Dwight,Okay.
Brian,It's fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you.
Wolf,"Let's just go, you guys."
Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin."
Rolf,"Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?"
Pam,"Well, thanks for being a good friend."
Jim,All right. I think that went well.
Brian,"Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?"
Jim,"So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print outâ€”Hey. Meet your new desk mate."
Pam,"Yeah, mostly."
Clark,What's up good lookin'?
Erin,"Pam, phone call."
Pam,"Oh, cool. Hey Clark."
Pam,"Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa."
Jim,"Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering."
Brian,Will do.
Pam,"Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate."
Pam,Okay. Thank you.
Jim,Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.
Brian,Sure.
Pam,Of course.
Meredith,"Hey, boom guy."
Jim,I'll call you when I get there.
Brian,"Oh, hey Meredith."
Pam,Okay.
Meredith,When are you gonna boom me?
Jim,All right.
Brian,"Uh, listen, they're cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It's a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna... I, I'll see you later."
Pam,Bye.
Meredith,Got it.
Jim,Take care of my wife. I will be back.
Clark,"Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?"
Dwight,They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
Dwight,"That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride."
Clark,"Hey, Pam, I'm going to the kitchen. You want anything?"
Clark,"Well, uh... see, you raised it."
Pam,I'm good.
Dwight,"Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did."
Dwight,"Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee."
Dwight,"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, ""Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses."" Wow."
Clark,"Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee."
Clark,"You know what, man? I deserve this job."
Dwight,
Dwight,Mm-hmm.
Pam,"Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?"
Clark,"I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under."
Dwight,"Who, me?"
Dwight,"You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance."
Pam,Us.
Dwight,"Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor â€“ he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants."
Dwight,"Absolutely, I do."
Clark,"This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome."
Pam,"Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that."
Dwight,Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
Dwight,"Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great."
Jim,"You could've just called that an alliance too, right?"
Pam,
Dwight,I chose my words very carefully.
Pam & Dwight,
Jim,"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse."
Dwight,Aah!
Clark,You interviewing for the sales job too?
Clark,No!
Rolf,No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.
Dwight,"Welcome to the club, pig!"
Clark,"Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, I've been working here 12 weeks. That's a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we've seen."
Pam,"No, Dwight!"
Rolf,I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl.
Dwight,Aah!
Clark,Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
Jim,"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does."
Rolf,Go to hell.
Clark,There he is.
Dwight,"Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor."
Rolf,Nice.
Dwight,"Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy."
Pam,When are you talking to David Wallace?
Jim,"I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up."
Pam,Too late. My hopes are up.
Jim,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix â€“ me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys."
Dwight,And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
Jim,I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.
Dwight,No doy!
Jim,I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.
Rolf,"I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds."
Dwight,No earbuds!
Jim,I'm sure he's just nervous.
Pam,It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.
Dwight,"So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything."
Rolf,"Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?"
Dwight,"Well, I'm the one offering the job."
Rolf,What are your credentials?
Dwight,I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Rolf,I think I've heard everything I need to hear.
Dwight,"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference."
Rolf,"Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch."
Dwight,"Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, ""Jump,"" and he says, ""Oh who?"" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor."
Dwight,What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
Trevor,"Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it."
Dwight,"Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman."
Trevor,Pass. Next one.
Dwight,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Trevor,"No, no and no."
Dwight,There were only two options.
Trevor,"Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?"
Dwight,This is a bus transfer.
Trevor,Nothing gets by this guy.
Clark,"Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?"
Jim,"Sure, yeah, go ahead."
Clark,"Thanks, dude. Youâ€”you sure it's okay? â€˜Cause you're kindaâ€”"
Jim,"Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?"
Clark,"Oh, Dove Men."
Jim,"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, soâ€”"
Clark,"Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?"
Jim,"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do."
Clark,"Thanks, dude."
Jim,Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
Clark,Why?
Jim,I need you to breathe in my face right now.
Clark,
Jim,"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?"
Clark,Wintergreen.
Jim,"I knew it, I knew it."
Clark,"Yeah, good nose."
Jim,"I looked at you coming around, and I said, ""Wintergreen."""
Dwight,"I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly."
Dwight,"Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party."
Clark,That's just a classic no-win situation.
Dwight,Thank you.
Clark,So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.
Dwight,"Damn it! Perfect answer, again."
Clark,Yep.
Dwight,"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ..."
Clark,"You know what, Dwight?"
Dwight,And anothâ€”
Clark,"This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process."
Dwight,No.
Clark,Yeah. Star Trek rules.
Dwight,"It does, but still no."
Clark,"Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?"
Dwight,"Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here."
Stanley,This is not natural.
Oscar,Just â€“ I don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances.
Pam,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?"
Darryl,They smell so bad.
Meredith,"If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right?"
Kevin,"Meredith, I tell you all the time."
Meredith,Walked right into that one.
Dwight,"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise."
Dwight,What quality would make you a good sales associate?
Mose,People person.
Dwight,It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
Mose,That's right.
Dwight,"You know we live together, right?"
Mose,Yes.
Dwight,"And I've never seen you go to work, ever."
Mose,Okay.
Dwight,So why is this on your resume?
Clark,So how'd you guys hear about the position?
Gabor,Myâ€”my mom.
Nate,"Dwight called my house, but he didn't realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can't stay out of her stuff."
Zeke,"Dwight's my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower."
Clark,You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
Zeke,"Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's like, a ton of people in there."
Clark,So you guys all know Dwight already?
Melvina,"I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby."
Gabor,I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school.
Melvina,You went to X-Men school too?
Clark,X-Men school?
Dwight,"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out."
Gabor,"Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi's. A lot of telemarketing."
Angela,I don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
Stanley,I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn't work then. And now look what he's doing to us.
Nellie,"Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault."
Jim,How is it my fault?
Nellie,"Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others."
Jim,But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.
Oscar,"Yeah, but Jim, Dwight's a weirdo. We can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos."
Pam,"Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off."
David Wallace,"Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later."
Jim,"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputâ€”"
Dwight,This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.
David Wallace,"Hey, Dwight. It's David."
Dwight,David.
David Wallace,Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process.
Dwight,"Really? That's interesting. â€˜Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately."
Jim,"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wifeâ€”"
David Wallace,"Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work."
Jim,Oh. Um...
David Wallace,Yeah.
Jim,Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.
Dwight,"Sounds fair to me, David."
David Wallace,And I know we have a call scheduled for later â€“
Jim,"Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later."
Dwight,No. Why not do it now?
David Wallace,Yeah. What's up Jim?
Jim,"Uh... Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?"
Dwight,"I'd love to be in the loop, David."
David Wallace,"It's okay. Go ahead, Jim."
Jim,There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor â€“
David Wallace,"Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there."
Jim,"Yes, okay. Bye."
Dwight,I'd love to invest.
Jim,"No, thanks."
Dwight,I'd like to give you $100 million.
Hide,Why you make trees into bushes? You don't make paper from bushes.
Pam,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?"
Hide,Thank you.
Pam,Yeah.
Troy,Whoops.
Zeke,It's dense. Like bread.
Jim,"Dwight, you can't just hire someone â€˜cause they're your friend."
Dwight,I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
Nellie,"They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks."
Dwight,You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Darryl,"Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into m*st*rb*t*ng."
Wolf,"Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch."
Dwight,"Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch."
Dwight,"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of â€˜em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof."
Dwight,Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Wolf,Do you want this paper?
Dwight,I sure do.
Wolf,It's not very good.
Dwight,I will pay you whatever it takes.
Wolf,I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.
Dwight,"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money."
Wolf,Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over.
Dwight,Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?
Wolf,I am.
Dwight,"Okay. Good, good, good."
Hide,I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.
Dwight,This isn't gonna work out.
Hide,Thank you.
Dwight,"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps"
Dwight,"No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them."
Melvina,Do you need to be changed?
Dwight,I do that myself now.
Melvina,Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.
Dwight,"No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes."
Melvina,"Well, the joke's on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas."
Trevor,"Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we're still gonna be your friend."
Wolf,"Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvinaâ€”"
Dwight,Or none of you
Wolf,"Yeah, you'd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us."
Trevor,Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.
Dwight,I wish I could hire all of you.
Zeke,I could start Monday.
Dwight,"Psst. Jim Jim? Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around."
Jim,"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say."
Dwight,Just act natural.
Dwight,And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
Jim,But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.
Dwight,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call."
Jim,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
Dwight,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
Jim,I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight,Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
Jim,"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?"
Dwight,Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
Jim,"And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you."
Sensei Ira,I'm sorry?
Dwight,What? This is such bullcrap!
Jim,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say."
Dwight,Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
Jim,Too much now.
Dwight,Okay.
Nate,"Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep."
Dwight,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever."
Jim,That seems inconsiderate.
Rolf,"No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe."
Dwight,"Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor."
Trevor,"Well, my day's shot."
Rolf,"Yeah, it's that weird hour where it's too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson's."
Wolf,I got it. Paintball.
Nellie,Have you seen Darryl?
Pam,"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers."
Erin,He's around here somewhere.
Brian,"No. No, it's..."
Nellie,Mmm.
Pam,"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me."
Erin,"Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies."
Brian,"It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that."
Erin,"Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun."
Pam,Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
Erin,Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
Brian,"No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too."
Darryl,How much did you pay for that?
Pam,"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry."
Erin,"Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe."
Brian,"Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you."
Darryl,"Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it."
Pam,"Thanks, Brian."
Erin,"Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! That guy's hilarious. He's here today."
Brian,Seeya.
Pam,"I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... Oh my god! Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? Huh? No way. No way!"
Jim,"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'."
Angela,"Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house."
Darryl,Oh. Come on!
Erin,"Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids."
Jim,Oh. Oh!
Angela,"No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors."
Darryl,Damn!
Kevin,"Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation..."
Jim,You win. How good did that feel?
Angela,"No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about."
Darryl,"That felt really good, actually."
Oscar,"Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too."
Angela,What?
Oscar,He said he wanted me there for support.
Angela,I'm his! His... wife.
Oscar,"Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. Me."
Angela,"We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too."
Jim,Hey.
Darryl,Hey.
Jim,We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
Darryl,"Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates."
Jim,"And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down."
Darryl,Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
Jim,I'm couching it!
Darryl,Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
Jim,"And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?"
Darryl,"I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to soak... He hooked me up with a job."
Pam,"Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice."
Pam,"I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian."
Jim,"Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients."
Darryl,Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
Jim,Who is this guy? We are killing it.
Darryl,Yes sir.
Jim,Yeah!
Pam,Conference room. Everybody. Now!
Dwight,You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Pam,"Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting."
Dwight,"You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?"
Pam,Yeah.
Dwight,"Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!"
Pam,I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
Erin,I thought that's what you were doing.
Pam,"Yeah, but this is different."
Erin,Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
Pam,"I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So..."
Erin,I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
Pam,"Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped."
Meredith,"Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83."
Creed,"Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage."
Oscar,"Pam, what can be done?"
Pam,Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.
Oscar,I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Pam,What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Phyllis,David Wallace called this meeting?
Pam,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art."
Pam,"No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go."
Dwight,"Pam, I'll help you."
Pam,You will?
Dwight,"If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime."
Pam,Thank you.
Nellie,"I am in too, Pam."
Pam,Yeah?
Nellie,"Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored."
Pam,Great.
Pam,"I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car."
Dwight,You need my pitchfork?
Angela,Hey!
Dwight,What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Angela,"Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you."
Dwight,"Ah, I'm not interested."
Angela,What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
Dwight,"If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics."
Kevin,"Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?"
Angela,No.
Kevin,"OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money."
Angela,"Aw, crap."
Dwight,"I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own."
Frank,You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there.
Dwight,"Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts."
Glenn,I'm not drawing a butt.
Nellie,"All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws."
Dwight,Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
Val,"OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go."
Dwight,"Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts..."
Nellie,"Well, this is getting us nowhere."
Pam,"We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him."
Dwight,We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate. Your mother is dying.
Pam,"See, I feel bad about that."
Dwight,It's all right. It's all right.
Nate,"So, she's gonna pull through again? That's great. Can I talk to her?"
Dwight,No. She needs her rest again.
Nellie,"Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business."
Dwight,"You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum."
Nate,"Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt..."
Pam,Tell us who defaced the mural!
Nate,He did it.
Pam,All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Dwight,There's no gum. There never was any gum.
Nate,That's really rude.
Kevin,"Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck."
Oscar,That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
Party Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton."
Senator,"Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular."
Angela,"Oh, Robert, you're horrible. Simon, Maxine. Who let you guys in here?"
Athlead Employee,This is the team.
Jim,"Nice job, man."
Darryl,You too... Darryl.
Jim,"What? Oh, man! I'm sorry about that."
Darryl,It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
Jim,"Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?"
Darryl,That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
Jim,"Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that."
Darryl,No big deal. No big deal.
Jim,"No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal."
Darryl,"Nah, nah..."
Jim,No big deal.
Darryl,"Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that."
Jim,"Honestly, I don't mind. Did you want me to wash it for you or..."
Darryl,I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
Jim,OK. Here ya go.
Darryl,Thank you.
Nellie,"So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?"
Pam,"Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn."
Toby,You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
Frank,I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.
Pam,"Well, I didn't think that butt was funny."
Frank,"Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours."
Pam,What was that?
Frank,"You know what? You people can't fire me. So, screw you."
Pam,Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
Toby,Uh... it... compliment...
Nellie,The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.
Toby,There were two or three 'sorry's in there.
Pam,That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
Dwight,"Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first."
Pam,We should just take him down.
Dwight,Wait. Are you saying...
Pam,I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
Dwight,"Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt."
Dwight,He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
Pam,Yes!
Dwight,A little eye for an eye action.
Pam,Yes!
Dwight,Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
Pam,We need an infiltrator.
Dwight,I know just the man for the job.
Pam,Clark?
Dwight,He even looks like a mole.
Oscar,One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
Party Guest,You two seem very close.
Senator,Yes. We're good friends. Good friends.
Oscar,Yeah.
Senator,"You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego. Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar."
Oscar,"Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian."
Darryl,"Oh, hey."
Jim,Hey.
Darryl,I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
Jim,Yeah. Totally.
Darryl,All right.
Jim,It's mine. Don't worry.
Darryl,I didn't say anything.
Jim,I don't think you had to.
Darryl,Excuse me?
Jim,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?"
Darryl,"What you need flour for, Jim?"
Jim,That's not the point.
Darryl,What? You making bread?
Jim,"No, I'm not making bread."
Darryl,What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
Jim,"Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make."
Darryl,"All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all."
Jim,It's all good. Are we all good?
Darryl,We good.
Jim,What's that cooler?
Darryl,Nothing. It's mine. What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
Jim,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?"
Dwight,I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
Clark,"Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys."
Dwight,"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work."
Clark,"OK, boss. Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this."
Pam,"Shh, shh."
Clark,This is never gonna work.
Pam,Shh. Remember your lines.
Clark,What lines?
Dwight,Go move some paper!
Pam,"Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?"
Darryl,"He's not my hire, but I know who he is."
Pam,OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
Darryl,What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
Pam,"Yeah, something like that."
Darryl,I know he loves his pick up truck.
Pam,"Oh, great! His truck!"
Dwight,Great. Get the plate number.
Pam,OK. Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
Dwight,So we know which truck to van...
Darryl,"Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?"
Pam,Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. Come on.
Party Photographer,"Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there."
Angela,He's blocking me.
Senator,"It's only a photo, honey."
Party Photographer,"Excuse me, uh, what's your name?"
Party Waiter,Sean.
Party Photographer,LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. Not you. No.
Oscar,He put me here.
Angela,He put you right in front of me?
Party Photographer,Let's just wheel Margaret right in front...
Oscar,Ow! Robert?!
Senator,Angela.
Party Photographer,Smile.
Pam,I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
Dwight,"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita."
Pam,"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet."
Dwight,Let's see yours.
Pam,"Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid."
Dwight,This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Pam,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
Dwight,I saw that. That's great!
Pam,Yeah. I feel better.
Dwight,"Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch."
Pam,"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?"
Dwight,Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his pen1s.
Pam,"I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very..."
Frank,Lady! My truck? You had no right!
Pam,"No, you had no right!"
Frank,"It's a $40,000 truck!"
Pam,So? You started it!
Frank,So? So someone need to shut you up!
Brian,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Pam,Whoa.
Brian,Easy!
Frank,You son of a bitch!
Brian,You're gonna hit a woman?
Senator,Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. Well. Have we all calmed down yet?
Oscar,Yes. Sorry about that.
Angela,It was all my fault.
Senator,"Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you."
Kevin,"Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck."
Senator,I beg your pardon.
Kevin,"You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good."
Pam,Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
Pam,Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
Jim,"It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday."
Jim,"Yeah, yeah."
Pam,Alakazam!
Pam,Thank you.
Jim,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week."
Jim,No problem.
Pam,"And, poof! He disappears."
Pam,I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
Erin,Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
Jim,You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
Pete,"Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?"
Pam,"Yeah, I do."
Erin,We can do anything you want.
Jim,"OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly."
Erin,"I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend."
Erin,Hi.
Pete,"Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved."
Pete,"Hey, you OK?"
Erin,Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
Erin,I couldn't do it.
Pete,Sure.
Pete,Oh.
Erin,Great.
Erin,I'm sorry.
Pete,I'll get my coat.
Pete,"Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK?"
Erin,Perfect.
Erin,"We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months."
Dwight,Come in.
David Wallace,"Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?"
Dwight,"Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract."
Dwight,"I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo."
Dwight,"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown."
Kevin,"Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk."
Kevin,"OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip."
Nellie,I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
Meredith,"Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences."
Phyllis,"Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness."
Stanley,"Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic."
Phyllis,Oh...
Angela,They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. They use a watch repair kit.
Kevin,Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
Nellie,"Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount."
Clark,It's what I do.
Oscar,"Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the..."
Darryl,"No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that."
Oscar,"All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my..."
Darryl,Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
Pam,These are gross.
Jim,They are terrible.
Pam,"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill."
Jim,Oh my god. That's so romantic.
Pam,It's with Brian and Alyssa.
Jim,Oh my god. That's less romantic.
Pam,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life."
Jim,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?"
Pam,That sounds nice.
Jim,"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy."
Nail stylist 1,"Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper."
Nail stylist 2,You take off your glasses.
Clark,'Kay.
Nellie,What?
Nail stylist 2,Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl.
Nellie,"My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra."
Clark,"Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. Excuse me. Full price. We're not together."
Nellie,"Oh, come on!"
Clark,She's living a lie.
Nellie,"Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship."
Oscar,Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
Nail manager,No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple.
Oscar,We are together. Romantically.
Nail manager,Two men? Doesn't work. No discount.
Darryl,"Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere."
Jim,"Hey, Brian."
Brian,Hey.
Pam,Sorry we're late.
Brian,"Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread."
Pam,"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK."
Jim,What?
Pam,He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
Jim,Oh.
Brian,"It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy."
Brian,"It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available."
Pam,"Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him."
Brian,"That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?"
Pam,Where's Alyssa?
Brian,"Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today."
Pam,Oh.
Brian,"Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up."
Dwight,I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
Dwight,Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
Andy,Hi Dwight.
Dwight,You're back. And you're disgusting.
Phyllis,"Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours."
Andy,"Well, well, well, look who it is."
Phyllis,Andy.
Andy,"I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived."
Erin,Andy!
Andy,Hey! Sweetheart! I have missed you so much.
Erin,"Yes. Welcome back, buddy."
Andy,I have been dreaming of this moment.
Erin,Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
Erin,"I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something."
Oscar,What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
Andy,"Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe."
Dwight,"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour."
Andy,"Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting."
Clark,Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
Dwight,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?"
Andy,"I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe."
Erin,He only emailed me four times.
Andy,Question. Where's Jim?
Phyllis,He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
Andy,For two hours? Really?
Oscar,"So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?"
Andy,If the shoe fits.
Brian,"We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb."
Jim,"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight."
Brian,"Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other."
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,What?
Brian,At least my crying won't get you fired.
Jim,Crying?
Andy,I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
Dwight,Thank you.
Andy,And you sold it to Jan too.
Dwight,Yes!
Andy,I mean... I'm impressed.
Dwight,Yeah!
Andy,"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight."
Dwight,You were on a boat.
Andy,I was...
Dwight,On a boat.
Andy,That...
Dwight,In the ocean.
Andy,OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? Just say the word 'coolio'.
Dwight,I'm not gonna say it.
Andy,Say it.
Dwight,Not a word.
Andy,Coolio.
Dwight,No! What do you think you're doing?
Andy,Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
Dwight,Don't you dare! Andy!
Jan,Hello?
Andy,"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here."
Jan,"Oh, Andy."
Andy,I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
Jan,Really?
Andy,Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
Jan,Hmm.
Dwight,Coolio.
Jan,Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
Dwight,Coolio. Coolio.
Andy,"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood."
Jan,Yeah.
Dwight,Coolio.
Andy,"It, it's, it's actually just an issue..."
Jan,"You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option."
Dwight,"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything."
Andy,"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but..."
Jan,Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
Andy,"Well, ah, ah..."
Dwight,"Please Ja, Ja..."
Andy,Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
Andy,"Hey, everybody, great job. Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks."
Angela,"Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays."
Andy,All right. Thank you very much. Looking good. Who's that little fella?
Angela,It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
Andy,"Wow, that's wonderful!"
Oscar,A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Andy,Uh-huh.
Angela,Uh-huh.
Andy,"Uh-huh... Uh-huh. Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed."
Dwight,Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
Clark,"Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week."
Kevin,"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?"
Dwight,"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months."
Dwight,"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf."
Nellie,"I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?"
Meredith,Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Erin,Hey!
Pete,"Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?"
Erin,"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands."
Dwight,"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway."
Andy,"What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! All right. Back to work."
Pam,"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?"
Jim,"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy."
Pam,I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
Jim,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you."
Pam,It's not Brian's fault.
Jim,"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it."
Pam,OK.
Andy,I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
Dwight,"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages."
Andy,"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?"
David Wallace,Hey guys.
Andy,"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do."
David Wallace,"Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers."
Andy,Thank you.
David Wallace,"Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?"
Andy,Great!
David Wallace,"Great job, everybody!"
Andy,We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
Kevin,"You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank..."
Dwight,... lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
Andy,What?!
Dwight,Yeah.
Andy,There was a fire in the warehouse?
Dwight,The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
Kevin,Whoa.
Andy,"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?"
Phyllis,We started selling balloons.
Andy,What?!
Clark,"Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin."
Andy,No kidding?
Clark,"Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless."
Andy,Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.
Clark,They're tasteful.
Andy,"Good, good. What else?"
Andy,"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire."
David Wallace,What fire?
Andy,The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
David Wallace,It looked fine to me.
Andy,"I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire."
David Wallace,OK.
Andy,I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
David Wallace,"Thanks, Andy."
Andy,Thank you.
David Wallace,All right. Everyone!
Erin,Fish sounds great.
Andy,"Yeah, I guess."
Erin,"Really playing the scales, huh?"
Andy,"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?"
Erin,I don't love you anymore.
Andy,What?
Erin,"I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you."
Andy,"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here."
Erin,I just said there isn't love.
Andy,"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time."
Erin,I guess.
Andy,"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun."
Erin,You got really sunburned.
Andy,"I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years."
Erin,Ugh.
Andy,"I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again."
Erin,You really think we can get that back?
Andy,Yes. Come on. Totally.
Jim,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
Pam,Oh?
Jim,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?"
Pam,Are you sure?
Jim,I just feel like we're gonna fight.
Pam,Yeah.
Jim,So... how 'bout let's not?
Pam,OK.
Jim,"Oh, um. Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it."
David Wallace,"...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!"
Dwight,Yes ma'am.
Jim,And I have started a business in Philadelphia.
Andy,"I resent that. I, I never lied to you."
Angela,Good.
Oscar's Computer,My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment.
David,"Really? ""Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA."""
Mark,"This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?"
Oscar,"You could all be doing this, just saying."
Andy,And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
Toby,Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
Oscar,"I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online."
David,"""By the way, Oscar says 'hi'"""
Nellie,Um.
Stanley,Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
Andy,"Oscar says ""hi"" all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ""Hi"" ""Hello"" ""Hola"" You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ""hi""?"
Toby,Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Oscar,"I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?"
David,Andy.
Nellie,Oh no.
Kevin,"Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?"
Andy,But you're calling me a liar.
Toby,...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Oscar,Can someone please help me?
David,Andy!
Nellie,No no no no.
Phyllis,"Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please?"
Andy,"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately."
Toby,...minor points.
Oscar,"Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads"
David,Watch it Andy!
Nellie,"No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes."
Andy,"Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. ""Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick."" Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!"
Toby,I've been drafting a letter.
David,My wife?
Nellie,For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
Andy,This has been a really tough time.
David,Yeah?
Andy,Yeah.
David,Has it?
Mark,"My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say ""Chillax"" people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me."
Andy,"Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard."
Roger,No. I heard you.
David,Shh.
Mark,"Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers."
Andy,It was like a security blan-
Pam,Oh my god.
David,Andy.
Andy,"Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend."
Andy,#NAME?
Meredith,"Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk...."
David,Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
Andy,Ugh.
Andy,You're not?
Meredith,Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
David,No.
Phyllis,"Come on Andy, they're a good match."
Andy,That's awesome.
Andy,That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
David,I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
Darryl,"Hey, Andy."
Andy,"David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it."
Andy,What?!
David,We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Darryl,You've got a booger bubble going on there.
Andy,Crystal.
Andy,Sorry.
David,"You are on very- Hey, very thin ice."
Darryl,It's ok.
Andy,Vanilla. Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
Andy,My whole life is a booger bubble!
Andy,Good morning.
Mark,This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. From The Smurfs movie.
Erin,Good morning.
Pam,"Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-"
Andy,And how are you on this fine-
Mark,"What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it."
Andy,"Ok, we ready? Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up."
Pam,"Oh, cause it was upside down."
Andy,Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
Mark,You're a good audience.
Pam,He sounds like a wounded animal.
Pam,So um-
Stanley,Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
Mark,Unlike some of these people around here.
Phyllis,"I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad."
Pam,"Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-"
Stanley,I'm the same way with horny people.
Mark,"Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam?"
Pam,Ok.
Pam,Yes.
Erin,Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Mark,"What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan! Pam Halpert is my name, and I've been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute...You have children?"
Pam,"Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you."
Pam,"Two children, yes."
Pam,"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note."
Mark,"You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be."
Dwight,"No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do."
Pete,Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Dwight,I need you.
Andy,Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation
Angela,Ahh! Dwight!
Pete,"Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on."
Dwight,"And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes."
Andy,"Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now."
Angela,What? What is it?
Erin,"Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear."
Dwight,"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs."
Andy,Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
Angela,"Dwight, that's awful."
Pete,"Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now."
Dwight,"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ""poisoned"" by Aunt Shirley."
Erin,See? We can all be friends!
Angela,"What do you mean by ""poisoned""?"
Pete,Yeah.
Dwight,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was."
Erin,"Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward."
Angela,"Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt."
Pete,I do think we can have a fair....
Dwight,Thank you.
Andy,"Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun."
Angela,But I don't see how this is my problem.
Mark,"Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So..."
Dwight,"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-"
Pam,I am not pr-
Angela,Ugh.
Mark,You're not.
Dwight,And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
Pam,"Pregnant, no."
Angela,Gah.
Mark,I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
Dwight,"There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap."
Pam,Wow.
Angela,It's fine.
Mark,"Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-"
Dwight,"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?"
Pam,I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
Angela,"Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-"
Mark,"It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again."
Dwight,It's a divet...
Pam,"So, kinda like a receptionist."
Angela,I'll help you!
Mark,"Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?"
Dwight,"..where it was and it needs, it needs a..."
Pam,Yes.
Angela,Ugh.
Mark,"Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted."
Andy,Where are you going?
Pam,"I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't."
Pam,"Uh, not on a three month boat trip."
Shirley,Ow! The braid is too tight.
Andy,"Wha? Oh, burn. Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?"
Angela,Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
Dwight,How dare you?
Shirley,Yes ma'am.
Andy,I'm still the boss!
Angela,"I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way."
Erin,I...
Shirley,Ok.
Andy,The answer is yes.
Angela,There.
Erin,..just have some messages for you.
Shirley,Thank you Angela.
Andy,Are they from you?
Toby,I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
Erin,"Well no, they're from clients."
Nellie,Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Andy,"Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it."
Darryl,Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Erin,I can't. I-
Toby,Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it.
Andy,"Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing."
Nellie,He's doing it.
Erin,These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Pam,hey!
Andy,I don't want to talk about work right now.
Jim,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
Erin,Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Pam,"Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-"
Andy,Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Jim,"I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in."
Erin,"Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army."
Pam,Eight? Really?
Pete,I've got the seat adjusted right.
Jim,"I'll make it worth your while, I promise."
Clark,"Perfect height, yeah."
Pam,"Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight."
Andy,She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
Jim,"Alright, love you."
Pete,I was just leaving.
Pam,Love you.
Andy,"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch"
Alice,Hi.
Pete,I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Erin,Hi.
Andy,Survey says
Alice,I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
Clark,"Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now."
Erin,Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Andy,Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
Alice,"Ok, great. Thanks."
Clark,"There you go, good for you."
Meredith,Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
Andy,No.
Erin,"Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way."
Clark,"You just let it all hang out, that's what..."
Alice,Nice to meet you. Cute sweater.
Andy,"May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you."
Erin,"Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk."
Clark,I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
Kevin,I'm Kevin.
Dwight,"Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight."
Alice,Pete?
Shirley,"Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight."
Pete,Alice. Oh man.
Angela,Hello Aunt Shirley.
Alice,"It's uh, been a while, huh?"
Shirley,Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch.
Erin,"What, do you two know each other?"
Dwight,"This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!"
Pete,"Yeah. We uh, have a history."
Shirley,New clothes? What for?
Erin,Oh.
Dwight,OK
Alice,"History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years."
Angela,"Oh, God."
Erin,That's so random.
Dwight,"You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit."
Pete,Well. Is it?
Angela,Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Erin,Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.
Shirley,How would you like a mean cold slap?
Creed,"Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man."
Angela,Ow!
Gabe,Hello beautiful.
Dwight,"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?"
Kevin,Didn't you two used to do it?
Shirley,I could do that.
Gabe,We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Dwight,Ok.
Creed,She's looking good.
Angela,No. No.
Toby,"Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb."
Dwight,"Yeah, trust me."
Toby,"This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? I think this is a start of my first friendship."
Angela,No.
Clark,So Pete was a librarian?
Dwight,"It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find."
Alice,He worked as a librarian freshman year.
Shirley,Step on it!
Clark,Was he like the sexy librarian?
Andy,"Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places."
Pete,Ok.
Phyllis,"Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping."
Alice,Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.
Andy,"I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen."
Andy,Hi.
Oscar,You're clearly snooping.
Alice,Hi.
Creed,"That's kinda uncool, man."
Andy,"Hi, how's it going?"
Meredith,"Ah, come on."
Alice,Hi. Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-
Phyllis,Andy!
Andy,Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
Oscar,That's her private property.
Pete,"Andy, that is really inappropriate."
Meredith,Tell us!
Andy,Awkward.
Andy,"Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?"
Pete,It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Phyllis,What does that even mean?
Andy,Really uncomfortable situation.
Meredith,What's it say?
Pete,Yeah.
Phyllis,Put it down.
Andy,"It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ""move on"". Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm."
Andy,"Everyone please, just-"
Alice,So there's no marketing department.
Creed,It's not cool.
Clark,No.
Phyllis,Put it down
Pete,No.
Oscar,Andy. That is her private property.
Gabe,"You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin."
Meredith,Boo.
Erin,So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Andy,Oh my god.
Gabe,Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
Stanley,Uh huh.
Erin,Yeah.
Phyllis,See?
Gabe,You must be pretty horny.
Stanley,That's where nosey'll get you.
Nellie,"well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? One week? Ok, two weeks? Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave."
Phyllis,Told you so.
Shirley,I feel like a show pony.
Andy,"Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone."
Dwight,And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Darryl,"Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated."
Angela,You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
Andy,Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
Dwight,By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Kevin,Pete...
Angela,Mmhm.
Clark,Hmm.
Dwight,Would you like the stink sack?
Kevin,Pete what?
Angela,Is it any good?
Pete,"It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete."
Dwight,"No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack."
Pam,hello!
Angela,Thank you.
Jim,Hey! There she is. How you doin?
Shirley,"So, when's the wedding?"
Pam,"Hi! Hey, do I look ok?"
Angela,"Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends."
Jim,You look great.
Shirley,That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
Pam,Ok
Pam,Hello?
Jim,Yeah.
Jim,Hey! Back here.
Pam,What's that? Is that a-
Pam,"Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?"
Jim,"Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands."
Jim,"Si, senor."
Isaac,"Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door."
Pam,"Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job."
Pam,"How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear."
Jim,Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Isaac,It's a phone?
Pam,"Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate."
Pam,"Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it."
Jim,Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Isaac,"Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam."
Pam,You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
Pam,Thanks.
Jim,"Alright. So, tell me all about it."
Jim,"You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you."
Dwight,"Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you."
Pam,"Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me."
Angela,"It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. Dwight, Dwight."
Jim,Call you right back. What were you saying?
Dwight,"Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse."
Pam,Ha ha.
Angela,"No, Dwight. The Senator."
Athlead Coworker,"Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line."
Dwight,"Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey."
Jim,"I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck!"
Angela,"I can't be your monkey, Dwight."
Pam,Bye.
Dwight,I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Angela,"Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly."
Angela,I made a vow. I gave my word.
Dwight,"In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night."
Dwight,Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Shirley,
Angela,"Good night, D."
Dwight,"Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down."
Erin,How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Angela,Spray her down?
Pete,It is so unpleasant. You?
Dwight,"No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic."
Andy,"Hey, love turds. Conference room, now."
Pete,Hey.
Andy,Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
Andy,"Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?"
Gabe,"Honestly, it was a little weird."
Pete,Yeah. You were gone.
Andy,"Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?"
Andy,I knew it!
Gabe,I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
Pete,"For a long time, Andy."
Erin,Gabe!
Andy,You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
Gabe,...a lot of the time.
Pete,"Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap."
Andy,"And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch."
Andy,No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
Pete,"Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy."
Pete,What?
Alice,"Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem."
Andy,"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. So you had a bad day-"
Pete,It was college. That is what you do.
Pete,Andy?
Alice,"Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that."
Andy,..The camera don't lie!
Erin,"Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?"
Pete,Andy.
Andy,"We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?"
Andy,You're being an idiot get..
Gabe,Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
Pete,I'm trying..
Erin,"Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican."
Andy,"Out of my office, turns out you're fired..."
Gabe,I got a tattoo for you.
Pete,Andy.
Erin,I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Andy,Because you suck.
Gabe,Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Pete,You can't fire-
Alice,"So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete."
Andy,And you're fired...
Pete,She's nice to me.
Pete,If you want to talk to me
Alice,How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
Andy,So you had a bad day...
Erin,"Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-"
Pete,I'll be in the annex.
Gabe,I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
Andy,Rut ti doh doh...
Pete,Oh my god.
Pete,Alright? I'll be in the annex.
Gabe,"What kind of music are you into, Peter?"
Andy,Rut tit doh doh...
Pete,"Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe."
Pete,Toby!
Gabe,Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
Andy,Rut ti doh doo doh
Pete,No!
Pete,Toby?
Gabe,"Erin, are you even hearing this?"
Toby,"You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?"
Erin,He didn't even say that.
Andy,No.
Alice,"He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else?"
Toby,"Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges."
Gabe,"Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night."
Andy,Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Erin,"Gabe, I don't-"
Toby,"Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin."
Gabe,Give me one night with you...
Andy,"They already have a contract? ""Mutually agree to-"" Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch."
Erin,What is that supposed to mean?
Toby,"It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it."
Gabe,I have shaved everything...
Andy,"Well, I'm not signing away my rights."
Erin,I don't want you to shave everything.
Toby,I already signed it. I was just showing you.
Alice,"I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!"
Andy,"Ok, well we'll see about that."
Pete,I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man.
Toby,"Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. It's the original."
Gabe,I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
Mark,"... talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something."
Pete,Why don't you say in the beginning
Pam,Hello.
Gabe,Shove his sashimi!
Mark,"Hi, I'm Mark."
Erin,What do you-!
Pam,"Hi, Pam, hello."
Alice,Because I had to wait-
Mark,"I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D'Jango! I don't agree with the use of the ""N"" word in that movie. It's, it's too soon."
Andy,"Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? Yeah. Yeah, it does."
Pam,I'm Pam Halpert.
Pam,"So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura."
Mark,"Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style. He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it?"
Jim,Tell me about the cologne. How much?
Pam,Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
Pam,"Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least."
Shirley,Time to get clean!
Jim,You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
Dwight,"It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose."
Pam,Guess what poster he had on his wall?
Angela,You have to use chains?
Jim,Austin Powers.
Dwight,You'll see. Here we go.
Pam,MmMm.
Shirley,Let's get this show on the road.
Jim,Ferris Bueller.
Dwight,Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Pam,MmMm. You're getting colder.
Angela,Dwight!
Jim,Not Night at the Roxbury.
Dwight,Let's get to it.
Pam,No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Angela,No! No!
Jim,"I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?"
Dwight,Give it a whirl.
Pam,"I don't know, but it's interesting right?"
Angela,"Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal."
Jim,It's fascinating.
Shirley,Stop your belly-aching and hose me.
Pam,He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Dwight,I need you to hose my aunt.
Jim,"That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?"
Angela,No Dwight!
Pam,Mmhm.
Dwight,OK you are useless.
Jim,"So, next interview has to be better."
Angela,"No, Dwight!"
Pam,I don't know.
Dwight,Give me the hose!
Jim,What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Angela,"No Dwight, I won't-"
Pam,"I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this."
Dwight,Ahh! OK!
Jim,Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Angela,I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Pam,"Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton."
Dwight,Hold it!
Creed,New glasses.
Erin,"Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are."
Dwight,I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Pam,"Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?"
Dwight,"I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother."
Dwight,My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
Jim,My condolences.
Dwight,Keep them.
Jim,"OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?"
Dwight,"In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil."
Erin,What color is it?
Phyllis,It looks pretty black.
Kevin,"Yep. Acidic, all right."
Oscar,"Oh, thank god."
Dwight,Excuse me?
Oscar,"I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session..."
Dwight,OK. That's not...
Oscar,I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
Jim,I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Dwight,I really hope so.
Jim,OK. This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Dwight,I miss her so much.
Jim,OK.
Dwight,You know?
Mose,Zeke's here.
Dwight,Zeke.
Zeke,"Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'."
Mose,'Hi' to Mom.
Dwight,Are you going?
Mose,Will there be ghosts there?
Dwight,Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Zeke,You get in the sidecar.
Dwight,Get...
Dwight,What are you doing here?
Oscar,You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
Dwight,"Oh, yeah."
Oscar,Who is that?
Dwight,"Jeb, my brother."
Oscar,You have a brother?
Dwight,Uh-huh.
Jeb,I didn't really see a better parking spot. Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. You wanna go in?
Erin,"Oh, gosh."
Todd Packer,"Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours."
Clark,Who's this guy?
Pam,... bad.
Todd Packer,"Hi, all."
Phyllis,"Why are you here, Todd?"
Todd Packer,"OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did."
Kevin,"Packer, we accept."
Todd Packer,"Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff. OK. Uh, where to begin. Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, this kid in a few years."
Pam,"Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology."
Todd Packer,"Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'."
Pam,I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
Todd Packer,"Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? There you go."
Pam,"Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake."
German Minister,We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil.
Jeb,Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.
Dwight,Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
Jeb,"Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all."
Dwight,"Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies."
Jeb,It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.
Dwight,"Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies."
Jeb,Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any.
German Minister,Would the family care to say something?
Dwight,You had black hair and then gray hair.
Zeke,"You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4"", at the end you were 5'1""."
Oscar,They're a descriptive people.
Fannie,I see you started without me.
Dwight,"You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?"
Fannie,"Well, I told you..."
Jeb,"Hi, Fannie.
Fannie"
Oscar,Who is that?
Zeke,Dwight's sister.
Oscar,Dwight has a sister?
Zeke,Yeah.
Oscar,She's beautiful.
Zeke,Blugh.
Dwight,"Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. What is this? Oh, god. Henry."
Henry,Dwight.
Dwight,I see Esther's back in town.
Esther,Hi Dwight.
Dwight,Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
Esther,This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
Dwight,"Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens."
Fannie,We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.
Dwight,OK.
Henry,Anyone mention her height?
Zeke,Yep.
Henry,"Land size? Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. OK."
Dwight,"So, let's get it going."
German Minister,Would you want to do the honors?
Fannie,"Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this."
Dwight,"We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness."
Oscar,That's it for me.
Pam,I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
Phyllis,"I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy."
Pam,"We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?"
Creed,"$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen."
Creed,"I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant."
Clark,"Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark."
Todd Packer,"Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier."
Clark,You didn't actually say that.
Todd Packer,No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. Hey. I have a crazy feeling that you are really gonna like this.
Stanley,"Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. And you did fire him."
Nellie,"I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong."
Pam,Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
Angela,Do they even have a bakery anymore?
Kevin,"They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day."
Pam,"So, it really is just about the cupcakes."
Andy,"Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes."
Phyllis,"So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?"
Meredith,OK.
Phyllis,OK. Packer can go to hell.
Aunt Shirley,"Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city."
Dwight,Thank you.
Aunt Shirley,Jeb. A street pusher.
Jeb,"After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out ""worm"" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management."
Dwight,"I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich."
Aunt Shirley,"We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it."
Fannie,Is she crazy? Dwight?
Jeb,Buddy? Buddy?
Fannie,"No, no, no."
Jeb,Snap out of it. Dwight?
Dwight,Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Fannie,"No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?"
Dwight,Of course you are.
Fannie,"Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication."
Dwight,Oh my god.
Fannie,"That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just... it's almost like there's a... a willing ignorance."
Fannie,"Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just... maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute."
Jeb,Totally. Yep. The people here are like Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?
Dwight,You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Jeb,Couple of nights couldn't hurt.
Fannie,"Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt."
Dwight,"You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes."
Zeke,Absolutely.
Zeke,"Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian."
Fannie,That doesn't work on me.
Dwight,OK.
Fannie,"By the way, that's not..."
Dwight,
Fannie,"Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui."
Dwight,Oui.
Fannie,Oh my goodness.
Dwight,"People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck."
Fannie,"So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks."
Todd Packer,"Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you."
Meredith,I'm not sorry about it.
Todd Packer,I am. It was my rock bottom.
Angela,"Kevin, you can do this."
Kevin,You don't know that.
Pam,"Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?"
Angela,Uh-huh.
Kevin,James Bond was a spy.
Pam,Yes. He was a good spy.
Kevin,Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Todd Packer,"Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care."
Todd Packer,"I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it."
Pam,"Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. Hey!"
Angela,"What, Pam?"
Pam,Wait!
Angela,He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
Pam,"No, no. It's the principle of the thing."
Andy,"Oh my god. I forgive him so much. Whoa, is he choking?"
Angela,Kevin?
Kevin,"Oh, that was fantastic."
Cameron,Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?
Dwight,"Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens."
Cameron,I was just asking you something I didn't know.
Dwight,"Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit."
Cameron,Are we gonna eat these today?
Dwight,If you want.
Cameron,Is that a guillotine?
Dwight,"This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking."
Cameron,That's a cow?
Dwight,Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
Cameron,What are you doing now?
Dwight,Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Cameron,I don't know.
Dwight,"Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?"
Cameron,I don't know any of that.
Dwight,"OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?"
Cameron,I never met him.
Pam,"Good morning, Erin."
Erin,Hey.
Pam,"Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK."
Phyllis,"I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise."
Pam,Phyllis!
Clark,Packer laced the cupcakes.
Pam,No!
Meredith,Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Angela,Some of us got both.
Pam,Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
Phyllis,"Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars."
Nellie,"Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet."
Stanley,Me too.
Clark,"I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night."
Phyllis,"What did you do, Andy?"
Andy,"Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. Na, nothing really. Kevin?"
Kevin,Why would you ask me?
Andy,"I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. Pretty normal night."
Kevin,My night was just like that. Meaning normal.
Andy,Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all.
Kevin,Nope. I did not see you either.
Pam,Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
Kevin,Ah.
Pam,"But, Kevin that's..."
Kevin,"Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand."
Angela,No.
Todd Packer,"So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends."
Darryl,"That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage."
Jim,"Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too."
Todd Packer,It's OK. I'm over it.
Jeb,Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it.
Fannie,Not it.
Dwight,"It. That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that."
Fannie,All right.
Kevin,Uh oh. She's doing it again.
Pam,No I think you explained it.
Pam,"Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um..."
Brian,"Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- Pam."
Clark,It's p0rn.
Jim,"""Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh."""
Pam,Yeah.
Ryan Howard,That'll pay for the exploding helicopter.
Dwight,"Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment."
Jim,Smart.
Phyllis,Why?
Ryan Howard,"""Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium. The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs."""
Darryl,"Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public."
Jim,"""Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks."""
Pam,"Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit."
Ryan Howard,"Come on man, sell it!"
Meredith,Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Darryl,"Yeah, Jim."
Group,Ugh. Ew.
Jim,"""Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!"""
Andy,What?
Ryan Howard,"Yeah, that's better. A bunch of hot women go"
Dwight,Phyllis is m*st*rb*t*ng. In the office right now as we speak.
Jim,"""Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you."""
Angela,Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Ryan Howard,"""They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story."""
Toby,He- he can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
Jim,"Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends."
Group,No!
Darryl,It's so strong.
Oscar,"Toby, how do you propose that we-"
Ryan Howard,Keep reading then.
Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?"
Jim,"""Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack."""
Pam,She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
Ryan Howard,Um another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader.
Andy,Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
Jim,I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Dwight,"OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this."
Darryl,We can look into it.
Phyllis,What the hell?!
Jim,We'll look into it.
Dwight,"It's OK guys, she's no longer horny."
Ryan Howard,We need Darth.
Andy,"Excuse me, dirty birdie"
Jim,We gotta get him.
Phyllis,"Wait, what?"
Darryl,We'll go after Darth then.
Andy,You can have this back at the end of the day. Oh!!
Jim,We're gonna go get him.
Dwight,"Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles."
Darryl,That's what we gotta do.
Clark,What's her name?
Jim,We're gonna get him.
Dwight,Esther Ruger.
Dwight,Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
Clark,Sweet.
Clark,"A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours."
Dwight,Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
Dwight,Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Clark,Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
Clark,"Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way."
Dwight,"Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me."
Dwight,By hand.
Clark,Oh.
Esther,"Dwight, we need to talk."
Dwight,What do you think?
Dwight,"I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther."
Clark,The same thing that you think.
Esther,"Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends."
Dwight,A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
Dwight,No.
Clark,"God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air."
Esther,"So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back."
Angela,"Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes."
Dwight,That snake!
Angela,Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart!
Esther,You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine.
Pam,Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
Dwight,That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
Jim,Oh man.
Esther,Mmhm.
Pam,I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
Dwight,"So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?"
Jim,"Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen."
Esther,"Of course. You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you?"
Pam,Um.
Dwight,No!
Jim,What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Clark,"Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?"
Pam,You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
Dwight,Post hole digging.
Jim,"Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman."
Esther,Stupid.
Pam,"Oh, oh OK."
Senator,"You've reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message."
Jim,"Yeah, yeah. Exactly."
Angela & Oscar,Hi honey!
Pam,"Um, Ok. Well?"
Oscar,Oh you?
Jim,"Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?"
Angela,No you go. Hi honey!
Pam,"Yeah, sounds good. Ok."
Oscar,"Hey, Hey Robert!"
Jim,Ok great.
Angela,It's Angela and Oscar.
Pam,Ok.
Oscar,Hey.
Jim,Bye.
Angela,Just a few quick things.
Pam,Bye.
Oscar,"Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos."
Kevin,"What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?"
Angela,Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Oscar,There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Oscar,Very much so.
Phyllis,Play it again.
Angela,Yeah.
Promo Voice,The boss. The workers. The lives. The loves. The people. The paper. The Office
Oscar,Absolutely.
Kevin,Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
Angela,Yeah!
Kevin,"This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo."
Oscar,"Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay."
Kevin,Did you see this?
Angela,"Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it."
Angela,Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
Oscar,I think that's it!
Clark,"Oh my god, is that you and Jim?"
Angela,I think we're good.
Pam,Uh huh.
Oscar,Done!
Clark,"Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? Yikes. That is awful."
Angela,Bye!
Pam,It wasn't so bad.
Oscar,Ok!
Andy,"Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ""Banjo at 0"
Angela,Love you! God.
Jim,"Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert."
Andy,Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out.
Ryan Howard,Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.
Nellie,Good night Andy.
Darryl,"Hey, man. Darryl."
Andy,"Huh? Yeah, see ya. Oh! What?!"
Ryan Howard,"Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. Eat Fresh."
Promo Announcer,
Jim,Let's go to the conference room.
Pam,I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that.
Dwight,"Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots."
Angela,I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Dwight,Did I tell you about her teeth?
Erin,"Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper."
Angela,Yes.
Dwight,"Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome."
Mr. Ruger,Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.
Dwight,"Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always."
Esther,Thank you.
Angela,"I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing."
Pam,Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
Stanley,We've all changed.
Jim,"With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number."
Darryl,"And we all know, baseball does not last forever."
Ryan Howard,I look at these actors on TV and I think
Jim,Right?
Ryan Howard,Watch this
Darryl,Subway sandwiches.
Jim,Yep.
Ryan Howard,How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext.
Jim,Wow.
Ryan Howard,"I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called ""The Big Piece"""
Jim,"Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical."
Ryan Howard,"Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard-"
Jim,OK
Ryan Howard,#NAME?
Darryl,The space dust does it.
Jim,Space dust.
Darryl,Yeah.
Ryan Howard,I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together.
Jim,"Sure, yeah. Hollywood. Alright."
Darryl,"Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it."
Jim,"Ok, great."
Kevin,"Andy, are there documentary groupies?"
Andy,Of course there are!
Kevin,Of course.
Toby,"A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-"
Nellie,"Oh, I don't care."
Oscar,"Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark."
Pam,Oh my god!
Promo Announcer,
Kevin,"What was that word they said when they showed me ""Skrald mand""? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy?"
Oscar,Dumpster Man.
Kevin,Cool. Superhero.
Angela,"What about me? ""Klokken tre pige"""
Oscar,"""Three PM Girl"""
Angela,"What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!"
Oscar,It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Phyllis,Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Angela,Oh my god.
Angela,"There was much more secret filming than I expected. But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am."
Oscar,Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Meredith,I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? Boob sauce!
Group,No!
Oscar,Meredith!
Angela,Come on!
Nellie,Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
Oscar,"Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!"
Erin,Hey.
Angela,Oscar.
Oscar,I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Oscar,"I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you?"
Andy,"People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says"
Angela,I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
Stanley,"Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea."
Oscar,"Ok everyone, turn off your mikes."
Angela,We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
Erin,I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?
Nellie,My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
Pete,"Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got."
Pam,Brian?
Pete,Yeah.
Pam,"Yeah, I guess I could."
Stanley,"Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me."
Phyllis,I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
Stanley,She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Group,Oh!
Meredith,Wow.
Clark,"Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?"
Ruger Sister 1,That manipulates the secondary shaft.
Clark,"Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga!"
Salesmen,The lift capacity's up at two thousand pounds. That's a lot of beets.
Mr. Ruger,"Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns."
Dwight,"Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal."
Mr. Ruger,"Esther, get in the truck."
Dwight,"Ok ok ok, wait! You win."
Salesman,Let's get the paperwork started.
Ruger Sister 2,We should buy an auger together.
Clark,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
Ruger Sister 1,You would be a great one to buy an auger with.
Stanley,"Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring."
Andy,"Oh! Seven new comments. ""The guy at 0"
Dwight,Security deposit. That's been-
Mr. Ruger,Standard.
Dwight,"Right, standard."
Clark,"Hey, can I talk to you for one second?"
Dwight,No.
Clark,One second.
Dwight,No.
Clark,One second.
Dwight,I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Clark,Don't do it.
Dwight,"What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off."
Clark,"Dude, we're being conned."
Dwight,Go on.
Clark,These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Dwight,No.
Clark,Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
Dwight,What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
Clark,I don't even know what an auger is!
Dwight,No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Mr. Ruger,"Hey, you ready to sign?"
Dwight,I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.
Brian,"Oh, hey!"
Pam,Hey!
Brian,Hi.
Pam,"Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?"
Brian,"No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-"
Pam,"Oh my gosh, please, don't."
Brian,"Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there."
Pam,"Sure, yeah. Yeah."
Brian,Let me grab a couple drinks.
Pam,"OK. Oh wow, you have a nice view."
Brian,"Alright, that's for you."
Pam,"Oh, thank you."
Brian,Cheers.
Pam,Cheers.
Angela,"Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?"
Oscar,They caught us kissing on Halloween.
Angela,Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!
Oscar,Oh!
Angela,God!
Oscar,Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Angela,Oh! Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Oscar,"Well, I don't like giving him bad news."
Angela,Call him!
Oscar,You call him!
Angela,Call him!
Oscar,Stop hitting me!
Angela,Call him! Call him!
Oscar,No!
Brian,So...
Pam,So..
Brian,What brings you by?
Pam,"Well, the promo for the documentary aired today."
Brian,"Oh yeah, that's right."
Pam,Yeah. It's kinda crazy.
Brian,"Yeah, it is."
Pam,"See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?"
Brian,"Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment."
Pam,"Yeah, wasn't that neat?"
Brian,"Yeah, it was cool."
Pam,"Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?"
Brian,Um...
Pam,I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
Brian,"No no, it's-"
Pam,"I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?"
Brian,"No, you're not crazy."
Pam,"Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-"
Brian,Yeah.
Pam,"You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much."
Brian,They want to know how much what?
Pam,How much stuff you got.
Brian,Pretty much everything.
Pam,"Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?"
Brian,"They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you."
Pam,So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Brian,"That's not really true, I mean-"
Pam,"Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go."
Brian,"Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better."
Stanley,What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
Stanley,A beautiful family.
Erin,Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! Come on Stanley!
Dwight,Right? Come on!             
Erin,"Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a... ""Mageddon!"""
Dwight,"Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis."
Erin,"Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!"
Carla,"So, what can you do?"
Stanley,"I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they're making me climb Stair Mountain!"
Andy,"Well, what can't I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent."
Erin,Come on!
Carla,Can you drive a car?
Oscar,Our office has an unusually large number of... unusually large people.
Andy,"At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here."
Stanley,This is an abomination.
Carla,"Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?"
Erin,Come on. You got this. Here.
Andy,"My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal's going out on."
Oscar,"So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time."
Carla,"Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?"
Andy,"Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in."
Andy,
Oscar,What?
Carla,"Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid's party, let â€˜em throw pies at ya?"
Andy,I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There's a review of the documentary!
Andy,"Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. I'm all for it."
Phyllis,What does it say?
Carla,"Well, Mr. Bernard, I'm gonna be honest with you."
Andy,"I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ""Red Alert."""
Andy,"Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much."
Dwight,"Well, the alert was already set to ""Red"" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ""Double Red""?"
Carla,"Uh, no. We'reâ€”we're gonna take you on as a client."
Andy,I think we should.
Andy,"You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me."
Stanley,
Carla,"We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out."
Oscar,"""The Office"
Andy,"Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots."
Everyone,Whoo!
Todd,"Uh, it doesn't include headshots."
Nellie,"""In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There's Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get."""
Andy,It doesn't include headshots.
Dwight,What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news...thing.
Todd,No.
Nellie,"""Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy."""
Andy,"Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though."
Phyllis,"Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that's-."
Stanley,"So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?"
Andy,It's okay. The hell does he know?
Dwight,"You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. Silly me. Gotta take the stairs."
Nellie,"""A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent."""
Stanley,"Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up."
Andy,I want you to print that out for me.
Dwight,"Wellâ€”no, noâ€”nâ€”"
Nellie,I will.
Stanley,
Andy,"Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb."
Dwight,We need a winch and a hoist.
Erin,"""Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values."""
Nellie,Oh! Which public figure?
Erin,I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years.
Phyllis,"No, I think they mean more like a politician."
Stanley,You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Dwight,"Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go."
Stanley,"Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator."
Dwight,"The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order."
Stanley,"You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams."
Pete,Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
Pam,"Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks."
Nellie,"Oh, your mom's watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor."
Pam,I wish.
Nellie,"What, then?"
Pam,"Oh, nothing that exciting."
Nellie,Marriage counseling?
Pam,Hmm.
Nellie,Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Pam,"You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help."
Nellie,Mmm.
Pam,"I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right?"
Jim,"Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question."
Toby,"Oh, sure."
Jim,"It's a little, uh, personal."
Toby,Let's do it. Let's get personal.
Jim,I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Toby,Whoa.
Jim,"Sorry. Iâ€”no, no, no, what I meantâ€”what I meant actually wasâ€”"
Toby,"Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so..."
Jim,You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Toby,
Jim,Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling.
Toby,"Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren't in couple's counseling, are you? Oh, God."
Jim,"No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better."
Toby,"Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So sâ€”hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here."
Clark,My mistake.
Toby,"Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna kill him. How can I help? I'm here."
Jim,That's all right.
Andy,"Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye."
Angela,"Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls."
Robert,Don't worry. I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
Angela,"All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that."
Dwight,Andyâ€” I need to talk to you.
Andy,"Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!"
Dwight,Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Andy,I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final.
Dwight,"So what I'm hearing you say is, ""Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible""?"
Andy,"Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent."
Dwight,Mm-hmm. Good luck.
Andy,Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
Dwight,"For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts."
Clark,"Hey, Dwight."
Dwight,"Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale."
Stanley,Pass.
Clark,"Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?"
Dwight,"Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker."
Stanley,"Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you haâ€”"
Dwight,
Clark,Holy.
Stanley,"No, you didn't. Sick of you and yourâ€”oohâ€”"
Dwight,
Stanley,
Dwight,It's all right. Andy approved it.
Meredith,"Man, he's really in twinkle town now."
Clark,"Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?"
Dwight,"Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do."
Clark,You gave him three shots.
Dwight,Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. Let's go!
Clark,All right.
Dwight,"Move it! One, two, three."
Dwight,"He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain."
Clark,We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
Dwight,Yes.
Dwight,"Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!"
Clark,I am!
Clark,Any good weekend plans?
Dwight,I might see a movie.
Clark,Nice.
Dwight,What about you?
Clark,"Uh, I don't know yet."
Dwight,Let's take himâ€”
Clark,I was thinking about...
Dwight,"Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?"
Clark,And then what?
Dwight,"Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before."
Clark,"Well, if I may, you're a natural."
Dwight,"Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh..."
Clark,That's a little weird.
Dwight,I know. Evel Knievel.
Dwight,
Clark,That's about as good as that's gonna be.
Dwight,"Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him."
Clark,Catch?
Dwight,Yeah.
Clark,"I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds."
Dwight,"You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's onlyâ€”"
Clark,Blunt?
Dwight,"It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicineâ€”"
Clark,"Dude, this size of my haunchesâ€”"
Dwight,Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Clark,"We should probably call a doctor or something, dude."
Dwight,You okay?
Jim,"So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or..."
Toby,You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
Jim,Mm-hmm.
Toby,"He might start by asking each of you, ""Why do you think you're here?"""
Pam,"He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that."
Jim,"If I didn't do certain things without telling Pam, she'd be married to Roy."
Pam,"I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up."
Jim,"If she can just hang on for a little while longer, Iâ€”this will be so huge for our family."
Toby,"Well, what's a little while?"
Jim,What do you mean?
Toby,"I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end."
Jim,That's kind of an impossible question.
Erin,"Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry!"
Kevin,"Ooh, there's Angela! I work with her!"
Andy,"Huh, yeah. I mean, I'm happy Angela's the first one getting famous, but it's a little weird, no? I mean, she can't sing or act, so it's actually kind of insane, if you think about it."
Phyllis,Her hair looks beautiful.
Andy,"Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star!"
Erin,Andy!
Robert,I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest... I am gay.
Crowd,
Reporter #1,"Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay?"
Reporter #2,Question for the Senator's beard.
Robert,I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
Pete,Poor Angela.
Phyllis,Yeah. Poor Angela.
Robert,I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn't until my marriage to Angela that I realized how...charmless I find the female body.
Meredith,Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
Robert,There's someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
Andy,Come on!
Robert,Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first timeâ€”
Erin,Oscar is with the Senator too?
Kevin,"Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew!"
Oscar,He knew!
Kevin,"Yes, we did it!"
Oscar,"You did it, Kevin."
Kevin,"Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it."
Robert,#NAME?
Oscar,What?!
Creed,Wesley Silver's gay?
Crowd,
Angela,
Kevin,Ohh.
Creed,They make a nice couple.
Angela,
Dwight,Almost there. Almost there. Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
Clark,We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Dwight,Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Clark,That's actually really smart.
Dwight,Thank you.
Clark,"God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge."
Dwight,Let's get him inside.
Andy,"Carla Fern is not just an actor's agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate."
Andy,Actor?
Man,"Oh, no. Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse."
Andy,"Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?"
Man,"Eh, you go through a lot of mice."
Man,"If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second."
Andy,Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Man,Yeah. Little hat.
Andy,"Aw, that's cute."
Man,Yeah.
Andy,What's the mouse's name?
Man,"Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys , are you? Oh, great."
Clark,"Hey, wait, wait, howâ€”how are we doing this?"
Dwight,"Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters."
Clark,"Just say ""arms"" and ""legs,"" okay? That justâ€”that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with."
Dwight,"Fine, let's go."
Clark,
Dwight,Hoist his shank on three.
Clark,Whaâ€”What's a shank?
Dwight,It's by the tenderloin.
Dwight,"Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can youâ€”sl-slouch him into the seat. Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt."
Clark,All right.
Dwight,Got it?
Clark,Yeahâ€”yup yup.
Dwight,Get in the back.
Clark,What?
Dwight,Get in the back.
Clark,"Aw, come on."
Dwight,Get in.
Clark,Damn it.
Dwight,"Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?"
Stanley,Helllloooo!
Clark,"Okay. We, heyâ€”hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?"
Stanley,Pigeons.
Dwight,"Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson."
Clark,"Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister?"
Dwight,"New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go."
Pam,"I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly."
Jim,"Well, if Pam says she won't go, thenâ€” we're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph."
Nellie,That was exhausting.
Toby,Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
Nellie,"Well, they deserve each other, then."
Toby,They do. That they do.
Nellie,That is for sure.
Toby,That they do.
Dwight,"And forâ€”oh, whoopsie daisy."
Mrs. Davis,"Stanley, what is going on here?"
Dwight,He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
Clark,Driving.
Dwight,"It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?"
Stanley,"Ooh-hoo, look at that baby..."
Dwight,Stanley.
Stanley,Ohhh...
Mrs. Davis,That's Benji in the middle.
Stanley,"That's Benji. Oh, he's precious. That's a healthy-looking baby."
Mrs. Davis,Very special little boy.
Dwight,Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child.
Mrs. Davis,"Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, ""eee."""
Dwight,Like this? Watch.
Stanley,Eee.
Everyone,
Mrs. Davis,Like that.
Erin,"Oh. Hey, champions."
Toby,Good morning.
Clark,Quater finals in an hour. Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
Erin,I did. I got some really good sleep.
Clark,Did you?
Erin,Bzzz.
Dwight,"Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. Practically made of plastic."
Nellie,"We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill, others relied on showmanship others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster."
Toby,"Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep."
Toby,Ow! Ow!
Pam,"I didn't see you! You should have yelled ""Crossing!"""
Toby,I'm sorry!
Pam,"Ok, so is that my spot?"
Nellie,"We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby."
Andy,"Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!"
Darryl,It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Andy,Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
Andy,"Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two."
Toby,Andy?
Andy,"Go away, we're running lines."
Toby,You wanted to see the gooey eye.
Andy,"Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go."
Toby,"Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later."
Andy,"Yeah, Ok. Alright. Where were we?"
Darryl,Something full of acid.
Andy,And remember
Darryl,"That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here."
Andy,W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Jim,Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Pam,Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
Pam,"So, we had couple's therapy."
Jim,No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Pam,And we have homework.
Jim,"Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly."
Pam,And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
Jim,Mmhm.
Pam,"Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy."
Jim,"Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ""opportunities."""
Andy,"Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig."
Pam,Hey!
Andy,Yeah.
Stanley,Who's Carla Fern?
Andy,"Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator."
Oscar,Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Andy,Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
Oscar,But you just!
Andy,Not cool.
Nellie,"Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds."
Robert,"Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?"
Dwight,I'm pumped!
Erin,Clark's a dead man.
Robert,Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this.
Angela,Oh my god!
Group,Whoa.
Angela,Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Nellie,"Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget."
Stanley,Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Nellie,I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
Erin,"Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously."
Nellie,Oh please.
Angela,"Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens."
Phillip,
Angela,"Come here, come here. Let's go."
Angela,"I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer."
Dwight,"I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent."
Clark,"Oh, wide wings, interesting."
Erin,Hey. Why don't you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Erin,"Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix."
Carla Fern,Are you in that paper documentary too?
Darryl,Yep.
Carla Fern,Do you need an agent?
Andy,"No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage."
Darryl,I was in The Whiz in high school.
Andy,"That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ""action."""
Carla Fern,"Hey, I made them get you a chair. All my clients sit."
Woman,Can I take your picture?
Andy,"I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-"
Woman,We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.
Andy,Got it.
Woman,"No, if you could just keep it down until.."
Andy,Sorry.
Nellie,"OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela."
Kevin,Yes!
Dwight,"Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?"
Kevin,Uh huh.
Dwight,"Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane."
Kevin,Of course.
Nellie,"Kevin, did you make that yourself?"
Kevin,Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Nellie,Oh man.
Dwight,I call for a refold!
Kevin,No.
Angela,Really? Thank you.
Kevin,This is flatter.
Dwight,It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Nellie,"Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one."
Kevin,"I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder."
Nellie,You have to choose one now.
Kevin,Fine.
Nellie,Angela advances.
Erin,Nice.
Dwight,Whoo!
Angela,Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Kevin,I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
Jim,An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
Pam,"Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea."
Jim,"Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip."
Pam,"Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture."
Director,We are rolling and...action!
Andy,"This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death."
Producer,"Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much?"
Andy,Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
Director,"Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one."
Andy,"So how do you want, how should I do it?"
Director,"I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok?"
Andy,This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
Director,Ok.
Andy,"It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster."
Director,Who was that?
Andy,Tom Brokaw!
Dwight,Come on Clark!
Angela,Come on Clark.
Dwight,Whoa!
Erin,Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
Clark,"We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil."
Erin,I can't hear what you said. You got your slop?
Clark,"You know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won..."
Pete,Erin! Erin! Just stop.
Erin,What?
Pete,Relax.
Nellie,Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.
"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration",You can do it baby!
Angela,No you can't baby! Good luck.
Dwight,Watch and learn.
Erin,Wow.
Group,Oh!
Nellie,"Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals."
Dwight,Yes!
Angela,Whoo!
Dwight,"Oh, Esther."
Esther,Hey.
Dwight,What are you- You're here early.
Esther,"Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow."
Dwight,I like a little feather in my nuggets.
Nellie,"Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars."
Erin,Yeah!
Director,"Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye."
Andy,Which is insanely painful.
Director,Yeah.
Andy,"And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain."
Director,"That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes. You know, get the chemicals out. Alright?"
Andy,So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
Director,What water special effect?
Producer,"Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs."
Andy,"I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-"
Director,"Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking."
Andy,"Darryl, what do I do?"
Darryl,"Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope."
Andy,They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Darryl,So?
Andy,I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper.
Production Assistant,"So Andy, so you know how to use this. You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes."
Andy,Carla! Carla!
Nellie,It is time for a little T & A. I give you
Angela,Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Nellie,"Well, Angela is the winner."
Angela,Yes!
Esther,Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
Dwight,"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything."
Esther,Oh. Is she a gambler?
Dwight,"In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song."
Esther,Hmm. That is sad.
Carla Fern,"Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera!"
Producer,What's the hold up here?
Director,The actor's crying.
Producer,Oh god.
Andy,She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
Darryl,Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Andy,Do you believe in me?
Darryl,I believe I want to go home.
Dwight,Yeah! Ok! Beat that! Whoo! Ok.
Erin,"Dammit! Dammit, god. Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels."
Pete,Yeah. Whoa!
Erin,Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Pete,"Ok Hey hey hey, whoa."
Erin,Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Pam,"Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting."
Jim,"Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar."
Pam,I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
Jim,Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
Pam,"Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-"
Jim,"Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good."
Pam,"Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice."
Jim,"Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair."
Pam,"Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?"
Jim,I guess I will swallow my truth.
Clark,"Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds."
Pam,We're not high.
Pam,I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
Kevin,The Mark 47 is ready for launch. Less paste.
Director,Here we go. Rolling and... action!
Andy,AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
Director,And cut. We can fix the sound in post.
Producer,Yeah.
Andy,I can do a better one.
Producer,"That's fine, we'll move on."
Andy,I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
Darryl,Action!
Andy,AHH! AHH! AHH!
Carla Fern,Kid can act!
Andy,Yeah! Yeah.
Nellie,Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
Dwight,After you.
Angela,Thank you. Oh god!
Nellie,"Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight."
Dwight,"Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God."
Esther,We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely.
Dwight,Alright.
Angela,Don't you dare tank this.
Nellie,And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Creed,Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
Angela,"Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely."
Angela,"I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok."
Jim,"I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?"
Pam,Ok.
Pam,Jim!
Jim,Thanks.
Pam,"Alright, have a good trip."
Jim,Bye.
Pam,Bye.
Jim,Hey! I...
Pastor,"Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. And now these three remain"
Pam,I love you.
Jim,I love you.
Jim,"I'm taking some time off from workâ€”well, my other workâ€”because we needed it."
David Wallace,"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come onâ€”what I was about to say was Dwightâ€” Oh, I'm sorry, I gottaâ€”This'll be a second, sorry."
Pam,It's great.
Dwight,Just wait and send it to voicemail.
Jim,It's great.
David Wallace,Yeah.
Pam,The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Dwight,Come on. Come on.
Jim,But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together.
David Wallace,Then we'll get him a new set of drums.
Pam,"Nice morning, too."
Dwight,Dwight Schrute is manager!
Jim,"Beesly! Oh, my god."
Andy,"Brava, brava."
Andy,Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial.
Creed,Creed Bratton is the new manager!
Jim,"Ah, definitely blue."
Pam,What's going on?
Andy,"Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond?"
Kevin,Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it.
Jim,"For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thinâ€”"
Pam,"Congratulations, Dwight."
Andy,Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
Dwight,Pam.
Jim,"Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once you know."
Jim,"Congratulations, buddy."
Andy,"Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup."
Dwight,"Thank you, Jim."
Jim,"Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing."
Clark,"Congrats, Dwight."
Oscar,Is everything ok?
Dwight,Get out of Jim's seat.
Angela,No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Clark,But I fought for this seat.
Kevin,"Wait, all of them?"
Dwight,"You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram."
Angela,"Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house."
Pam,It's nice to have you back.
Oscar,"That'sâ€”that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry."
Dwight,So...
Angela,"It's the that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type."
Jim,So.
Kevin,I've never met anyone like that.
Dwight,I wanted to offer you a new position.
Angela,"And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone."
Jim,Let's hear it.
Oscar,"Angela, you still have your son."
Dwight,Assistant regional manager.
Angela,I guess.
Jim,Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.
Dwight,"Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, Thrasher, Crasher andâ€”"
Dwight,Jim.
Jim,Smasher!
Jim,I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.
Dwight,"Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts."
Dwight,"Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot."
Dwight,"I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt."
Jim,"Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus."
Dwight,"I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided."
Dwight,"So, all the numbers adding up?"
Jim,Fireball!
Oscar,"Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight."
Dwight,Ah! That's how it's done.
Dwight,Thank you.
Jim,That's pretty good. I feel safe.
Angela,Yes. Congratulations.
David Wallace,"Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?"
Kevin,"Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations."
Erin,"Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ""is Indian"" and was like, ""Is Indian what?"" Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way."
Angela,This is a big day for you.
Erin,"Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic."
Dwight,"Yes, it is. Carry on."
Erin,"Yes, there's Andy! Andy is in. I'm a good receptionist, I know he's in."
Andy,"How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It's cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself."
Andy,"David Walrus, in his native habitat."
Andy,Everyone! Changed my mind again.
David Wallace,"Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?"
Phyllis,"What's it now, dream or no dream?"
Andy,Yeah.
Andy,"Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?"
David Wallace,"This isn't going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ""The kind that's good for head shots."" And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it's gonna boost office morale. Now, he's a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired."
Jim,"Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice."
David Wallace,Andyâ€”
Andy,All in! Whoo!
Andy,"I'm gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream."
Andy,"Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all."
David Wallace,"Uh-huh, butâ€”"
Toby,"Okay, then, Andy."
Andy,"Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I'll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense."
Andy,"Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners."
David Wallace,So you think you've been too focused on your job?
Toby,"Andy, you know I can't do that. It'd be lying."
Andy,"At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany."
Andy,Seriously?
David Wallace,So youâ€”you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Toby,"Yeah, I'mâ€”"
Andy,"Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don'tâ€”it just... I owe it to myself and my future fans."
Andy,"Come on, just do it."
David Wallace,"Uh, well, I guess I can't stand in the way of a man's dream. And it seems like you have the gift."
Toby,I can't.
Andy,"Thank you, David."
Andy,"All right, fine, just know that you made me do this."
David Wallace,"There's probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?"
Toby,"Oh, come on. Andy, no."
Andy,Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry.
Andy,"God, Toby, don'tâ€”stop blocking my hand."
David Wallace,"Well, good luck."
Toby,"No, no."
Andy,Thank you. Not gonna need it.
Andy,This is yourâ€”you brought this on.
David Wallace,Okay.
Toby,"No, no. Andy."
David Wallace,Well that kind of worked out.
Andy,"Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!"
Creed,"I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole."
Angela,"This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. Andâ€”oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um... what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!"
Jim,"Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back."
Kevin,What do you think that was about?
Clark,"Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know?"
Andy,"David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite."
Jim,You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.
David Wallace,"We put the past behind us, though, Andy."
Clark,"Right. Well, I'm here to sell paper."
Andy,What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
Pam,Wow.
David Wallace,"Enough, Andy. Enough!"
Clark,"All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? Andâ€”and Wallace is here today. And I don't him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?"
Andy,"Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?"
Pam,it's okay. You can sit in the annex.
David Wallace,Oh my god.
Jim,What?
Andy,"Eleanor Roosevelt once said â€˜the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.' I think she's right. I feel calm now. I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing."
Pam,I'll come visit you.
Angela,Andy.
Jim,Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you.
Andy,Yeah.
Clark,"That's fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes."
Angela,What are you doing?
Andy,"Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever."
Andy,"Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top."
Oscar,"I can't say we didn't see it coming. But it's a sad day when anybody is fired. We're so sorry, Andy."
Angela,"Yeah, okay. That's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it."
David Wallace,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired."
Andy,"Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot tooâ€”"
Andy,"I wasn't fired. What are you talking about? I'm fired up, yes. Guys, I'mâ€”I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous."
Angela,Ugh.
Pam,"Oh, Andy."
Andy,But I justâ€”it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't...
Andy,"Yeah, so, I'll see you on the red carpet. See, that's how it works."
Angela,"No, that's notâ€”"
Phyllis,Andy sings beautifully. And he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at.
Andy,Rehashâ€”
Jim,"Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark."
Angela,"No, noneâ€”No, stop. It's justâ€”"
Pete,"Yeah, a little bit."
Andy,Exactly.
Jim,"Oh, wow. But, umâ€”Oh, I get that."
Angela,"Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy."
Pete,"Oh, no, no, no. No it's cool."
Andy,"Thanks, Angela. You too."
Jim,I get it.
Angela,Thanks.
Pete,"It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing."
Andy,"A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how."
Jim,"Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that."
Nellie,"Oh, good lord."
Darryl,I just think you're going into this a little fast.
Stanley,Can't you just leave?
Andy,"I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?"
Jim,"You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye."
Darryl,"Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack."
Andy,"Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall."
Andy,All right. I get it.
Dwight,You okay?
Andy,"The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel, that's chick stuff. So instead of saying, ""Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don't want you to leave."" You say something like, ""Hey, Andy, you're making the worst mistake of your life. You're not talented."" Well... right back at you, Darryl."
Angela,It's just a really nice song.
Andy,I'm gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Kevin,Awesome!
Stanley,"Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?"
Phyllis,Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He's not terrible.
Kevin,"Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!"
Stanley,Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Sensei,I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
Phyllis,"No, he's good."
Dwight,He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Stanley,He was good.
Sensei,"It's not a large room, I think they heard me."
Oscar,"Good night, Kevin."
Dwight,"Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself."
Kevin,"Night, Oscar."
Sensei,That's really ok. I'm mostly focused on the belt here.
Oscar,Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Dwight,Just slip it off myâ€”Slip it off my hips.
Angela,"Well, I've changed my mind."
Sensei,"Hold itâ€”Take a step back. Take a step back. Okay, okay. I can'tâ€”I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off."
Oscar,Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in aâ€”
Dwight,He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Angela,"Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?"
Angela,"Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying."
Oscar,"Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent."
Dwight,There it is.
Angela,"Oh, god."
Sensei,Congratulations.
Oscar,Come stay with me.
Dwight,"We did it, we did it. I love you."
Angela,You don't want me at your place.
Sensei,Okay.
Oscar,I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.
Dwight,Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?
Angela,Well...
Sensei,"Yes, I will."
Oscar,Separate bathrooms.
Dwight,"Sensei, you're not watching."
Angela,Thank you.
Sensei,"Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it."
Oscar,You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff...
Dwight,Watching?
Angela,Okay.
Sensei,I'm watching.
Oscar,And get you the hell outta that place.
Dwight,"Watch this part, okay?"
Angela,Are you allowed to have pets?
David Wallace,"Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?"
Oscar,"Oh, Angela."
Sensei,"Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world."
Dwight,"Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day."
David Wallace,"He said that? He's an odd guy, isn't he?"
Darryl,You talk to Wade and Colin?
Sensei,"Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he's one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met."
Jim,"No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?"
Esther,"Oh! I'm am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue."
Darryl,We got an offer on the table.
Jim,"I really felt like I almost lost her, andâ€”and nothing is worth that."
Jim,What kind of offer?
David Wallace,"Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals."
Darryl,A buyout.
Clark,"Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam."
Jim,What?
Dwight,You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.
Darryl,"We're in play, baby."
Clark,"All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job."
Jim,"Oh, my god!"
Dwight,"Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager."
Darryl,"We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it's not just a Philly play, so get this"
David Wallace,"So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on."
Jim,"Wow, that is... wow."
Jim,Again.
Darryl,"Yeah, we did it."
David Wallace,"Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?"
Jim,"Yeah, we did. Hey, how longâ€”how long do we think that's gonna take?"
Jim,Not at all. It should be Dwight.
Darryl,Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
David Wallace,You sure?
Jim,"Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it."
Jim,"You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uhâ€”"
Darryl,Can't do what?
David Wallace,Yeah.
Jim,"This, man. I can't do this to Pam."
Jim,"Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person."
Darryl,"No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything."
Nellie,"Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word."
Jim,I know. And I can't do it.
Andy,It's now or never.
Angela,So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Nellie,"Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive."
Oscar,"No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up."
Andy,"Yeah, sure. What's your question?"
Angela,I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Kevin,Our question isâ€”it seems dumb.
Oscar,"Angela, you just wereâ€”"
Andy,"Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?"
Angela,I love him.
Nellie,"Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ""full-ass"" it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?"
Oscar,"I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. Youâ€”you can'tâ€”"
Andy,Nah. I like my plan better.
Angela,"No, not the senator. I love Dwight."
Kevin,"Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor."
Andy,What?
Oscar,"No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?"
Jim,"Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?"
Pam,Yes. Yeah.
Jim,"I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens."
Pam,"Oh, boy. Umâ€”"
Jim,"If you could help me out, that would beâ€”"
Pam,I could give you some beginner stickies?
Jim,Anything would help.
Pam,Here you go.
Jim,"Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that."
Pam,Mm-hmm.
Jim,"Wow, that'sâ€”"
Pam,It's all yours.
Jim,You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Dwight,"You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that."
Jim,"Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great."
Dwight,Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
Jim,No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Dwight,"Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed."
Jim,I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.
Dwight,Hello.
Andy,"Well, hello."
Dwight,Big day for you.
Andy,Big day for you.
Dwight,Thank you.
Andy,Love the belt.
Dwight,"Oh, yes."
Andy,"You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!"
Dwight,This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Andy,"Thank you, I appreciate that. â€˜Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it."
Dwight,"Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?"
Andy,"No, I just applied for more overdraft protection."
Dwight,"Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job."
Andy,"Nothing is impossible to him who will try. Alexander the Great, if he were cockney."
Dwight,You're bad.
Andy,I'm gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Andy,"Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That's something you can't take back."
Erin,"So true. Is there a question, or areâ€”what?"
Andy,"Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?"
Erin,"Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve."
Andy,Thank you.
David Wallace,"You can stay on as a salesman, Andy."
Andy,Thank you.
David Wallace,"Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?"
Dwight,Say it again.
David Wallace,Will you be the new manager?
Dwight,Where?
David Wallace,Where?
Dwight,What branch?
David Wallace,"Here. Scranton. Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news."
Dwight,"I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun."
David Wallace,What?
Dwight,But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute... Manager.
David Wallace,Why do you already have this?
Dwight,"In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David."
David Wallace,I know.
Dwight,"I will never, ever let you down."
David Wallace,"I know, Dwight. I know. Okay. Okay. All righty. You're gonna do great."
Pam,Hey.
Jim,"Wow, hey."
Pam,Hi.
Jim,What's up?
Pam,"Um, I have a question."
Jim,Okay.
Pam,"Oh, I had a question."
Jim,Really?
Pam,I did!
Jim,"Yeah, totally you did."
Pam,Super important.
Jim,I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Pam,Okay.
Jim,All right? I'm gonna wait.
Pam,All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
Jim,I'm sure you did not. What was your question?
Pam,"I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out."
Jim,"Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting."
Pam,Exactly.
Andy,"Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales."
Nellie,"Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet."
Meredith,"Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don't want to see you in a p0rn next year."
Andy,Okay.
Kevin,"Ooh, there's a great play about a salesman."
Andy,Death of a salesman.
Kevin,I don't think so.
Andy,"Sure, â€˜Death of a Salesman' by Arthur Miller, it's a great play about crushed dreams."
Kevin,"No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants."
Andy,Got any hot leads?
Pete,"See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward."
Erin,I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep.
Jim,Look who's back.
Pam,"I'm back. Oh, hey, look, and now it's like a double date."
Pete,"Wow. Cause, uh"
Erin,"Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That'd be fun."
Pam,"Yeah, we should do that for real sometime."
Erin,"Well, how about Thursday?"
Pam,"Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because ofâ€”"
Jim,Weeknights are actually tough just becauseâ€”
Pam,They are.
Jim,"That's true, yeah."
Erin,Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
David Wallace,"Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schruteâ€”"
Dwight,"David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?"
David Wallace,I don't think so.
Dwight,It's just one thing. Just let meâ€”let me do thisâ€”
Erin,The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Pam,"Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm justâ€”I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much."
Erin,A paper company.
Kevin,But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.
Jim,"This was my decision, not yours."
Bartender,How many people want the game? Who wants PBS? Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.
Dwight,Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project
Pam,Okay.
Kevin,"Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places."
Erin,The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Jim,You didn't force me.
Andy,One more for the doc.
Dwight,But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Pam,I kind of forced you to do it.
Bartender,All right.
Erin,Close.
Jim,You did not force me to do this.
Kevin,Yes!
Dwight,"This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?"
Pam,"Yes, I did."
Clark,"Hey, how was the singing show audition?"
Erin,Colder.
Jim,I don't know how else to tell you.
Andy,"Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal."
Dwight,The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Pam,I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid thatâ€”
Creed,"Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!"
Erin,"No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, ""the coffee in Peru is much hotter."""
Jim,Resent you?
Kevin,I feel scared a little.
Dwight,"Ah, much, ok."
Pam,This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.
Phyllis,"Yeah, I'm not ready for this."
Erin,"But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. Unless you want me to break protocol?"
Jim,Is that really what you think?
Stanley,No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is.
Dwight,"No, no. Give me the steam."
Oscar,"One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same."
Dwight,"It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd."
Jim,Here we go.
Dwight,Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Creed,"Oh, I'm saving a fortune on dry cleaning."
Jim,"Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys."
Philip,Mama!
Camera Crew,"Okay. You got it, man."
Oscar,"Angela, someone wants you."
Darryl,I didn't realize we were this close.
Angela,"Ok, coming. Hi, baby."
Phyllis,We're all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Oscar,"Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o."
Meredith,Are you gonna come to Poor Richard's and watch with us tonight?
Oscar,Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Darryl,Uh... yeah. Depending on traffic.
Esther,"Go get â€˜em, honey."
Stanley,He ain't coming.
Dwight,"Oh, don't worry. They'll get got."
Erin,"Oh, god!"
Dwight,Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check... on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
Darryl,These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Andy,"Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick."
Darryl,"Well, it's been great."
Check-in guy,"Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line."
Phyllis,Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he's gone for who knows how long.
Andy,Yes!
Darryl,Maybe forever. Anyhowâ€”
Andy,"Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!"
Oscar,"Did we ever have lunch together, justâ€”just the two of us? You know what, I'm gonna make reservations right now at Cugino's."
Jim,Sales form for you to sign.
Meredith,Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Dwight,You know what to do. Ok
Darryl,"Oh, oh, I'm sure we did."
Dwight,"Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best."
Meredith,"Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl."
Jim,"Aw, thanks, man."
Clark,"Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get."
Dwight,"Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World Warâ€”"
Erin,"Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we'll get this started."
Jim,No.
Darryl,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental."
Dwight,Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Meredith,You have to!
Jim,Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Darryl,"Hey, hey, hey. I'll do one thing with y'all."
Pam,"Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting."
Phyllis,Which thing?
Jim,"All depends on the conference room meeting itself. Uh, okay."
Darryl,"I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though."
Pam,Is that them again?
Angela,"Kevin, Kevin."
Jim,Yeah.
Kevin,"Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking."
Pam,Maybe you should call back?
Angela,"Kevin, could you not do that?"
Jim,I will. I will.
Kevin,"What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work."
Jim,"The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I'm not risking that again."
Oscar,"Here, use my pen."
Pam,"When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim."
Kevin,Don't tell me what to do!
Dwight,Welcome.
Angela & Oscar,Shhh!
Jim,He welcomes you.
Kevin,"No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me."
Dwight,Please take an agenda item.
Angela,"Kevin, where are you going?"
Jim,Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Kevin,Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Dwight,"Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ""Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try."" That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you."
Oscar,He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper.
Jim,"Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, ""Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future."" Ok? That's nonsense."
Angela,I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Pam,Question.
Dwight,Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.
Jim,"Yes, beautiful girl in the front."
Andy,"Hey, what's goin' on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young'uns?"
Pam,"We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ""Nice jugs""?"
Casey,You're back!
Jim,That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Andy,"No, it's me, Andy!"
Everyone,Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense.
Casey,"No, I know."
Dwight,What is going on?
Andy,"No, no, no. I'm wearing makeup."
Angela,Daycare won't take Phillip anymore.
Casey,You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
Oscar,Why?
Andy,"Oh, I took out my lifts."
Angela,"Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi."
Casey,Oh.
Oscar,"Hi, buddy."
Andy,"Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height."
Dwight,"Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today."
Casey,Oh.
Jim,"Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?"
Esther,"All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs."
Meredith,"I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap."
Dwight,"Oink the pigs, that is very important."
Stanley,"Over the course of this documentary I've had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble"
Esther,"Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?"
Dwight,"I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month."
Dwight,The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Kevin,"Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions."
Dwight,"Thank you, Esther."
Oscar,"I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having s*x with women. As was Kevin, I believe."
Esther,Bye.
Creed,"This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast."
Andy,"This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ""I Dreamed a Dream"" from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic."
Jim,"You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?"
Casey,"Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you."
Dwight,I need you to perform a test.
Andy,No!
Jim,Perform a test.
Casey,America wants it!
Dwight,On an innocent baby.
Andy,"No, this is my time! You don't belt on my time! I belt on my time."
Jim,"Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz."
Casey,Casey Dean!
Dwight,Damn straight.
Andy,Casey Dean!
Jim,Unless you think he can't handle it.
Casey,"Man, those are some nice pipes."
Dwight,"Hey, he can handle it."
Andy,Yeah.
Jim,All right.
Casey,What's your name?
Oscar,"Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley's sleeping. You don't want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?"
Andy,Andy. What's yours?
Stanley,I heard that.
Angela,Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
Phillip,Mama.
Oscar,Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
Dwight,"Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps."
Kevin,Guys.
Pam,He does have a gift.
Angela,"Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong."
Oscar,"Well, he's calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites."
Kevin,Guys.
Phillip,Mama.
Angela,Why don't you pack it?
Dwight,Okay. You ever been in a manager's office before?
Kevin,Guys.
Dwight,"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called ""Schrute or Consequences."" You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?"
Angela & Oscar,"Kevin, what?"
Phillip,Beet.
Kevin,"Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ""bold front"" instead of ""cold front""? It's insane."
Dwight,"Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes."
Angela,"Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks."
Check-in guy,"Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions."
Oscar,"Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store."
People in line,Oh come on! Hey!
Angela,"Ok, you go to the store."
Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?"
Kevin,"Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip."
Check-in guy,But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensaâ€”
Dwight,Not now! Private time!
Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. You can't do that, we've all been waiting."
Jim,I love Star Wars as much as the next guyâ€”
Check-in guy,Okay.
Dwight,"Hey, hey! Seriously?"
Andy,I am going in there! Don'tâ€”
Jim,"My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for it"
Check-in guy,"No, you're not, sir."
Dwight,"Which is, of course..."
Andy,Don'tâ€”don'tâ€”
Jim,Potential future nonsense.
Check-in guy,Please don't.
Dwight,"Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me."
Andy,Don't touch me.
Jim,I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.
Check-in guy,I'm not touching you. Okay?
Dwight,The power source.
Casey,"Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't getâ€”I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm Casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won't be seeing the last of me!"
Jim,"Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager."
Oscar,Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Dwight,"A loyal, but bungling apostle."
Dwight,That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Jim,But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Kevin,He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.
Dwight,Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Andy,"Hi. You're still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're like, my three favorite people ever."
Jim,Exactly.
Santigold,What is this?
Dwight,"I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?"
Andy,"Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show, so it's someone else's turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, my name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart."
Jim,"Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests."
Aaron Rodgers,"No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on."
Dwight,I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Andy,"Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that."
Jim,"Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?"
Clay Aiken,"No, we do not want to hear you sing."
Dwight,"That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard."
Santigold,Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
Casey,What're you listening to?
Andy,"Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern."
Andy,"Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440."
Aaron Rodgers,Flag on the play.
Casey,"Oh, sweet."
Andy,"That'sâ€”that's whatâ€”yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song. Far above Cayuga's waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma materâ€”"
Andy,"A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch."
Santigold,What is this song?
Mark McGrath,"What's up, everybody? And welcome to America's Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!"
Andy,Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song.
Casey,Ah! It's Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You're gorgeous!
Clay Aiken,"Listen, all right, thank you very much, we're not interested."
Mark McGrath,"Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!"
Andy,You didn't let me finish. That's not fair.
Andy,There's a mole?
Aaron Rodgers,"Look, man, you're not terrible. We've heard a lot of really good singers today and you're just not good enough."
Mark McGrath,"Oops. I'm not supposed toâ€”I'm not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?"
Andy,"Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. Let me try a different song, okay?"
Andy,What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Aaron Rodgers,Can he do this?
Mark McGrath,"Good man right there. I'll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?"
Andy,"Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you're never fully dressed without a smile. Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummellyâ€”"
Andy,Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
Santigold,"Look, you gotta go. You can't just sit here and cry."
Casey,What? On a roll much?
Andy,Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Andy,I don't know where it came from.
Jim,Thank you.
Casey,"That was amazing, man!"
Oscar,"Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?"
Andy,"Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny."
Kevin,Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Casey,"Yeah, you made a personal connection with him."
Oscar,"Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something."
Andy,"I did, I felt it."
Angela,"Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes."
Casey,Big time.
Oscar,"I think there's, like, $7 left."
Pam,What are you so excited about?
Angela,"It's just his way of saying, ""Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting."""
Jim,Nothing.
Kevin,Phillip got this for me?
Pam,What are you up to?
Oscar,Sure.
Jim,"Members of the office, hear ye."
Kevin,That was a really cool move.
Dwight,"That means ye, Plop!"
Angela,Would you like to hold Phillip? Yeah. That's Kevin.
Pete,Plop? Still?
Kevin,Whoa.
Dwight,We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Oscar,Easy.
Pete,Fine.
Kevin,What a chubbers. Whoa.
Jim,Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Angela,"Okay, watch it."
Erin,"Aw, heck ya!"
Kevin,I'm losing my balance.
Pam,Nice.
Angela,"No, Kevin, no."
Dwight,"You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending."
Oscar,"Hey, no."
Jim,"This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring."
Kevin,Whoa!
Dwight,"Wow, the honor. God, I envy them."
Oscar,No horseplay.
Jim,He envies you.
Angela,Stop it.
Dwight,"You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it."
Kevin,You wanna play with the cactus?
Jim,Alright.
Angela,"No, no!"
Jim,By 2
Kevin,"So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you."
Darryl,What up?
Erin,We have our decision.
Glenn,What's going on? How was the delivery?
Darryl,You chose one thing?
Darryl,"Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here."
Erin,We want to dance with you.
Darryl,"I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all."
Darryl,You want to dance?
Jim,"A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?"
Erin,"One dance, all of us together."
Meredith,"Uh, two."
Darryl,This is what you want?
Jim,"985,000,000,000,017.00"
Erin,Absolutely.
Dwight,"Not even close, Meredith. Come on!"
Darryl,"Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we're gonna do this right."
Jim,"Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?"
Erin,Yes!
Pam,Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Angela,Hey. You wanted to see me?
Jim,"Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World."
Dwight,Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
Dwight,"Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job."
Angela,I am sorry he's here today but I hadâ€”
Jim,"That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?"
Dwight,"I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal."
Pete,A horse.
Angela,How thoughtful.
Jim,"Ew, the exact opposite, actually."
Dwight,"Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet."
Pete,What's the opposite of a horse?
Angela,"If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son."
Jim,Come on.
Dwight,Very well.
Jim & Dwight,Sea horse.
Angela,Can I go back to my desk now?
Jim,Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaâ€”
Dwight,Yes.
Jim & Dwight,Say that? Uncanny.
Pam,What is this?
Jim,"Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?"
Jim,"Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so I needed a little help."
Clark,Yeah.
Dwight,Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Jim,Do you want a corn dog?
Jim,"OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so."
Clark,I would love a corn dog.
Dwight,Now.
Jim,"We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message."
Jim,"I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip."
Clark,"Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went."""
Dwight,Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
Dwight,"No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations."
Pam,Go ahead.
Jim,Uncanny.
Jim,"Ok, um, this is...â€”I'll be right back."
Soldier,"I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they'll feel like anything is possible."
Jim,What do we got?
Andy,"Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you."
Dwight,I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Casey,"Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids."
Jim,"Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step."
Andy,What?
Dwight,"She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest."
Casey,Yeah.
Jim,Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.
Andy,Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Dwight,"Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm."
Casey,I don't know. But I'm getting really worried here.
Jim,That's a lot of pros.
Andy,Me too. Hold my place in line.
Dwight,"And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up."
Casey,Where are you going?
Jim,So what is the problem?
Andy,They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Dwight,Angela.
Darryl,"Thanks, man."
Hank,Thank you.
Jim,"I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation."
Darryl,Yep. Take care.
Dwight,Some sort of virus?
Pam,"Darryl, hey."
Jim,Love.
Darryl,Hey.
Dwight,Oh.
Pam,"Cool, are you coming back to say hi?"
Darryl,"No, no, I'm not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn't say goodbye to."
Jim,"Dwight, listen"
Pam,Aha. How's Athlead?
Dwight,"You're a good assistant, Jim."
Darryl,We livin' like rock stars. I'm about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Jim,Not as good as you.
Pam,Wow.
Dwight,That's very true. Get the hell outta here.
Darryl,Jim really doesn't want to come?
Jim,You got it.
Pam,He says he doesn't want to.
Darryl,Wow. Man. I hope he doesn't regret it.
Jim,You watched it.
Pam,"Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin."
Pam,Yeah.
Darryl,"Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?"
Jim,"Well, then I guess you're ready for this."
Pam,That's what he says.
Pam,What's that?
Darryl,"If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then."
Jim,It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note. Not enough for me? You are everything.
Jim,"An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?"
Pam,Thank you.
Dwight,A thousand times more.
Erin,"Ok, everybody ready?"
Phyllis,I'll try this one.
Phyllis,"Hit it, red!"
Jim,"Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course."
Darryl,I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys.
Phyllis,Hot!
Oscar,"Ok, I've got myâ€”"
Jim,"Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!"
Meredith,"See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right?"
Dwight,"No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?"
Oscar,"All right, Meredith."
Jim,Look at that form.
Angela,"Okay, bye."
Dwight,"Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!"
Oscar,See you there.
Jim,Uncanny.
Kevin,"Bye, Phillip. High five."
Erin,Darryl?! Darryl!
Oscar,"Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at Poor Richard's in an hour."
Kevin,Whoa.
Angela,Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off?
Darryl,"Oh, hey. Hey, what's up, y'all?"
Oscar,She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up.
Erin,You left us without saying goodbye.
Angela,"All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!"
Darryl,"Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody."
Oscar,"Oh, my goodness."
Meredith,Hey! No way!
Dwight,Pull over!
Kevin,That's totally uncool.
Angela,Dwight?
Erin,Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Dwight,Move to the side of the road!
Darryl,I don't think I sh-
Angela,Why?
Erin,"Get upstairs, mister!"
Dwight,Pull over!
Meredith,Yeah!
Angela,What do youâ€”Dwight!
Kevin,Right. Now.
Angela,Dwight! What the is your problem!
Darryl,Guess I'm going upstairs.
Dwight,"Shut up, woman!"
Jim,"You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingâ€”none of these people are good enough."
Angela,Who drives like that?
Dwight,I know.
Dwight,Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Jim,"What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said."
Angela,Can you put that down?
Dwight,"Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-"
Dwight,This expresses how loudly I love you.
Jim,Is-
Angela,It's too loud.
Dwight,Me.
Dwight,"This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites."
Jim,The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Angela,"Okay, yesâ€”yes, I will! I love you!"
Dwight,Yes! Thank you.
Dwight,I love you!
Jim,"I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. That's it. You look really, really good."
Angela,And I lied to you.
Dwight,"Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?"
Dwight,What?
Jim,Hey.
Angela,Phillip's your son.
Pam,Hey.
Dwight,What? Why would you say thatâ€”
Jim,You all right? What's going on?
Angela,I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Pam,Are you happy?
Dwight,Get out! I'm a dad!
Jim,"Yes, I'm happy."
Angela,You're a dad!
Pam,"No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today."
Creed,"Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor's up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. Oh!"
Jim,Yeah.
Erin,You have to change the channel to PBS.
Pam,And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Kevin,Yeah.
Jim,What?
Bartender,College baseball is on.
Pam,What about five years from now?
Erin,But there's a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Jim,Pam.
Bartender,What's it about?
Dwight,The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
Dwight,You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Jim,"Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note."
Camera Man,We're getting bonus footage for the DVD.
Jim,"Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet."
Dwight,Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
Dwight,"pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore."
Dwight,Waste of a good hatchet.
Pam,Thanks Dwight.
Camera Man,It'll be a pledge gift.
Jim,"Okay, just talk."
Jim,"Hey, and if you're ever in Austin..."
Dwight,PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Kevin,"Well, w..."
Dwight,"Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn."
Dwight,"In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a ""where are they now"" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go."
Dwight,"I heard you say ""well"" the first time."
Jim,There it is.
Dwight,"Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring."
Jim,I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Dwight,"Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So... have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So...yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates."
Kevin,"Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!"
Dwight,It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.
Andy,You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me
Stanley,"Ah, I've been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old."
Kevin,You're just saying that to make me feel better.
Kevin,"Oh, Yes!"
Meredith,Speech!
Dwight,"No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer."
Darryl,You did good. Real good.
Dwight,No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin.
Kevin,Is that all it was?
Andy,Thanks Dad...Darryl.
Kevin,"Yes! Wait, why?"
Dwight,That's it.
Andy,"I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. Someone should write a song about that."
Dwight,Go ahead and just read the frosting.
Kevin,Come here
Oscar,"You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way...And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami."
Kevin,"""Get out."""
Dwight,I missed you Kevin.
Creed,Uh..ohh!
Dwight,Uh-huh.
Kevin,I missed you!
Creed,I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. â€˜Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same...
Kevin,What does that mean?
Dwight,Ohh.
Jim,"Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's...an amazing gift."
Dwight,"It's a colloquial way of saying ""you're fired,"" Kevin, which you are."
Phyllis,"Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome."
Pam,"What? Dwight, you can't do that."
Jim,Thanks Phyl.
Dwight,The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
Creed,I still have my medal from that.
All,What?!
Mose,Guten Prank.
Angela,Do you even have a mattress?
Dwight,Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Jim,"Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three."
Creed,"No, but I still have my medal from that."
All,Dwight...
Dwight,You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Kevin,Oscar. Oscar. I think I'm gay.
Dwight,Based...on his merit.
Dwight,"Mose! What..ooh, Mose."
Oscar,Why do you say that?
Oscar,Ooh.
Angela,What the is your problem you?!
Kevin,It's just that I'm so emotional.
Jim,Umm....
Jim,"Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or..."
Oscar,"Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay."
Kevin,I'm...good.
Dwight,No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Kevin,"No, but maybe the reason..."
Pam,"Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so..."
Jim,Right.
Oscar,You're not gay.
Toby,"Yeah. Yeah, I don't think..."
Stanley,Hey guys.
Creed,And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
Dwight,"Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. Bye, bye Toby."
All,Stanley!
Erin,"How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?"
Kevin,At least I got chocolate.
Erin,How's Florida?
Darryl,"Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?"
Jim,"I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too."
Stanley,"Oh, great."
Creed,"It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But... no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. Let's do this."
Jim,Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Stanley,"Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds."
Meredith,I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they're the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You're not alone sister. Let's get a beer sometime.
Crowd,Whoo! Yeah
Jim,Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Phyllis,I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
Jim,Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Pam,"No, no, I'm fine."
Jim,"I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid...wonderful...boring...amazing job."
Jim,And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Jim,Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Pam,I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all...I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?
Pam,"Angela, are you ready for the wedding?"
Stanley,I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
Angela,"Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet. They're like the paws of an orangutan."
Andy,I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
Pam,"I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much."
Dwight,That is all. Have a good morning.
Kevin,People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Meredith,Thank you.
Kevin,"Yeah, people hate you."
Dwight,What was that for?
Andy,I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home.
Angela,To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful.
Man,Hey! It's Andy Bernard!
Dwight,Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
All,Nard Dog! Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Angela,"D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me."
Andy,Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Dwight,"Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him."
Man 1,How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?
Angela,I don't...I don't know why.
David Wallace,"It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it."
Dwight,"I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ""The Grass Roots"" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military."
Dwight,With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Phyllis,"Oh, some fudge?"
Pete,"Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So... thanks PBS."
Malcolm,"Oh, thanks. I love your fudge."
Woman 1,"Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we'd all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?"
Phyllis,Thanks.
Pam,"Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something."
Malcolm,I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
Jim,She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.
Phyllis,"Oh, you can afford it."
All,Awww.
Phyllis,"After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But...he'll get there."
Jim,O-Kay.
Jim,"Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready â€˜cause I want to pack in a lot."
Woman 2,"All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that... he could do anything. Anything."
Zeke,Party time! Whorehouse!
Pam,I'm sorry. Is there a question?
Jim,"Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?"
Woman 2,"Uh, no."
Zeke,"Well, you're the bestisch mensch."
Man 2,"Pam, what was in that teapot letter?"
Jim,"Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. ""Guten Pranken""."
Pam,"Oh, um, well, you know, I... I just... I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself."
Dwight,"Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight."
Man 2,I hear ya. What did it say?
Clark,"Great, now we got three hours to fill."
Moderator,We're gonna move on. Next question please.
Jim,"Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?"
Man 3,Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?
Dwight,"Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing."
Toby,Yes.
Jim,Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.
Woman 3,I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?
Andy,"Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say"
Meredith,"I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn't show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college."
Woman 4,"I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?"
Casey Dean,You can't just sit here and cry.
Jim,"Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish."
Andy,"Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!"
Pam,"Listen, um... I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end. And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it."
Andy,Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Woman 4,Like Harry Potter.
Pam,"Yeah, like Harry Potter."
Bill Hader,
Joan,I have a question for Erin.
Seth Mayers,"Oh, Don't. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don't be such a baby."
Erin,Really?
Bill Hader,
Joan,"Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother."
Seth Mayers,"Oh, No. It's gonna be alright."
Erin,Thank you.
Bill Hader,
Joan,"So my question is, um, do... don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her."
Seth Mayers,It's gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I'm Seth Meyers. That's Baby Wawa. Good night.
Erin,"Maybe sometimes. But not like ""hate"" hate. More just like, ""Mom, I hate you!"" And then she would say ""go to your room, young lady."" And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks."
Bill Hader,Bye!
Joan,Erin...
Andy,"After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. Not really my scene."
Erin,Yes?
Oscar,"Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you...hold on."
Joan,"Um...Oh, Erin.."
Dakota,Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means.
Erin,Yes? Is there a follow-up question? Mom?
Oscar,"That's the reason Kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, ""A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven."" He was home by 4"
Ed,Erin... Same question but about your dad?
Nellie,"Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone."
Moderator,"Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today. Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don't forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic."
Toby,Hello! Hello!
Kevin,"Where's the, uh, basket for gifts?"
Nellie,Oh.
Usher,"Right there, sir."
Toby,Hi!
Kevin,Okay.
Nellie,No.
Dakota,"Hi, I'm Dakota."
Toby,Oh.
Creed,Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
Nellie,How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Dakota,Nice.
Toby,"Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?"
Creed,My wife's name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
Nellie,No. And I thought I unfriended you.
Kelly,"Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister."
Toby,Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
Ravi,"Thanks for helping out, sweetie."
Toby,"[alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know â€˜cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave."
Ryan,"Kelly, you're here."
Andy,Hey-OH!
Kelly,"Hey, Ryan!"
Meredith,Andy?
Ryan,Hey.
Oscar,You're back?
Kelly,"Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?"
Andy,Yeah.
Ryan,"No, this little guy is mine."
Malcolm,"That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!"
Ryan,"So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book."
Jim,"Hey man, good to see you."
Ryan,"Say ""hi"", Drake."
Andy,"Thank you. Yeah,"
Kelly,Drake is your baby's name?
Phyllis,. Andy...
Ryan,Yeah.
Andy,Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Kelly,That is an amazing name. I'm obsessed with Drake. His last album... it just touched me to pieces.
Phyllis,"Andy, I've been worried about you. How are you?"
Ryan,"No Kelly, he's no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It's Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake."
Andy,A little warm.
Kelly,"Cool. Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I'm obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos."
Phyllis,"Poor, poor Andy."
Ravi,"They're called premature, sweetie. It's good to see you again Ryan."
Andy,Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
Phyllis,Let me help you us.
Darryl,"Hello, hello."
Angela,Thanks. Oh. Ouch.
Jim,Hey!
Pam,"Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high."
Meredith,Darryl!
Angela,"No, my heels aren't too high. It's because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. Sorry Phyllis. You didn't know. As long as I can get to the altar."
Andy,Hey!
Phyllis,"Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank."
Darryl,"Hey, what's up?"
Jim,You ready?
Andy,Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Dwight,You kidding? I was born ready.
Darryl,What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Jim,"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but... we have a little bit of a problem."
Andy,Hmm.
Dwight,"Oh, no. What?"
Darryl,"Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um...I didn't call â€˜cause I figured you changed the number."
Jim,The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Andy,No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Dwight,"Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing."
Dwight,What? Ooh!
Jim,"I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-"
Andy,Surprise!
Dwight,Not... significant is a big word...
Dwight,I thought you guys couldn't come.
Jim,"I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way..."
Darryl,"Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet."
Dwight,I think you're only a teeny...
Jim,"Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ""Guten Prank"" number one."
Jim,"Either way, Dwight... I can't be there for you. I'm sorry."
Darryl,You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Dwight,Jim.
Dwight,"Uh, better ask Jim."
Jim,I just...really wish there was something I could do.
Jim,And Jim will say nothing.
Dwight,Michael. I can't believe you came.
Pam,Darryl! Andy!
Michael,That's what she said.
Andy,Hey! Pam!
Jim,Best prank ever.
Darryl,"Hey, Pam! How are you?"
Minister,"As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do."
Pam,We're fine. Yeah. And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?
Nellie,"See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?"
Andy,Mm-hmm.
Kevin,"""Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. """
Pam,"Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time."
Minister,I now pronounce you man and wife. Release the doves!
Darryl,I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
Kelly,Oh.
Jim,Yeah?
Kevin,That's not...
Darryl,"Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real."
Dwight,"Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab â€˜em on in there."
Jim,"Wow! That sounds incredible.. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to."
Oscar,"Whoo, whoo, whoo."
Dwight,Everybody!
Pam,"Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy."
Jim,"See, now you don't owe me anything."
Oscar,Yeah!
Ryan,Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he's hot.
Andy,Aw!
Ravi,"Oh, no."
Darryl,Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever.
Ryan,I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Oscar,They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clichÃ©. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Ravi,"Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?"
Oscar,WASSUUUUP!
Ryan,"Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water."
Dwight,"Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary."
Ravi,Are you sure you don't wanna go in?
Jim,Get out.
Kelly,"Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go."
Dwight,"Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim?"
Ryan,Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Jim,"No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking."
Kelly,"I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good."
Dwight,A bazooka. You remembered.
Ryan,He'll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He's allergic but he'll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Jim,Of course I did.
Kelly,You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?
Dwight,. Get out of my way.
Pam,Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
All,OH!
Pam,"Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!"
Dwight,Woo! Okay!
Pam,He just so happy to have a family plan.
Jim,Yeah! Guten Prank number two.
Ed,Where'd you learn to dance like that?
Jim,Private Room.
Erin,I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.
Oscar,"Yeah, brosef."
Toby,
Dwight,Amazing.
Pam,Is it me? Is it Nellie?
Jim,"Enjoy, enjoy."
Toby,It's everything.
Guy,"Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?"
Phyllis,I missed you.
Jim,"Okay, man, easy."
Stanley,I missed you too.
Guy,
Phyllis,Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. But would a grump make this? It's me. It's me.
Jim,"Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?"
Ryan,I love you.
Andy,"Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral."
Kelly,I love you too.
Darryl,That happens a lot?
Ryan,We're gonna be together forever.
Andy,"Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success."
Kelly,We're running off into the sunset.
Oscar,"Well, I bet it was a smash."
Ryan,I finally mastered commitment.
Andy,That's how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Kevin,What was that stuff?
Oscar,Is that a volunteer program or...
Ravi,"Hey, has anyone seen Ryan... or Kelly?"
Andy,No. It's a job. Things are going great.
Kevin,"Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together."
Darryl,"Let's get a drink in you, huh?"
Ravi,"Oh, that's it. Here. Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We'll find a better parent than Ryan in no time."
Andy,Yes.
Kevin,"Oh, I don't know."
Meredith,Whoo-hoo. Let's get this party started!
Nellie,"Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will... who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves."
Rachel,Where's my angel.
Kevin,"Hey, this is better."
Angela,This is my big sister Rachel.
Nellie,Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
Rachel,"No, this is my big sister Angela."
Nellie,"If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. Won't we?"
Angela,We're very close. We even have our own special language.
Michael,I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
Rachel,
Darryl,Thank you go much.
Angela,People love it.
Dwight,Good night.
Rachel,They do.
Toby,Good luck.
Dwight,"Man, how long have we been sitting here?"
Val,Great. It was really fun.
Stripper,"Hi, boys!"
Dwight,Good evening.
All,Ohh...
Val,The Doc crew's throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
Clark,Here we go!
Darryl,"Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. No offense. You going, Toby?"
Dwight,"Oh, Thank God. We are famished!"
Toby,"Oh, I don't know. I might turn in early."
Stripper,"Hey, did somebody order the chef special?"
Andy,It's only 6
Darryl,Right there.
Meredith,"You have to go, Toby."
Dwight,"No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?"
Pete,"Yeah, come on, Tobes."
Stripper,I bet you boys have a big appetite.
Val,Come on.
Dwight,"Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups."
Toby,Yeah. I'll stop by.
Stripper,"Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want."
Pete,There he is!
Dwight,"Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?"
Pam,I need to get out of this dress.
Stripper,"Ohh, shh."
Jim,I gotta get out of this dress.
Dwight,"Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good."
Carol Stills,"Oh, I'm sorry Pam."
Erin,Whoo!
Jim,What's going on?
Angela,What? Okay.
Pam,Why are you still here?
Pam,"Oh, boy."
Carol,I'm so sorry. They were an hour late.
Erin,Oh!
Jim,"No, really, what's going on?"
Jakey,Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever.
Pam,"Okay, Okay. Um... so... this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just... I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture... and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future."
Phyllis,Angela's special repairman is here.
Jim,"Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?"
Angela,"Wait, what is this?"
Pam,About 2 months
Meredith,Shut up. Jakey?
Jim,That's why it's so clean.
Jakey,Mom?
Pam,Yeah.
Pam,"Wait, wait. What?"
Jim,"I mean, you were gonna do this without me?"
Jakey,"Oh, man."
Pam,"Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you."
Meredith,"No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom's not here."
Jim,Oh... okay. Where would we go?
Pam,"Uh, that seems inappropriate."
Pam,Austin? Maybe.
Meredith,"Give the good show, my little entrepreneur."
Jim,"I promise you, you don't have to do this for me."
Jakey,Okay.
Pam,I'm doing it for us.
Meredith,"Take it off.. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper's only as good as his song."
Jim,The last...
Rachel,"oh, wowee wow."
Buyer,Okay. We'll take it.
Angela,Okay...
Jim,Hold on a second. The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about...
Pam,"Whoo-hoo...go, Meredith's stripper son."
Pam,"Hold on a second. Wait, what did you just say?"
Angela,"Rachel, are you all right?"
Buyer,We wanna buy your house.
Rachel,I don't know! I don't know.
Jim,You wanna do this?
Angela,"Oh geeze.. Oh, my God!"
Pam,I wanna do this.
Meredith,Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look.
Jim,You really want to do this?
Angela,"Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith."
Pam,I really want to do this!
Meredith,Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
Jim,Oh my God!
Angela,"Uh, no. It's o...thank you. You know what? You don't have to...oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay."
Jim,"Hey, Darryl."
Dwight,"Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic."
Darryl,What? All right!
Clark,"Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress."
Pam,We're so excited.
Dwight,You're telling me!
Phyllis,Cool.
Oscar,"If you want her to leave, just tip her."
Woman,"Oh, that's for PBS executives only."
Dwight,"What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?"
Stanley,I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
Angela,That was interesting. What was that?
David Wallace,"I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign."
Phyllis,It's just the wind.
Oscar,Thank you David.
Angela,Will you lock the door?
Pam,"Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper...,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. And go ahead!"
Phyllis,"Okay. It's just the wind, see? Nothing."
Pam,"Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just...I kind of meant just everybody from the office."
Angela,"Alright, see, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut... OH! My God!"
Photographer,"Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody."
All,
Jim,Let's go outside
Erin,Phyllis!
Pam,Okay.
Rachel,What's happening?
Stanley,"Okay, I need a drink."
Dwight,"Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow."
Kevin,"Yeah, we all need a drink. What the...there's only dandelion tea and raisins in here."
Jim,"Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled."
Meredith,"Hey, bottom drawer."
Dwight,Good old Mose.
Kevin,Yes!
Jim,They think it was Mose.
Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore."
Dwight,"Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung."
Pam,"I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But...it would just...just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ""be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long."""
Oscar,What is that?
Kevin,"If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural."
Dwight,"A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose."
Dwight,Hey guys.
Jim,Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?
Angela,Hi.
Dwight,Right. Which one is that?
All,Hey!
Jim,"Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?"
Pam,What about the honeymoon?
Jim,Is that Mose?
Angela,"Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?"
Dwight,"Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!"
Dwight,"Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? What is that meaningful look?"
Mose,"Well, first, buy us a drink."
Jim,You know what? Maybe we should talk.
All,"If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink."
Darryl,"Hey, come here. You guys need to see this."
Dwight,Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! Oh.
Kevin,What is it?
Kevin,"Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six ""wells."" Did I get that number right, Dwight?"
Andy,You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
Dwight,"I heard you bought a bar, Kevin."
Pam,I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing...
Kevin,Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Jim,Athleap.
Dwight,Why did you pick this place?
Pam,And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially...
Jim,Ooh.
Dwight,"No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!"
